A **contextual menu** provides convenient access to often-used commands associated with an item. You can think of a contextual menu as a shortcut to a small set of commands that make sense in the context of the current task. An object or selection can display a contextual menu when the user Control-clicks the object or selection.  
For example, Control-clicking a document icon displays a contextual menu that allows usersto perform several file-specific Finder actions.

Control-clicking a text selection displays a different contextual menu and one that is focused on text-specific actions. For example, the contextual menu displayed when users Control-click a text selection in a TextEdit document lists commands that allow them to change the font or check the spelling of the text.

**If appropriate, use an Action menu to make contextual menu functionality easier to access.** You can use an Action menu to provide an app-wide contextual menu control in a toolbar. For example, the Finder provides an Action menu toolbar control that allows users to get the same commands that are displayed in a contextual menu for the selected item. Forsome guidelines on how to use an Action menu,see ["Action](#page-260-0) Menu" (page 261).

**Include only the most commonly used commands that are appropriate in the current context.** For example, Edit menu commandsshould appear in the contextual menu for highlighted text, but a Save or a Print command should not.  
**Use caution when adding a submenu to a contextual menu.** Although you don't want a contextual menu to grow too long (too-long contextual menus display the scrolling indicator and scroll like standard menus), you also don't want to make them hard to use. Sometimes, users can find it difficult to maneuver the pointer so that the submenu stays open. If you decide to add submenus to your contextual menu, be sure to keep them to one level.  
**Don't set a default item in a contextual menu.** If the user opens the menu and closes it without selecting anything, no action should occur.  
**Always ensure that contextual menu items are also available as menu commands.** A contextual menu is hidden by default and a user might not know it exists,so itshould never be the only way to access a command. In particular, you should not use a contextual menu as the only way to access an advanced or power-user feature.  
**Don't display keyboard shortcuts in a contextual menu.** A contextual menu is a shortcut to a set of task-specific commands, so it's redundant to display the keyboard shortcuts for those commands. Note that you should continue to display keyboard shortcuts in your app menus, as described in ["Designing](#page-143-0) Menus for the Menu [Bar"](#page-143-0) (page 144).
