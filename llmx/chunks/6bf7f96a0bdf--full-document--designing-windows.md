## **Designing Windows**

The only windows that have a fixed size are miniwindows and icons. The initial size of all other windows is determined by the application. Generally, standard windows are larger than panels and panels are larger than menus, but there are no fixed rules.

When designing a panel or standard window, you should keep a substantial proportion of it free of objects that respond to the first click. It shouldn't be difficult for the user to find a place to click within the window to select it.

You should try to limit of the number of panels and standard windows that the user needs to use your application. Having too many windows results in a cluttered screen that can confuse the user. Even two windows can be too many if users can't tell which window they're supposed to work in. And a cluttered screen can frustrate the user's attempts to work in two or more applications at once.
