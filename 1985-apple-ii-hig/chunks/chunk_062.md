A user can change the extent of an existing selection by holding down the Open-Apple key and clicking the mouse button. (This is an unfortunate but unavoidable difference with MacIntosh, where Shift-click is used instead. Should Apple II hardware ever permit reading the shift key by itself, windowing software should accept either a Shift-click or an Open-Apple-click.) Exactly what happens next depends on the context.  
In text or an array, the result of an Open-Apple-click is always a range. The position where the button is clicked becomes the new endpoint or anchor point of the range; the selection can be extended in any direction. If the user clicks within the current range, the new range will be smaller than the old range.  
In graphics, a selection is extended by adding objects to it; the added objects do not have to be adjacent to the objects already selected. The user can add either an individual object or a range of objects to the selection by holding down the Open-Apple key before making the additional selection. If the user holds down the Open-Apple key and selects one or more objects that are already highlighted, the objects are deselected.  
Extended selections can be made across the panes of a split window. (See "Splitting Windows".)
