<span id="page-346-2"></span>Although there are many ways to arrange controls in a given window, there are guidelines you should follow so that your application has the clean, balanced Aqua look. This section provides examples of properly designed windows and alerts that use regular-size controls. For guidelines on the use of mini and small controls,see "Using Small and Mini Versions of [Controls"](#page-355-0) (page 356). Although some of the guidelines presented in this section are specific to the examples shown, most are general guidelines that are applicable to all windows.
