#### FontSize menu

Font sizes are measured in points. A point is <sup>a</sup> typographical unit of measure equivalent to 1/72 inch. The FontSize menu lists the nine standard available sizes. The font size currently in effect is indicated with a check mark (Figure 3-39). Not every font is available in all sizes; the sizes that are available for the selected font are shown outlined in the FontSize menu. A font can be scaled to the other sizes, but scaled fonts usually suffer in appearance on the screen and when printed by some kinds of printers.

This sentence is in 10-point type. The chapter title on the first page of this chapter is in 18-point type.

Figure 3-39 FontSize menu with standard font sizes

If there's insufficient room in the menu bar for the word FontSize, it can be abbreviated to Size. If there's insufficient room for both <sup>a</sup> Font menu and <sup>a</sup> Size menu, the sizes can be put at the end of the Style menu.
