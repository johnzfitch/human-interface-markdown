Each application and document window exists in its own layer, so documents from different applications can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the window was last accessed. When a user clicks an inactive document or chooses it from the Window menu, only that document, and any open utility windows, should be brought to the front. Users can bring all windows of an application forward by clicking its icon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the application's Window menu. These actions should bring forward all of the application's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order within the application. For more information, see ["The Window Menu"](#page-95-0) (page 96) and *Apple Software Design Guidelines*.  
Utility windows are always in the same layer, the top layer. They are visible only when their application is active.  
<span id="page-120-2"></span><span id="page-120-1"></span>Users can cycle forward or backward through all open document windows by using Command-' (acute accent) and Command-Shift-' (acute accent). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.  
#### <span id="page-120-0"></span>Main, Key, and Inactive Windows  
Windows have different looks based on how the user is interacting with them. The foremost document or application window that is the focus of the user's attention is referred to as the **main window**. The main window is often also the **key window**. The key window is the window that accepts user input, whether from the keyboard, mouse, or alternative input device.  
The main window is not always the key window though. There are times when a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window still remains the focus of the user's attention. For example, when a person is using an inspector, a Find dialog, or the Fonts or Colors windows, the document is the main window and the other window is the key window.  
If the main and key window are different windows, they are distinguished from one another by the look of their title bars.  
Main and key windows are both active windows. Active windows are visually distinct from **inactive windows** in that their controls have color, while the controls in inactive windows do not have color. Inactive windows are windows the user has open, but are not in the foreground. Main and key windows are always in the foreground and their controls always have color. Note the visual distinctions between main, key, and inactive windows in Figure 8-19.
