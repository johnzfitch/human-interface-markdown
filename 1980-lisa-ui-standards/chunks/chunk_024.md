To avoid unnecessary modes, commands are postfix rather than prefix. Some object is selected, and then an action on that object is specified. This allows the user time to check that the object has been selected correctly. It avoids modes, since the user may start a new task by making a new selection without having to terminate or cancel anything explicitly.
