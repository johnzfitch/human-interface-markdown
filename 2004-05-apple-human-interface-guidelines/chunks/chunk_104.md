Every document, application, and utility window should have, at a minimum:  
- A title bar. Even if the window does not have an actual title (a tools palette, for example), it should have a title bar so that users can move the window.
- A close button, so that the user has a consistent way to dismiss it.  
In addition, a standard document window has the following attributes that an application or utility window might not have:  
- <span id="page-102-2"></span>■ Scroll bars (if not all the window's contents are visible)
- Minimize and zoom buttons
- A proxy icon (after a document has been saved)
- The title of the document
- A resize control
- <span id="page-102-1"></span>■ A toolbar control  
These elements are shown in Figure 8-2.
