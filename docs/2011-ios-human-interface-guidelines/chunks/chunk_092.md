VoiceOver is designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, and for users with certain learning challenges.

To make sure VoiceOver users can use your app, you might need to supply some descriptive information about the views and controls in your user interface. Supporting VoiceOver does *not* require you to change the visual design of your UI in any way.  
When you use standard UI elements in a completely standard way, you have little (if any) additional work to do. The more custom your user interface is, the more custom information you need to provide so that VoiceOver can accurately describe your app.  
Making your iOS app accessible to VoiceOver users is the right thing to do. It can also increase your user base and it might help you address accessibility guidelines created by various governing bodies.
