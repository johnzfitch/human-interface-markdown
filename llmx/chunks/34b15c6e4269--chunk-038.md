Windows come up onto the screen in different ways as appropriate to the purpose of the window. The application controls at least the initial size and placement of its windows.  
A standard window has a close box. When the user clicks the close box, the window goes away. (In the Finder, this is animated—the window shrinks into the folder or icon from which it was opened.) If an application doesn't support closing a window with a close box, it shouldn't include a close box on the window.  
The application in control of the window determines what's done with the window visually and logically when the close box is clicked. To the user's eye, a window, once closed, can seem either to retreat into an icon or to simply disappear. In reality, either the information in the window may be saved (this is the usual case) and will still be there when the window is reopened, or the changes are not saved and the window is empty each time it's reopened.  
When closing a document, the user must be able to choose whether to save any changes made to the document since the last time it was saved.
