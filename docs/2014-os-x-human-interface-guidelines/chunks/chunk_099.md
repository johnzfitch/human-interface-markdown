A Choose dialog gives users a consistent way to select an item as the target of a task. An app can have more than one Choose dialog, but only one can be open at a time.  
#### A Choose dialog:  
- Can be opened by various commands
- Can support multiple selection
- Supports document preview
- Can be resized

**Note:** Recent Places doesn't record folders that users select in Choose dialogs.  
**Customize the Choose dialog title to reflect the task (if the dialog is not a sheet).** By default, the dialog's title is"Choose." If, for example, the command that displaysthe dialog is Choose Picture, title the dialog "Choose Picture." If it's helpful, also change the Choose button to something more specific.  
<span id="page-162-0"></span>**Considerincluding a pop-up menu that allows users to filterthe types of files that appearin the list.** Display items as dimmed that don't meet the filtering criteria. You can supplement this list with custom types and specify the default to show when the dialog opens. Include an All Applicable Files item, but it does not have to be the default.
