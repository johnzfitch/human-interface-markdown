Another instructive example of a Mac OS X application that was reimagined for iPhone OS is iPhoto. On the desktop, iPhoto supports comprehensive searching and organization, powerful editing capabilities, and creative printing options. When people use iPhoto on their desktop or laptop computers, they appreciate being able to see and organize their entire collection, make adjustments to photos, and manipulate them in various ways. Although the main focus of iPhoto is on the user's content, the application also offers extensive functionality in its window. Figure 1-8 shows the iPhoto user interface on the desktop.

But when they're mobile, people don't have time to edit their photos (and they don't expect to print them); instead, they want to be able to quickly see and share their photos.  
To meet this need on iPhone OS–based devices, Apple has provided the Photos application, which focuses on viewing photos and sharing them with others. The Photos user interface revolves around photos;so much so, in fact, that even parts of the device user interface can be hidden. When users choose to view a slideshow of their photos, the Photos application hides the navigation bar, toolbar, and even status bar, and displays translucent versions of these elements when users need to see them.  
Photos makes it easy for users to organize and find their photos by using a hierarchical arrangement: Users select an album, which contains a collection of photos, and then they select a single photo from the collection. In this way, Photos is an example of an application that combines features of the productivity style and the immersive style (to learn more about these styles, see "Three [Application](#page-17-1) Styles" (page 18)). Figure 1-9 shows how users can view photos in the Photos application.

<span id="page-28-1"></span>In addition, Photos uses a transient view, called an action sheet (described in "Alerts, Action [Sheets,](#page-78-0) and Modal [Views"](#page-78-0) (page 79)), to give users additional functionality without taking them out of the photo-viewing experience. Figure 1-10 shows how Photos provides options for using an individual photo.
