Throughout OS X, you can see quantities ofsmall, black imagesin toolbar controls, gradient buttons, and scope buttons. Some of the most familiar of these images, such as go back, set object view to icons, list, columns, or Cover Flow, view Action menu, view in Quick Look, and show path, and are shown here in the Finder toolbar.

In addition to these images, many OS X apps display full-colorstandard imagesin preferences window toolbars. For example, the toolbar in the Calendar preferences window contains the general, accounts, and advanced images.

The standard images of the first type (including, for example, the view in Quick Look symbol ) are known as template images. A **template image** is a black and clear image that can be used inside a control (such as a toolbar button). Template images are expected to receive additional processing,such as displaying an inverted variation. For a list of these images, see ["System-Provided](#page-320-0) Images for Use in Controls" (page 321); to learn more about toolbar buttons, see ["Window-Frame](#page-240-0) Controls" (page 241).  
Standard images of the second type (including, for example, the general preferences symbol ) can be used as standalone icon buttons in a preferences window's toolbar. Because these images are not template images, they cannot be used inside an app window's toolbar controls (or any other controls). For a list of these images, see ["System-Provided](#page-323-0) Images for Use as Toolbar Items" (page 324).  
OS X also provides a handful of standard images that can appear in the window body, such as the invalid data image . For a list of these images, see ["System-Provided](#page-322-0) Images for Use as Standalone Buttons" (page 323).  
Every system-provided image has a specific meaning that users know. To avoid confusing users, *it is essential that you use each image in accordance with its documented meaning and recommended usage* .  
When you use standard images correctly in your app, you also benefit from:  
- Shorter development time and less effort spent on creating custom images.
- Automatic updating of images if appearance changes occur in future operating system updates.  
To understand why it's important to use these images correctly, consider the following hypothetical example. Imagine that the "go forward" image (that is, ) is changed to look like a capital letter "F." If you correctly use this image in a control that performs a "go forward" action, the control still makes sense when it uses the new appearance. But if you incorrectly use the image to mean "play," your play control is suddenly nonsensical and confusing when it displays the "F."  
If you can't find a system-provided image that has the appropriate meaning for a specific purpose in your app, it's better to design your own than to misuse a system-provided image. To learn how to design icons, see ["Designing](#page-121-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 122).  
**Note:** Each image described in the following sections is listed with its constant name, as defined in the NSImage programming interface. However, the string value for each constant consists of the constant name without the "ImageName" portion. For example, the constant NSImageNameAddTemplate has "NSAddTemplate" as its string value. You might need to use the string value, rather than the constant name, to locate images by name in Interface Builder.
