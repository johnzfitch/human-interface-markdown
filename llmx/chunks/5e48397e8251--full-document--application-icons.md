## Application Icons

Because applications are usually used to create documents, the application icon uses a tilted document page to represent the documents the application creates. In this way, a relationship is established. The hand is also part of the default application icon. Figure 8-30 shows the default icon that appears in the Finder if you don't supply a custom icon for your application.

Although it's best to be consistent, if you must design an icon different from the default shape, be sure to use one of the standard application icon elements, either the page or the hand, in your icon. Figure 8-31 shows two custom application icons that use both the tilted document page and the hand elements.

You can customize the application icon by adding graphics to it. Use graphics that convey meaning about what your application does. If you can't think of elements that represent the overall function of your application, it's OK to use your company identification. However, using your logo is limiting because your company will probably make more than one application in its lifetime and you will want a distinct icon for each one.

Don't design an application icon that is completely unrelated to the basic shape of the application icon. People won't get the benefit of visual clues that help them identify your icon as an application. Figure 8-32 shows two examples of application icons that totally violate the guidelines presented here. They don't give the user much information about what they do, although they might be fun to look at.
