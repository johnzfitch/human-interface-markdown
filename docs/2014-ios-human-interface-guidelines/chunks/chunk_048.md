Feedback acknowledges people's actions, shows them the results, and updates them on the progress of their task.

The built-in iOS apps provide perceptible feedback in response to every user action. List items and controls highlight briefly when people tap them and—during operations that last more than a few seconds—a control shows elapsing progress.  
Subtle animation can give people meaningful feedback that helps clarify the results of their actions. For example, lists can animate the addition of a new row to help people track the change visually.  
<span id="page-69-1"></span>Sound can also give people useful feedback, but it shouldn't be the only feedback mechanism because people can't always hear their devices.
