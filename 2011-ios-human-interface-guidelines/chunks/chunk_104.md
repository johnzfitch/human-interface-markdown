A navigation bar appears at the upper edge of an application screen, just below the status bar. A navigation bar usually displaysthe title of the currentscreen or view, centered along itslength. When navigating through a hierarchy of information, users tap the back button to the left of the title to return to the previous screen. Otherwise, users can tap content-specific controlsin the navigation bar to manage the contents of the screen.  
All controls in a navigation bar include a bezel around them, which, in iOS, is the bordered style. If you place a plain (borderless) control in a navigation bar, it automatically converts to the bordered style.  
On iPhone, changing the device orientation from portrait to landscape can change the height of the navigation bar automatically. On iPad, the height and translucency of a navigation bar does not change with rotation.  
On iPhone, a navigation bar always displays across the full width of the screen. On iPad, a navigation bar can display within a view, such as one pane of a split view, that does not extend across the screen.
