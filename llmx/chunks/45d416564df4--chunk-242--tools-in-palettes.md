#### Tools in Palettes  
It's a good idea to name tools in palettes, because the name can help the user figure out what the tool is for. After naming the tool, describe one or two likely ways to use it. Don't describe every shortcut or trick you can do with the modifier keys. Figure 11-15 shows one example of a help balloon for a tool in a palette.
