The Clipboard holds whatever data is cut or copied from a document. It stores the contents until the user replaces them with a new cut or copy operation. The user can change documents, applications, or open a utility without losing the Clipboard contents. Because the contents of the Clipboard don't change when the user moves from one application to another, the Clipboard is used to transfer data among compatible applications and desk accessories. If the user moves the Clipboard file from one disk to another, the contents move with it, replacing any existing Clipboard file on the target disk.

![](images/_page_135_Picture_4.jpeg)  
The Clipboard is available to all applications. Your application can show the contents of the Clipboard in a window. The Clipboard window looks and acts like a document window. The contents are visible, but not editable.  
Every time the user selects data in the active document and chooses Cut or Copy, store a copy of the selection in the Clipboard, replacing any previous Clipboard contents. Keep the previous contents available in case the user chooses Undo.  
Implement the Show Clipboard/Hide Clipboard command in the Edit menu so that the user can display and close the Clipboard window. If the Clipboard is already showing, the user can also use the close box or the Close command to close the window. Show Clipboard and Hide Clipboard are a single toggled item. The Show Clipboard/Hide Clipboard command is described in"Show Clipboard/Hide Clipboard" on page 117.  
You should let the user determine when the Clipboard window is open. For example, if the user leaves the window open when quitting your application, the Clipboard should be open when the user restarts it.  
In the cooperative, multitasking environment of the current system software, it's important that you hide your application's Clipboard window when your application is not active. In this model, each application has a local Clipboard. Whenever the user switches applications, the contents of the Clipboard are converted to a standard format.  
#### <span id="page-136-0"></span>Undo/Redo 4  
The Undo command reverses the effect of the user's previous operation. The Redo command reverses the effect of the last Undo command. Undo and Redo are a single toggled item. In most applications, there is one level of undo operations. The application determines which operations can be undone. Simple operations require your application to store a minimal amount of information about the previous state of the data in order to implement the Undo command. For example, if a user cuts one word from a document, you only need to store the size, the location, the content, and the style of the data. For operations that require you to store the entire state of the document in order to implement the Undo command, it may be more difficult to implement. You should consider the needs of your audience when making difficult decisions about which operations support the Undo command. Remember that your application must be able to redo every undo operation.  
In general, support the Undo command for operations that *change the user's contents* of a document. It's nice, but not necessary, to support the Undo command for operations that *don't change the user's contents* of a document. Actions that take a lot of effort to recreate are probably those that a user would most expect to be able to undo. For example, a user might spend several minutes arranging windows on a screen in a specific layout. If that user then accidentally chose the Tile command, the user would expect to be able to recover the original layout by using the Undo command.  
Most menu items, regardless of how the user invokes them, should be undoable. Most keyboard input, any sequence of characters typed from the keyboard or numeric keypad, including Delete (Backspace), Return, and Tab should also be undoable.  
Operations that may not be undoable include selecting, scrolling, splitting the window, or changing a window's size or location. None of these operations interrupts a typing sequence. For example, if the user types a few characters and then scrolls the document, the Undo operation doesn't undo the scrolling but does undo the typing. Whenever the location affected by the Undo command isn't currently showing on the screen, your application should scroll the document so the user can see the effect of the Undo command.  
You should add the name of the last operation to the Undo command. For example, it could read Undo Typing if the user just finished entering some text in a document. If the last operation can't be undone, you should use the phrase Can't Undo and display it dimmed, because it provides more feedback to the user about the current state. The Undo command changes to Redo after the user chooses Undo. You should also include the operation name in the Redo string when possible. If the user chooses Redo, reverse the undo operation.

If a user is about to complete an operation that could have a deleterious effect on data and that can't be undone, you should warn the user. For example, if a user is about to destroy a lot of data by replacing every fifth word with a space, display an alert box that says something to the effect of, "You are about to change a lot of your document. You can't undo this operation." The buttons should be labeled Replace and Cancel. If the user is about to make a change that affects only the environment, such as changing a window location, then it's not necessary to display a warning.  
The Command-Z combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Undo/Redo command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.  
#### Cut 4  
The Cut command removes data that the user selects prior to choosing the command. People use the Cut command to delete the current selection or to move it. Store the cut selection on the Clipboard, replacing its previous contents.  
<span id="page-138-0"></span>Make the area active where the cut selection was. The visual indicators vary by application type. For example, a word processor would display a blinking insertion point at the spot where the text was cut. In an array, the user would see an empty but highlighted cell. If the user chooses Paste immediately after choosing Cut, restore the document to the state it was in just before the cut operation.  
The Command-X combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Cut command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
