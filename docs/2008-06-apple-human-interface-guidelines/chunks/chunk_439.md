Use a list view when you need to display items along with various attributes of each item. If you need to display a list of items, but you don't need to display any additional attributes, you might want to use a scrolling list instead (see ["Scrolling](#page-318-0) Lists" (page 319) for more information about scrolling lists). Using a list view, you can create a column for each attribute you need to display.  
Sort the rows in the list view by the selected column heading. You can implement sorting on secondary attributes behind the scenes, but the user should see only one column selected at a time. If a user clicks an already selected column heading, change the direction of the sort.  
Items may be editable depending on the purpose of your application. In the Finder, for example, items in the Name column (the leftmost column) are editable when in list view, but nothing else is.
