A **sheet** is a modal dialog attached to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog applies to. The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window helps users take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model (see ["Window Layering" \(page 70\)\)](#page-69-0). Sheets also allow users to perform other tasks before dismissing the dialog, so there's no longer the sense of the system being "hijacked" by the application.  
<span id="page-95-2"></span>You lay out sheets like any other dialog in Mac OS X. Carbon developers are responsible for creating, showing, handling the events for, and closing sheets. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when it appears, is handled automatically by the Window Manager. Cocoa developers are responsible for loading, showing, and closing sheets. While a sheet it displayed, events are handled by the Application Kit just as for any other window. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when it appears and is dismissed, is handled automatically by the Application Kit.
