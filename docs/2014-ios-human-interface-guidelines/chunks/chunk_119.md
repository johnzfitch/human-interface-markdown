A **Detail Disclosure button** reveals additional details or functionality related to an item.

**API Note:** To learn how to define a Detail Disclosure button in your code, see *UITableViewCell Class Reference* and "Buttons".  
A Detail Disclosure button reveals a separate view that contains additional information or functionality related to a specific item.  
When a Detail Disclosure button appears in a table row, tapping elsewhere in the row doesn't activate the Detail Disclosure button; instead, it selects the row item or results in app-defined behavior.  
Typically, you use a Detail Disclosure button in a table view to give users a way to see more details or functionality related to a list item. However, you can also use this element in other types of views to give users a way to see more information or functionality related to an item in that view.
