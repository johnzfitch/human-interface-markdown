## Pressing

Pressing means holding down the mouse button for a time while the mouse remains stationary. For example, pressing a menu title displays the menu contents. For certain kinds of objects, pressing on the object has the same effect as clicking it repeatedly. For example, clicking a scroll arrow causes a document to scroll one line; pressing a scroll arrow causes the document to scroll continuously until the user releases the mouse button or reaches the end of the document. Figure 10-6 shows the effect of pressing the mouse button while the pointer is on a scroll arrow.
