A window is a frame for viewing something, as determined by the application. For example, each MacWrite window provides a view into a written document. To provide a *common* framework for the many kinds of information that users interact with, windows are highly standardized.  
Because more than one window can be viewed at once, users can arrange things the way they like and do things between windows. Because windows can overlap, users can "set aside" information yet still have ready access to it.  
Manipulating windows—moving them, overlapping them, resizing them—does not affect the contents of the windows, only the user's view of it. Again, this lets users tailor their work environment without fundamentally changing the elements in this environment until they're ready to.
