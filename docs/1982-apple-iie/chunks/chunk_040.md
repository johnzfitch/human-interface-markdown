Inverse. There are many recent model home color TVs and older black and white TV's that display inverse mode very poorly. Inverse mode can be used effectively to accent screen material, particularly on the limited 40 column screen of the Apple II and II Plus. It should be used creatively in business software where it is expected the user will have a quality monitor. However, for software aimed for the home market, avoid inverse mode unless the entire screen or several adjacent lines are simultaneously inversed.  
Flashing mode should only be used to indicate imminent destruction of data or the program.  
Focus. TV sets in particular, as well as many lower-priced monitors, have very poor focus in the extreme corners. Use the corners for familiar character groupings (such as words), rather than clusters of unrelated characters (such as numbers). The human mind can figure out that what looks like "8ASIC FUNCTIONS" is probably "BASIC FUNCTIONS", but will have less luck discerning that what looks like "1500.00" is really "7500.00", an error that could have far-reaching effects. Keep input lines away from the corners for the same reason: the user needs to be able to check each individual character typed.
