To create an icon button in Interface Builder, drag a bevel button or a square button into your window, add your icon, and deselect the Bordered checkbox in the Attributes pane of the inspector. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the setBezelStyle method of NSButtonCell with NSShadowlessSquareBezelStyle as the argument.  
<span id="page-262-0"></span>You can also use Interface Builder to create an icon button that includes a pop-up menu. First, drag a pop-up button into your window then, in the Attributes pane of the inspector, change the type to Pull Down. Finally, in the same pane, change the style to either Bevel or Square (it doesn't matter which) and deselect the Bordered checkbox.
