#### **cursor** See **pointer.**  
**database** (1) A collection of information organized in a form that can be readily manipulated and sorted by a computer user. (2) Short for *database management system*.  
**default** A value, action, or setting that a computer system assumes unless the user gives an explicit instruction to the contrary.  
**default button** In an alert box or a modal dialog box, the button whose effect occurs if the user presses Return or Enter. In an alert box, it's boldly outlined; in a modal dialog box, it's boldly outlined or it's the OK button.  
**delete** To remove something, such as a character or word from a file, or a file from a disk. Keys such as the Delete key and the Backspace key can remove one character at a time by moving to the left (in languages that read from left to right). The Cut command removes selected text and places it on the Clipboard; the Clear command removes selected text without placing it on the Clipboard. (The Undo command can reverse the action of Clear and of the Delete or Backspace key if it is used immediately.)  
**Delete key** A key that moves the insertion point backward, removing the previously typed character, or that removes the current selection. Its function is identical to that of the Backspace key on the original Macintosh keyboards. Compare **Forward Delete key.**  
**desk accessory** A small application that provides a specific, limited capability for a particular task, for example, the Calculator, the Note Pad, and Key Caps. In versions of system software earlier than System 7, desk accessories were always in the Apple menu. In System 7, a desk accessory can be in the Apple menu or anywhere in the file system. From the user's point of view, there is little distinction between desk accessories and applications.  
**desktop** The working environment on the computer—the background on which icons and windows are displayed (minus the menu bar).
