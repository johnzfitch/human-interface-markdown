<span id="page-175-1"></span>Document windows include a **proxy icon** in the title bar after a document is saved for the first time. After pressing a proxy icon for a brief period, users can manipulate it as if they were manipulating the corresponding file-system object. For example, you can attach a document to an email message by dragging its proxy icon into the email message.

<span id="page-176-2"></span>A proxy icon appears in its normal state as long as the state of the document and the file-system object are the same. When a document has unsaved changes, its proxy icon appears dimmed. Note the difference between the proxy icon in the document with unsaved changes versus the document with saved changes in Figure 13-6.

<span id="page-176-1"></span>Command-clicking the title or the proxy icon displays a pop-up menu illustrating the document path. As shown in [Figure 13-7](#page-176-1) (page 177), the document path displays the document itself and all containing folders up to the volume that contains the user's home directory. Because Mac OS X is a multiple-user environment, it's especially important to show the complete path of a document to avoid confusion.
