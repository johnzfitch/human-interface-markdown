<span id="page-37-4"></span>People with a visual disability have the most trouble with the display (the screen). Some users need high contrast. Software that can handle different text sizes can make it easier to support people with a visual disability. Mac OS X (version 10.2 and later) provides an onscreen zooming option in Universal Access preferences. Following the layout guidelines can help users with low vision as well.  
Color-vision deficiencies are problematic for some people. Don't create interfaces that use only color coding to convey important information. Color coding should always be redundant to other types of cues, such as text, position, or highlighting. If you allow users to select from a variety of colors to convey information, they can choose colors appropriate for their needs.
