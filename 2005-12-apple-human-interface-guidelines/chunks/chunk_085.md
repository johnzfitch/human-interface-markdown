When you've decided on the widget's task, follow these guidelines for designing the user interface:  
- Use color to enhance the visual impact of your widgets.
- Widgets should be visually stimulating, and good color choices can help convey the type of task the widget performs. As with application icons (described in ["Icon Genres and Families"](#page-124-1)(page 125)), you should consider using bright, saturated colors for fun, creative tasks and more sombre, desaturated colors for utilitarian tasks
- Don't use Aqua controls on the front of your widget. Instead, design controls that support and enhance the task-oriented appearance of the widget.
- Display the widget's information at once. Dashboard appears and disappears quickly, so you don't want to make the user wait for your content to display.
- The default size of the widget should be small, but it should be able to expand if the task requires it.
- Be aware that a user might want to populate the Dashboard with a very large number of widgets. If your widget is too large and seems to monopolize the screen, a user might choose not to include it.
- If appropriate you can provide a resize control, but recognize that if a user misses this control and clicks outside the widget, Dashboard is hidden.
- The default set of information your widget displays should be minimal and should not require scrolling.
- If, however, the widget's function is to provide a lot of information, consider making the presence of a scroll bar an option the user can select.
- Use clearly readable fonts.
- Avoid sacrificing readability to achieve a particular appearance. Focus on building the widget's personality into the contours and the controls you design.
- If appropriate, provide a way for the user to set a few options on the back of the widget (to do this, display an Info button in the lower right quadrant of the widget; see *Dashboard Tutorial* for more information).
- Use a more subdued version of your color scheme on the back of the widget. This helps the user distinguish the widget's back from its front.  
Using Mac OS X Technologies  
Provide a Done button on the back of your widget that allows users to return to the front of the widget (for more information on how to provide this control, see *Dashboard Tutorial*).
