### WINDOWS

Windows are the rectangles on the desktop that display information. The most common types of windows are document windows, desk accessories, dialog boxes, and alert boxes. (Dialog and alert boxes are discussed under "Dialogs and Alerts".) Some of the features described in this section are applicable only to document windows. Figure 11 shows a typical active window and some of its components.
