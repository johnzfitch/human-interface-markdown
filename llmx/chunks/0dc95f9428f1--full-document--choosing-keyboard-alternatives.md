## **Choosing Keyboard Alternatives**

Initially, until the user specifies a different preference, applications should follow the guidelines for keyboard alternatives described in this section. Users can use the Preferences application to alter the keyboard alternatives for every application at once. You're also encouraged to let the user choose and change keyboard alternatives using your application's Preferences panel.

The guidelines place keyboard alternatives into three groups-reserved, required, and recommended. These groups are listed in the tables that follow along with the commands they perform and the menus where the commands are located. (See "Standard Menus and Commands" in Chapter 6 for more information on the listed commands and menus.)
