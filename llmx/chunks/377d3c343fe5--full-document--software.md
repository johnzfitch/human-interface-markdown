## Software

Most of the software guidelines pertain to four new features of the Apple IIe:

- 1. The new RESET features and their implications.
- 2. The Apple IIe 80-column text cards and the need to check for the presence of such a card and turn it on and off at appropriate times.
- 3. The OPEN-APPLE and SOLID-APPLE keys and the fact that they are electrically connected to the pushbuttons of hand controls #0 and #1, respectively.
- The new firmware, including enhanced Monitor program functions, expanded keyboard ROM map with lowercase characters, and twofold video display ROM map for primary and alternate character set display.
