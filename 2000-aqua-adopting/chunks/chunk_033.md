System font is used for message text, or the main text, in all dialogs. It is also the default font for lists and tables. Interface Builder shows a message text string in the Views Palette.  
Small system font is used for informative text, as described in ["Designing Alerts"](#page-10-1)  [\(page 11\).](#page-10-1) This is the default font for headers in lists and for Help Tags. You can also use it to provide additional information about settings in various windows, such as the QuickTime pane in System Preferences. Interface Builder shows an informative text string in the Views Palette.  
Label font is used for labels with controls such as sliders and icon bevel buttons. You should rarely need to use this font in dialogs. For an example of this font, see the Speech pane in System Preferences.  
Use emphasized system font sparingly. You might choose to use it to title a group of settings that appear without a group box. For an example of this font, see the Date or Numbers section of the International pane in System Preferences.
