## **Graphical Devices in Menu Commands**

The area to the right of a command can be used only to display a keyboard alternative or a submenu symbol. (Commands that control submenus can't have keyboard alternatives.) No other graphical devices are permitted in this area.

In addition, menu commands should not use arbitrary graphical devices, such as check marks, to show state. There's almost always a more appropriate way to display current state in our interface-for example, by using buttons or check boxes in a panel or by designing objects that can be directly manipulated (such as those in the Edit application's ruler).
