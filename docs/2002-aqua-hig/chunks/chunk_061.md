To help users identify the active application, the application menu title is in boldface.  
In order to fit within the allotted menu bar space, the application menu title should be one word, if possible, and a maximum of 16 characters (128 pixels wide in 14-point Lucida Grande Bold). If the application name is too long, provide a short name (16 characters or fewer) as part of the application package. The Hide, Quit, and About items should also use the short application name.  
If you don't provide a short name, the application name is truncated from the end (and an ellipsis is added), if necessary. For more information about how to provide a short application name, see *Inside Mac OS X: System Overview,* available at the Mac OS X developer documentation website.
