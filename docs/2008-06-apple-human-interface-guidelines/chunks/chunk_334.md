Bevel buttons are very versatile and can display text, icons, or other images. Bevel buttons can also display a single downward-pointing arrow in addition to text or an image, which indicates the presence of a pop-up menu. See "Icon Buttons and Bevel [Buttons](#page-278-0) with Pop-Up Menus" (page 279) for more information about this usage.  
If you choose to display an icon or image instead of a text label, be sure the meaning of the image is clear and unambiguous (see ["Cultural](#page-46-2) Values" (page 47) for some advice on choosing appropriate imagery). Interface Builder provides several built-in images you can use on a bevel button; see ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) [Images"](#page-150-0) (page 151) for more information about system-provided images.  
You can also combine an icon (or image) and a text label on a bevel button. You can place the text anywhere on the button in relation to the icon (you specify the location in Interface Builder or programmatically). Use label font (10-point Lucida Grande Regular) for text labels.  
If you use a bevel button as a push button, its label should be a verb or verb phrase that describes the action it performs. If you provide a set of bevel buttons to be used as radio buttons or checkboxes, you might label each with a noun that describes a setting or a value.
