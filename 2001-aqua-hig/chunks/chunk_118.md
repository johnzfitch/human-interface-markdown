A Choose dialog enables the user to select an item as the target of a customized task. For example, when a user attempts to open a broken alias, the Fix Alias dialog lets the user choose another item for the alias to open. An application can have more than one Choose dialog, but only one can be open at a time. In some situations, it may be appropriate for a Choose dialog to be a sheet.
