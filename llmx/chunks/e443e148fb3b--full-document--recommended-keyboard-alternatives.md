## **Recommended Keyboard Alternatives**

These keyboard alternatives must be used for a command if the command has a keyboard alternative. If not, the key can be used for some other command. For example, if the Copy Ruler command has no keyboard alternative, Command-l can be used as a keyboard alternative for another command.
