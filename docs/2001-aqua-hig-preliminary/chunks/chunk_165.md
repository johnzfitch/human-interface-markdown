Make labels for interface elements easy to understand and in the user's language. Try to be as specific as possible in any element that requires the user to make a choice, such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and push buttons. It's important to be concise, but don't sacrifice clarity for space.  
#### <span id="page-180-4"></span><span id="page-180-2"></span><span id="page-180-0"></span>Capitalization of Interface Elements  
**Title style** means that you capitalize every word except  
- articles (*a, an, the*)
- coordinating conjunctions (*an, or*)
- prepositions of three or fewer letters, except when the preposition is part of a verb phrase, as in Log Out.  
In title style, always capitalize the first and last word, even if it is an article, a conjunction, or a preposition of three or fewer letters.  
<span id="page-180-3"></span>**Sentence style** means that the first letter of the first word is capitalized, and the rest of the words are lowercase, unless they are proper nouns or proper adjectives. Use periods in dialogs only after complete sentences.
