A **progress indicator** informs users about the status of a lengthy operation.  
**Important:** The controls described in this section are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the window-frame areas. See Some [Controls](#page-176-1) Can Be Used on the Window Frame (page 177) for controls designed specifically for use in the toolbar (and bottom bar).  
**Put progress indicators in consistentlocations.** For example, the Mail app displaysthe asynchronous progress indicator in the right end of the To field asit finds and displays email addressesthat match what the user types. Choosing a consistent location for a progress indicator allows users to quickly check a familiar place for the status of an operation. For more information on the importance of providing consistency in your app, see [Consistency](#page-63-1) (page 64).  
There are three types of progress indicators, each of which is suitable for a specific situation:  
- Determinate progress bar
- Indeterminate progress bar
- <span id="page-205-2"></span>● Asynchronous progress indicator  
#### Determinate Progress Bar  
A **determinate progress bar** provides feedback on a process with a known duration.  
**API Note:** To define a determinate progress bar in your code, use the NSProgressIndicator class with style NSProgressIndicatorBarStyle.  
In a determinate progress bar, the "fill" movesfrom left to right. The fill is provided automatically (you determine the minimum and maximum values that should be represented).  
Users generally expect a determinate progress bar to disappear as soon as the fill completes.  
Use a determinate progress bar when the full length of an operation can be determined and you want to tell the user how much of the process has been completed. For example, you could use a determinate progress bar to show the progress of a file conversion.  
**Ensure that a determinate progress bar accurately associates progress with time.** A progress bar that becomes 90 percent complete in 5 seconds but takes 5 minutes for the remaining 10 percent, for example, would be annoying and lead users to think that something is wrong.  
**Be sure to allow the fill to complete before dismissing the progress bar.** If you dismiss the progress bar too soon, users are likely to wonder if the process really finished.  
**Allow users to interrupt or stop the process, if appropriate.** If the process being performed can be interrupted, the progress dialog should contain a Cancel button (and support the Esc key). If interrupting the process will result in possible side effects, the button should say Stop instead of Cancel. To learn more about dialogs in general,see [Dialogs](#page-150-0) (page 151). To supply a Cancel button, you use a push button (for more information about this control, see Push [Button](#page-178-1) (page 179)). To supply a Stop control, you can use the standalone version of the stop progress image (to learn more about this system-provided image, see [System-Provided](#page-331-0) Images for Use as [Standalone](#page-331-0) Buttons (page 332)).  
<span id="page-206-0"></span>**If appropriate, provide a label for a determinate progress bar in a dialog.** You can do this so that users understand the context in which the processis occurring. Such a labelshould have sentence-style capitalization. For more information on this style, see [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) Labels and Text (page 47).  
#### Indeterminate Progress Bar  
An **indeterminate progress bar** provides feedback on a process of unknown duration.  
**API Note:** To define an indeterminate progress bar in your code, use the NSProgressIndicator class with style NSProgressIndicatorBarStyle.  
An indeterminate progress bar displays a spinning striped fill that indicates an ongoing process. OS X provides this appearance automatically.  
Use an indeterminate progress bar when the duration of a process can't be determined.  
**Switch to a determinate progress bar when appropriate.** If an indeterminate process reaches a point where its duration can be determined, switch to a determinate progress bar. For more on determinate progress bars, see [Determinate](#page-205-2) Progress Bar (page 206).  
**In general, use an indeterminate progress bar in a dialog or window that focuses on the process.** For example, you might display an indeterminate progress bar in a dialog that focuses on the opening of the file. This usage helps users understand which process is ongoing.  
**Allow users to interrupt or stop the process, if appropriate.** If the process being performed can be interrupted, the progress dialog should contain a Cancel button (and support the Esc key). If interrupting the process will result in possible side effects, the button should say Stop instead of Cancel. To learn more about dialogs in general,see [Dialogs](#page-150-0) (page 151). To supply a Cancel button, you use a push button (for more information about this control, see Push [Button](#page-178-1) (page 179)). To supply a Stop control, you can use the standalone version of the stop progress image. To learn more about this system-provided image, see [System-Provided](#page-331-0) Images for Use as [Standalone](#page-331-0) Buttons (page 332).  
**If appropriate, provide a label for an indeterminate progress bar in a dialog.** You can do this so that users know what processis occurring. Such a labelshould have sentence-style capitalization (described in [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) [Labels](#page-46-0) and Text (page 47)). Also, you can end the label with an ellipsis (...) to emphasize the ongoing nature of the processing.  
**Consider using an asynchronous progress indicator, instead of an indeterminate progress bar, in some cases.** If, for example, you need to provide an indication of an indeterminate process that's associated with a part of a window, such as a control, or if space is limited, you might want to use an asynchronous progress indicator instead. For more information on asynchronous progress indicators, see Asynchronous Progress Indicator.  
#### <span id="page-207-0"></span>Asynchronous Progress Indicator  
An **asynchronous progress indicator** provides feedback on an ongoing process.  
![](images/_page_207_Picture_7.jpeg)  
**API Note:** To define an asynchronous progress indicator in your code, use the NSProgressIndicator class with style NSProgressIndicatorSpinningStyle.  
The appearance of the asynchronous progress indicator is provided automatically. The asynchronous progress indicator always spins at the same rate.  
Use an asynchronous progressindicator when space is very constrained,such asin a text field or near a control. Because this indicator is small and unobtrusive, it is especially useful for asynchronous events that take place in the background, such as retrieving messages from a server.  
#### **If the process might change from indeterminate to determinate, start with an indeterminate progress bar.**  
You don't want to start with an asynchronous progress indicator because the determinate progress bar is a different shape and takes up much more space. Similarly, if the process might change from indeterminate to determinate, use an indeterminate progress bar instead of an asynchronous progress indicator, because it is the same shape and size as the determinate progress bar.  
**In general, avoid supplying a label.** Because an asynchronous progress indicator typically appears when the user initiates a process, a label is not usually necessary. If you decide to provide a label that appears with the indicator, create a complete or partial sentence that briefly describes the process that is occurring. You should use sentence-style capitalization (described in [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) Labels and Text (page 47)) and you can end the label with an ellipsis (...) to emphasize the ongoing nature of the processing.
