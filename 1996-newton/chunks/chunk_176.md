The Newton system provides a Find service with which a user can search participating applications for text, dates, or other types of data. A user specifies what to find in a Find slip that may be supplied by the system, customized by an application developer, or supplied entirely by the developer. The Find slip appears when a user taps the Find button, which is a picture button that looks like a magnifying glass. [Figure 8-5](#page-248-0) illustrates the Find button and the Find slip that the system supplies.

The standard Find slip contains a labeled input line used to specify a search criterion and several radio buttons used to specify the scope of the search. The labeled input line has a picker for specifying the kind of search to perform—a text item or a date. Your application can also implement specialized searches for other kinds of data; these searches are described in more detail later in this section. Figure 8-6 illustrates the standard Look For picker.
