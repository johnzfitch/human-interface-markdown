A **color well** is a small rectangular control that indicates the current color for a particular setting and, when clicked, displays the Colorswindow(usingthe Colorswindow, users can change a color setting). For example, the Graphic pane of the Pages inspector contains three color wells that allow users to change the color of an object's fill, outline, and shadow, as shown in Figure 15-40.
