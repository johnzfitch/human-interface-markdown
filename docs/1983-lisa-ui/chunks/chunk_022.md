The Desktop Manager suspends a document that is open or set aside in the following cases:  
- 1) The user turns the power off on the Lisa.
- 2) The user ejects a diskette that contains the application, part of the document, or both.  
If the document is open or has been set aside, then its current state is frozen. When the user subsequently reopens it, it should appear exactly the same as before. If the user has saved and put away the document, a suspend should have no effect.
