<span id="page-115-4"></span>Whenever your application displays a window, you must decide where to put it and how big to make it.  
<span id="page-115-5"></span>New document windows should open horizontally centered and should display as much of the document content as possible. The top of the document window should butt up against the menu bar (or the application's toolbar, if one is open and positioned below the menu bar). Subsequent windows should open to the right 20 pixels and down 20 pixels. Make sure that no part of a new window overlaps with the Dock. (See *Apple Software Design Guidelines*.)  
For nondocument windows, the preference is to open new windows horizontally centered as shown in Figure 8-17. The vertical position should be visually centered: The distance from the bottom of the window to the top of the Dock (if it's at the bottom of the screen) should be  
<span id="page-116-1"></span>approximately twice the distance as that from the bottom of the menu bar to the top of the window. Subsequent windows are moved to the right 20 pixels and down 20 pixels. Make sure that no part of a new window overlaps with the Dock.

If a user changes a window's initial size or location, maintain the user's choices the next time the associated file or window (in the case of a single-window application) opens. If a user opens, moves, and closes a document window without making any other changes, save the new window position but don't modify the file's date stamp.  
Before reopening a window, make sure that the size and state are feasible for the user's current monitor setup, which may not be the same as the last time the document was open. Try to maintain the window's previous location (the top-left corner of the window) and, if possible, its size. If you can't replicate both, maintain the location and reduce the window's size. If that is not possible, try to keep the window on the same monitor, open the window so that as much of the content as necessary is visible, and follow the guidelines for opening a new window, as described previously.  
Window Behavior **117**  
<span id="page-117-2"></span>For example, if a user opens a document to full size on a wide aspect-ratio display and then opens the file on a computer with a smaller display, the document should open in a window sized for the smaller display, not in the larger, saved size. For more information on appropriate window size, see ["Resizing and Zooming Windows"](#page-118-0) (page 119).  
<span id="page-117-4"></span>On a computer with more than one display, display the first new window visually centered in the screen containing the menu bar. If the user doesn't move that first window, display each additional window below and to the right of its predecessor. If the user moves the window, display each additional window on the screen that contains the largest portion of the frontmost window, as shown in Figure 8-18. For example, if the user creates a window, drags it completely to a second monitor, and then creates a new window, display the new window on the second screen. If there is sufficient room on the screen, display subsequent windows to the lower right of the frontmost window. If there isn't enough room on the screen, display subsequent windows starting in the original visually centered position, and then continue to display additional windows slightly offset to the lower right.  
<span id="page-117-1"></span>If the user moves a window so that it is entirely positioned on a second monitor and then opens the window on a single-monitor system, respect the window's previous size, if possible.

<span id="page-117-3"></span><span id="page-117-0"></span>If the user opens several windows on a multiple-monitor system, continue to place the windows on the screen where the user is working, each new one below and to the right of its predecessor. Don't open a window so that it spans monitors; the *initial position* of a window should always be contained on a single screen.
