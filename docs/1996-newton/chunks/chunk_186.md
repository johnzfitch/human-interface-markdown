If a view has a Filing button (for filing the view's data into folders), then the view must also have a folder tab at the top so users can see the data they have filed in folders. A folder tab looks like the cut tab part of a paper file folder. The Newton folder tab shows the name of the folder whose data is currently displayed in the view. The name begins with a diamond because tapping it pops up a picker from which a user can choose which folder to see. Additionally, a user can choose to see only items not filed in any folder or items from all folders (including unfiled items). A check mark appears next to the current choice. [Figure 8-18](#page-261-0) shows a sample folder tab and picker.  
Every Folder picker includes two choices in addition to the alphabetical list of folders. At the top of the Folder picker, above a separator line, is the choice Unfiled Items. At the bottom of the alphabetical list of folders, below a separator line, is the choice All Items. In both of these choices, your application can replace the word Items with the name of the type of item displayed in the view.

At the bottom of a Folder picker, below a solid separator line, your application can have the system list available storage locations. This allows a user to specify a storage location in addition to a folder from which to display items. The system does not list storage locations in a Folder picker unless the Newton has more than one storage location. Figure 8-19 shows an example of a Folder picker with storage locations listed at the bottom.

<span id="page-262-0"></span>A variation on the plain folder tab includes a digital clock and calendar that a user can tap to display the built-in Clock application. Figure 8-20 illustrates a folder tab with clock calendar.

Instead of a digital clock and calendar, your application can display a view title in the black area of a folder tab, as shown in Figure 8-21.
