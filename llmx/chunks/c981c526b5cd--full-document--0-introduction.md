# #0. Introduction

By: Katie Withey Date: 31 March 87

The Apple Human Interface Group is now publishing Human Interface Technical Notes. These notes cover human interface issues and design guidelines. This first batch contains information that will be integrated into the final published versions of Human Interface Guidelines: the Apple Desktop Interface and Inside Macintosh, volume V (both of which will be published by Addison Wesley and available through APDA at some time in the future). Human Interface Technical Notes will be published on a now-and-then basis.

This release of notes contains:
