Keyboard shortcuts can provide an easy way forsophisticated usersto perform actions, but they're not required. If you can't find a unique and easy-to-use keyboard shortcut for a command, don't use one at all; keep in mind that users may have difficulty pressing multiple modifier keys anyway.  
**Important:** Alwaysrespect the system-reserved keyboard shortcutsin your app so that users aren't confused when the shortcuts they know work differently in your app.
