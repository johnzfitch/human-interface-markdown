## Design Online Help as an Interactive Coach

As a method for communication, computers provide opportunities that books can't provide. The full benefits of online help appear when a help system can interact with a user and make use of the context in which the user is working. Where appropriate, a help system can also play sounds, run animations, and play movies. Rather than producing an online document, a help system should bring relevant information to users when they need it and guide them through the interface just as a human teacher would. Your help system needs to assist users with a problem as efficiently as possible without requiring the users to study a topic in depth.
