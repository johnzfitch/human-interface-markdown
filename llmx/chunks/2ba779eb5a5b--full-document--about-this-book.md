# About This Book

*Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines* describes the way to create products that optimize the interaction between people and Macintosh computers. It explains the whys and hows of the Macintosh interface in general terms and specific details.

*Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines* helps you link the philosophy behind the Macintosh interface to the actual implementation of interface elements. Examples from a wide range of Macintosh products show good human interface design, including individual and iterative examples. These examples are accompanied by descriptions and discussions of why to follow the guidelines. This book also contains examples of how *not* to do human interface design; they are marked as such and appear with a discussion that points out what's inappropriate and how to correct it.
