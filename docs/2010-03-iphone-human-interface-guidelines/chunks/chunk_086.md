Although a full-screen, immersive application can hide the status bar, you should carefully consider the ramifications of this design decision. People expect to be able to see the current battery charge of their devices; hiding this information, and requiring users to quit your application to get it, is not an ideal user experience.  
For example, Photos displays individual photos from a camera roll in a full-screen view that fades out the status bar, navigation bar, and toolbar after a few seconds. This is appropriate because in Photos, users focus on viewing the content, not interacting with it. However, users can bring back the status bar, navigation bar, and toolbar with a single tap on the screen.  
If you sometimes hide the status bar in your application, you should take advantage of users' experience of this behavior and allow them to redisplay it with a single tap. Unless you have a very compelling reason to do so, it's best to avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or remember it.  
Although you have little control over the contents of the status bar, you can customize its appearance and, to some extent, its behavior. Specifically, you can:  
- Indicate whether the network activity indicatorshould be visible. You should display the network activity indicator if your application is performing a network operation that will take more than a couple of seconds. If the operation will finish sooner than that, you don't have to show the network activity indicator, because it would be likely to disappear before users notice its presence. (In your code, you use the UIApplication method networkActivityIndicatorVisible to control the indicator's visibility.)
- Specify the color of the status bar. You can choose gray (the default color), opaque black, or translucent black (that is, black with an alpha value of 0.5). Figure 6-2 shows these styles. (Note that you set a value in your Info.plist file to specify the status bar style; see *iPhone Application Programming Guide* for more information on how to do this.)
- <span id="page-67-1"></span>■ Set whether the change from the current status bar color to the new color should be animated. (Note that the animation causes the old status bar to slide up until it disappears off the screen, while the new status bar slides into place.)
