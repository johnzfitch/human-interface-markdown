#### Extending a Selection

A user can change the extent of an existing selection by holding down the Shift key and clicking the mouse button (Shift-Click). Exactly what happens next depends on the context.

In text or an array, the result of a Shift-click is always a range. The position where the button is clicked becomes the new endpoint or anchor point of the range; the selection can be extended in any direction. If the user shift-clicks within the current range, the new range will be smaller than the old range.

Extended selections can be made across the panes of a split window. (See "Splitting Windows.")
