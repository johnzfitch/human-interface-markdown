<span id="page-248-4"></span>Third-party plug-ins needn't deter you from providing a drag-installable bundle; the Finder in Mac OS X (version 10.2 and later) provides built-in support for managing plug-ins within your application's bundle. A Plug-ins pane added to your application's Info window in the Finder provides a user interface for adding and removing these files, as well as turning them on and off.  
If your application supports plug-ins, use this feature instead of creating your own plug-in management method. Create a folder for them in your application bundle (<AppName>.app/Contents/Plugins); each item in this folder appears in the Plug-ins pane. You may want to provide user documentation explaining how to use this feature.
