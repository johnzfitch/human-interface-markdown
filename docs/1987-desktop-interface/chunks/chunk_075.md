The Font menu lists the fonts that are currently available. A check mark indicates which font is currently in effect. Figure 3-38 illustrates <sup>a</sup> font menu with some common Macintosh fonts.

#### FontSize menu  
Font sizes are measured in points. A point is <sup>a</sup> typographical unit of measure equivalent to 1/72 inch. The FontSize menu lists the nine standard available sizes. The font size currently in effect is indicated with a check mark (Figure 3-39). Not every font is available in all sizes; the sizes that are available for the selected font are shown outlined in the FontSize menu. A font can be scaled to the other sizes, but scaled fonts usually suffer in appearance on the screen and when printed by some kinds of printers.

If there's insufficient room in the menu bar for the word FontSize, it can be abbreviated to Size. If there's insufficient room for both <sup>a</sup> Font menu and <sup>a</sup> Size menu, the sizes can be put at the end of the Style menu.  
#### Style menu  
Text-oriented applications, such as word processing programs, have a Style menu (Figure 3-40).

Figure 3-40 Standard Style menu  
The operations in the standard Style menu are Plain Text, Bold, Italic, Underline, Outline, and Shadow. Others that can be included here are superscript, subscript, small caps, uppercase, and lowercase. All except Plain Text are accumulating attributes. This means that the user can choose all of them, none of them, or any combination of them. It is important that each attribute can be individually toggled on and off. The user who has accumulated several attributes—bold, italic, and underline, for example—and decides to eliminate bold and italic but keep underline, shouldn't have to choose Plain (which would turn off all three) and then start over by choosing underline.  
An attribute that's in effect for the current selection is preceded, in the Style menu, by a check mark. The absence of the check mark indicates that the attribute is not in effect for the current selection. Choosing Plain Text cancels all the other choices.  
Other menus use plain 12-point Chicago for their text, but the Style menu can be self-documenting by using, for example, shadowed 12-point Chicago to list the shadowed attribute. Apple-key combinations can be used as keyboard shortcuts to the Style menu.
