**Control sizes**: There are no standard sizes for group boxes; you control the size of the boundaries based on the needs of your window. As you place a group box in your window, be sure to follow the spacing recommendations described below.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Group box titles can use different font sizes, depending on the size of the rest of the controls and text in your window:  
■ Regular size: System font  
■ Small: Small system font  
<span id="page-335-0"></span>■ Mini: Mini system font  
**Control spacing**: Leave at least 20 pixels from the edge of the group box to the edge of the window. Nesting group boxes isn't recommended, because it wastes space. However, if you decide to nest group boxes, see "A Tabbed [Window"](#page-339-0) (page 340) for some spacing guidelines.
