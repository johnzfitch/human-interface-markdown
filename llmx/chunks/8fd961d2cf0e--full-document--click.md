#### Click

Click is the action of positioning the pointer over an object and briefly pressing the mouse button. The user *clicks* objects, not *clicks on* objects. Thus your documentation should say

- Click the disk icon.
- Click the Open button.
- Click Auto Page Numbering.

It is OK to say *click in* a window, but the user *clicks* all other onscreen elements. Also, it's not appropriate to say *click and drag*. The user clicks or the user drags.
