Traditionally, a document icon lookslike a piece of paper with itstop-right corner folded down. As previously suggested, document icons should make it obvious which application they are associated with. Preview documents, for example, include a graphic of the media (the pictures) used in the application icon. For simplicity and to avoid confusing the document with the application itself, the viewing tool is not repeated in the document icon.

Document icons are presented asif they are hovering on the desktop, with the shadow behind the document. For more information, see "Icon [Perspectives](#page-140-0) and Materials" (page 141).  
<span id="page-138-2"></span>When you want to put an identifying badge over a document icon, treat the badge as an integrated element within the document instead of putting it over the top of the base image and breaking out of the overall document shape.
