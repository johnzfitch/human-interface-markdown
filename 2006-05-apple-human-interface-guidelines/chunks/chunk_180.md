When space is at a premium, such as in pop-up menus, contractions may be used, as long as the contracted words are not critical to the meaning of the phrase. For example, a menu could contain the following items:  
Don't Allow Printing Don't Allow Modifying Don't Allow Copying  
In each case, the contraction does not alter the operative word for the item. If a contraction does alter the significant word in a phrase, such as "contains" and "does not contain," it is clearer to avoid the contraction.  
You should also avoid using uncommon contractions that may be difficult to interpret and localize. In particular, you should:  
- Avoid forming a contraction using a noun and a verb, such as in the sentence "Apple's going to announce a new computer today."
- <span id="page-128-2"></span><span id="page-128-1"></span>■ Avoid using less common contractions, such as "it'll" and "should've."
