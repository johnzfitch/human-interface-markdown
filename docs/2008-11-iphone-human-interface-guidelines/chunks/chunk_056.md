An **Info button** provides a way to reveal configuration details about an application, often on the back side of the screen. For this reason, Info buttons are especially well suited to utility applications. You can see an example of an Info button in the lower-right corner of the Weather application (shown in Figure 9-4).

Info buttons are available with a light background and a dark background. The light background style (which is shown in Figure 9-4) looks good on a view with a dark background. Conversely, an Info button with a dark background shows up well on a view with a light background.  
An Info button glows briefly when users tap it. When you use the Info button iPhone OS provides, you get this pressed-state appearance automatically.
