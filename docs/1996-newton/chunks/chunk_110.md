The Action picker lists commands for sending and receiving data by communications methods, such as printing, faxing, beaming, and e-mailing. In many applications the Action picker includes additional commands for acting on data that's currently displayed. A separator line divides the routing commands from the other action commands. [Figure 4-20](#page-152-0) shows an example Action picker.

Picking a routing command from an Action picker starts the routing process, which is detailed in [Chapter 7, "Routing and Communications."](#page-206-0) Picking the Duplicate command, if the Action picker includes one, makes an exact copy of the data item or items affected by the Action picker. Picking the Delete command, if the Action picker includes one, brings up a confirmation alert asking the user to authorize deleting the data item or items affected by the Action picker. The function of other commands listed below the separator line in an Action picker are determined by the application that adds them there.
