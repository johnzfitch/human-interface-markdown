<!-- Chunk 129 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 422 -->
Modeless dialog boxes look like basic document windows. A modeless dialog box has a title bar that displays its title, which should be the same as the name of the menu item that displays it. If that item includes an ellipsis character, *don't* include it in the title of the dialog box.  
Figure 6-4 shows the appearance of a modeless dialog box.

Modeless dialog boxes have the same behaviors as document windows—that is, the user manipulates them in the same way. For example, the user closes a modeless dialog box by using the close box or the Close command in the File menu. If you support keyboard equivalents for menus, support Command-W to close modeless dialog boxes as well as windows.  
A modeless dialog box always has a close box; don't implement buttons to make the window disappear. The user expects that modeless dialog boxes stay on the screen until he or she explicitly dismisses them with the close box, *not* when he or she clicks a button in the dialog box.  
Using a button to close a modeless dialog box also confuses the distinction between modeless dialog boxes and modal dialog boxes. Further, a modeless dialog box without a close box looks similar to a movable modal dialog box, thereby creating more confusion. Figure 6-5 shows a modeless dialog box that is missing its close box.

If the user activates another window while a modeless dialog box is open, the window appears in front of the dialog box.
