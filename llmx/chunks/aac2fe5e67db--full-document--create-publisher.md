#### Create Publisher…

The Create Publisher command creates an edition based on the selected data. Your application stores this data in an edition file. This information updates automatically when a user saves the document that contains the publisher. The entire Edition Manager interface is described in the chapter "Edition Manager" in *Inside Macintosh: Interapplication Communication*.

Figure 4-79 shows the first two steps of the process.
