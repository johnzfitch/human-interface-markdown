A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (showor hide)while the parentwindowis open. A drawer should contain frequentlyaccessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. For example, Figure 14-28 shows a drawer that provides details about slide builds in the Keynote Build inspector.

#### <span id="page-216-2"></span>When to Use Drawers  
Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time. This is in contrast to the criterion for a panel,which should be visible and available whenever its mainwindowis in the top layer. (For more information about panels, see ["Panels"](#page-229-0) (page 230).)  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are modal dialogs (as described in ["When](#page-239-0) to Use [Sheets"](#page-239-0) (page 240)), whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.  
<span id="page-216-1"></span>You should not use a drawer to provide users with a way to navigate hierarchically arranged content in your window. If you need to do this in your application, you should use a source list instead. See "Source Lists and [Sidebars"](#page-209-0) (page 210) to learn more about source lists.  
#### Drawer Behavior  
The user shows or hides a drawer, typically by clicking a button or choosing a command. If a drawer contains a valid drop target,you mayalsowant to open the drawerwhen the user drags an appropriate object to where the drawer appears.

When a drawer opens, it appears to be sliding from behind its parent window, to the left, right, or down. You should ensure that a parent window's default position allows its drawer to open fully without disappearing offscreen. If a user moves a parent window to the edge of the screen and then opens a drawer, it should open on the side of the window that has room. If the user makes a window so big that there's no room on either side, the drawer opens off the screen.  
To support the illusion that a closed drawer is hidden behind its parent window, an open drawer should be smaller than its parent window. When the parent window is resized vertically, an open drawer resizes, if necessary, to ensure that it does not exceed the height of the parent window. (A drawer can be shorter than its parent window.) The illusion is further reinforced by the fact that the inner border of a drawer is hidden by the parent window and that the parent window's shadow is seen on the drawer when appropriate.  
The user can resize an open drawer by dragging its outside border. The degree to which a drawer can be resized is determined bythe content of the drawer. If the userresizes a drawer significantly—to the pointwhere content is mostlyobscured—the drawer should simplyclose.For example, if a drawer contains a scrolling list, the user should be able to resize the drawer to cover up the edge of the list. But if the user makes the drawer so small that the items in the list are difficult to identify, the drawer should close. If the user sets a new size (if that is possible) for a drawer, the new size should be used the next time the drawer is opened.  
A drawer should maintain its state (open or closed) when its parent window becomes inactive or when the window is closed and then reopened. When a parent window with an open drawer is minimized, the drawer should close; the drawer should reopen when the window is made active again.  
A drawer can contain any control that is appropriate to its intended use. Follow normal layout guidelines, as stated in "Positioning [Regular-Size](#page-350-1) Controls" (page 351).  
Consider a drawer part of the parentwindow; don't dim a drawer's controlswhen the parentwindow has focus, and vice versa. When full keyboard access is on, a drawer's contents should be included in the window components that the user can select by pressing Tab.
