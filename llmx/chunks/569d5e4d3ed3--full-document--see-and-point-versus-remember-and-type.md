## See-and-Point versus Remember-and-Type

The Apple Desktop Interface is visual and spatially oriented. Objects—whether text, applications, documents, lines, or controls—appear on the screen in well thought out and consistent ways. The screen provides an environment in which people can work effectively, taking full advantage of the power of the computer at their fingertips while still enjoying a reasonable and sensible human environment. Because users must be able to address different parts of the screen, to access the activities represented by objects, pointing is an essential part of the interface. The mouse is currently the most common pointing device, but there are other kinds of input devices that do the same job.

Even more than the WYSIWYG principle, the emphasis on "see-and-point" explicitly adapts to the way people think and work. The user can access, at any time, any available action, simply by pulling down the appropriate menu then using the mouse to select an action. If the user is unsure of what to do, she can quickly scan through all available options and choose one of them.

Even the best of the more traditional command-line interface requires the user to remember (out of context) and type a command to the computer. This makes unreasonable demands on the user's memory—especially when the commands are complex or cryptic. This is especially galling to the new or infrequent user, but it distracts *all* users from the task and focuses their attention instead on computer interaction.

The remember-and-type approach has some advantages for some users. When the user is completely certain of what she wants to do, a simple keystroke can be the fastest way to do it. Some applications include keyboard equivalents for the most often needed menu items. This is a logical extension of the desktop interface, and makes it more effective in particular instances—but keyboard equivalents are an alternative way to access menu items. Users who are learning a new application, or who are browsing through their options, must always be able to do this through menus.

The remember-and-type interface makes more options available to the user than the screen can display at one time. In contrast to the see-and-point interface, where what you see is *all* you get, the remember-and-type interface can *conceal* options. But when you include a large number of options in a see-and-point application, pull—down menus can become cluttered.
