Mac OS X user application icons should be vibrant and inviting, and should immediately convey the application's purpose. The TextEdit icon, for example, indicates clearly that you would use this application to create text documents.

If the primary function of your application is creating or handling media, its icon should display the media the application creates or views. If appropriate, the icon should also contain a tool that communicates the type of task the application allows the user to accomplish. The Preview icon, for example, uses a magnification tool to help convey that the application can be used to view pictures. If you include a supportive tool element, it should closely relate to the base object that it rests upon.

In the Stickies application icon, however, the yellow rectangles are easily identifiable as sticky notes; the icon doesn't include a tool because it isn't necessary to tell the icon's story.

Notice that the text in the Stickies icon is actual text, not simply wavy lines representing text. If you want to "greek" text in an Aqua icon, use actual text and make it unreadable by shrinking it or doubling the layers.  
Generally, Mac OS X user application icons are designed to appear as if they're sitting on a desk in front of you. They have a slightly diminishing perspective (they are wider at the bottom). For more information, see ["Icon Perspectives and](#page-212-2)  [Materials" \(page 213\).](#page-212-2)
