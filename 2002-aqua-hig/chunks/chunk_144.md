Small tabs use the small system font.  
- **Text**: System font (13-point Lucida Grande), centered in tab with 12 pixels on each side. Small tabs: Small system font (11-point Lucida Grande), centered in tab with 10 pixels on each side.
- **Tab height:** 23 pixels. Small: 20 pixels
- **Accent bar height:** 6 pixels. Small: 5 pixels.  
Tab panes can extend from one edge of a window to the other, or they can be inset within a window. Figure 7-25 shows an example of tab panes that extend from one edge of a window to the other.

For inset tab panes, the recommended inset is 20 pixels on each side within a window, although 16 is also allowed. You can define a window so space remains below the tab pane for global controls such as push buttons. Figure 7-26 shows an example of tab panes inset within a window, with buttons below the panes.
