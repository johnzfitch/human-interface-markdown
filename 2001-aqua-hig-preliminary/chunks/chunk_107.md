The keyboard's primary use is to enter text. The keyboard may also be used for navigation, but it should always be an alternative to using the mouse.  
There are three kinds of keys: character keys, modifier keys, and function keys. A **character key** sends a character to the computer. When the user holds down a **modifier key,** it alters the meaning of the character key being pressed or the meaning of a mouse action.
