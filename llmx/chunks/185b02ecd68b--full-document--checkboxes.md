#### Checkboxes

For checkboxes, you need to provide several pieces of information. Describe the current state of the system (what the system does currently, given whether the option is selected or not), an explanation of the option provided by the checkbox, and how to turn it on or off. Don't describe the current state of the system if it's obvious or if it would involve saying merely, "This option is *not* on." Also, don't include an explanation of the option if your users don't need one.

Balloon Help **321**

Figure 11-13 shows an example of a help balloon for a checkbox.

Note that the help balloon shown in Figure 11-13 tells the user about the current state of the system by the way it phrases the sentence: "To turn on text smoothing, click this box." (This means that text smoothing is *not* currently being used.) If the sentence were phrased like this: "To turn *off* text smoothing, click this box," it would tell us the opposite information about the current state of the system (that text smoothing *is* currently being used).

For unavailable checkboxes, describe what the box does when it's selected and then explain why it is not available. This case is similar to that of an unavailable radio button.
