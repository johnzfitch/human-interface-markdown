If a control panel contains a significant number of settings that users are not likely to adjust frequently, then you can let the user show or hide those settings by expanding or contracting the window. The preferred mechanism for this is a labeled disclosure triangle that expands the window downward or contracts it upward. The triangle's label should indicate the nature of the settings (for example, "Server Settings"). [Figure 6-5](#page-115-0) shows a control panel with the disclosure triangle in the closed state.

See ["Disclosure Triangles" \(page 37\)](#page-36-0) for more information about disclosure triangles.  
If, due to space or layout problems, you cannot have your control panel open downwards, you can use a push button to expand or contract the window's right edge.
