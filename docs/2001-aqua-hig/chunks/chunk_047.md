Mac OS X 10.1 enables open applications to customize their Dock icon's menu by adding to the default items provided by the Dock. Potential additional items include common commands to initiate actions in your application when it is not frontmost, and commands that are applicable when there is no open document window. For example, a mail application could provide commands to initiate a new message or to check for new messages. Application-specific items appear above the standard Dock menu items.
