Except for dialog boxes used to select colors, there's no reason to color the controls or text in dialog boxes; they should be designed and laid out clearly enough that color isn't necessary to separate different sections or items. Alert boxes must be as clear as possible; color can add confusion instead of clarity. For example, if you tried to make things clearer by using red to mean "dangerous" and green to mean "safe" in the Erase Disk alert, the OK button ("go") would be red and the Cancel button ("stop") would be green. Don't do this.
