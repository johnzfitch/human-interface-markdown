# Text

- Can arrow keys be used in all text boxes (including dialog boxes)? Can the Shift key be used with the arrow keys to extend the selection (including in dialog boxes)?
- If text is selected, does pressing an arrow key cause the insertion point to go to the corresponding end of the range and deselect it?
- Are discontinuous selections made with the Command key modifier (for text and arrays)? The Shift key is used for graphics selections.
- Do you support intelligent cut-and-paste where appropriate?
- Do you use Command-arrow and Option-arrow for moving the insertion point in larger semantic units? (Note that when multiple script systems are available, Command–Left Arrow and Command–Right Arrow are intercepted by the Script Manager and used for changing the script system.)
- If your application supports TrueType fonts, do you support all font sizes instead of imposing a size limit?
- Do the users have a way to choose whatever font size they desire?
- Does the active font size in a menu have a checkmark next to it?
- Are available font sizes shown in outline in the menu items?
- Do you avoid making assumptions about font sizes? For example, the system font may have a different size in other countries.
