<span id="page-252-3"></span>A **slider control** lets users choose from a continuous range of allowable values.  
- Slider controls can be horizontal or vertical. In deciding whether a slider should be horizontal or vertical, try to meet users' expectations of similar real-world controls.
- Slider controls can display labeled tick marks to represent increments you specify.
- The slider itself (the thumb) can be either directional or round.
- Slider controls support live feedback (live dragging) so users can see the effect of moving the slider as it is dragged. Dock preferences, for example, shows the effect of moving the Dock Size slider.  
**Carbon:** Sliders are available in Interface Builder. You can create them programmatically with the function CreateSliderControl.  
**Cocoa:** Sliders area available in Interface Builder. To create one programmatically, use the NSSlider class. See *Sliders* in Cocoa User Experience documentation.
