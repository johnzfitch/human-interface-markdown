<span id="page-173-1"></span>When users refer to help, it is usually because they have reached an impasse while attempting to accomplish a task—they know what they want to do, but not how to accomplish it. When faced with an impasse, most users first try to figure it out for themselves by exploring and experimenting with the interface. If that fails, they ask someone else for assistance; if no one is available, they may consult the onscreen Help.  
Users come to help with a specific goal in mind, bringing their cumulative Macintosh experience and the recent and cumulative experience of using the product. In all likelihood, they are somewhat impatient and frustrated at having failed to figure out how to accomplish their goal.  
To assist users in quickly locating their information and getting back to work, onscreen help should do the following:  
- Focus on real-world user tasks.
- Get to the point quickly, so that users can return to work.
- Be organized by task, not the layout or functionality of the software.  
In large Help systems, searching is often the most efficient way to locate a particular topic, particularly when users have turned to help with a specific idea about what they are trying to accomplish. To facilitate usable search results, do the following:  
- Cover one topic per page, to avoid "burying" some tasks.
- Title the page descriptively, using words that relate to real-world goals.
- Use Apple Help keywords to ensure synonyms and common misspellings get appropriate search results.
- Write steps and descriptions using words that appear in the interface.  
Write your Help so that users can quickly find the steps on the page and can follow the steps without having to repeatedly switch between the product and the Help Viewer.  
- Don't repeat notes and warnings enforced by the interface. For example, if you have to click OK to confirm a setting, don't describe it in the steps—it will be apparent as the users follow the instructions.
- Tailor descriptions to the probable experience of users. For example, a user who wants to adjust kerning is likely to be familiar with selecting a typeface and font size.
- Automate common tasks using AppleScript. If a task requires opening a preferences pane, provide an automation that opens it for users. If you can automate the entire task, do so.
- Emphasize trouble identification and resolution. If a step or task might be impossible because of an error condition, remind users to check for it early in your instructions. Users might already know how to accomplish a task but turn to help because of a condition or requirement they couldn't identify.
