A **toggled menu item** changes between two states each time a user chooses it. There are three types of toggled menu items:  
- A group of two menu items that are opposite states; for example, Grid On and Grid Off. The state currently in effect has a checkmark next to it. If you have room in your menu, it's a good idea to display both items (rather than changing the name depending on its state) so there's less chance of confusion about each item's effect.
- One menu item whose name changes to reflect the current state; for example, Show Ruler and Hide Ruler. Use this type if your menu doesn't have room to show both states.  
<span id="page-48-1"></span>Use two verbs that express opposite actions. Make sure the command name is completely unambiguous. For example, Turn Grid On and Turn Grid Off is unambiguous. Choosing the command Use Grid, however, could turn the grid on (it describes what happens as a result of choosing the command) or off (it describes the current state).

<span id="page-49-2"></span>■ A menu item that has a checkmark next to it when it is in effect; for example, a style attribute such as Bold. Don't use this kind of toggled item to indicate the presence or absence of a feature like a grid or ruler. It's unclear whether the checkmark means that the feature is in effect or whether choosing the command turns the feature on.
