#### **Mouse Responsiveness**  
The cursor moves on-screen when the us.er moves the mouse, but the ratio of the two movements isn't one-to-one. Rapid mouse movements move the cursor farther than slow ones. Users can set the *mouse scaling,* how responsive the cursor is to mouse movements at different speeds, with the Preferences application.
