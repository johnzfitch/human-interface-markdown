Users use the Ring/Silent switch to silence their devices when they want to:  
- Avoid being interrupted by unexpected sounds,such as Phone ringtones and incoming message sounds.
- Avoid hearing soundsthat are the byproducts of user actions,such as keyboard or other feedback sounds, incidental sounds, or application startup sounds.  
■ Avoid hearing game sounds, including incidentalsounds and soundtracks, that are not essential to using the game.  
For example, in a theater users switch their devices to silent to avoid bothering other people in the theater. In this situation, users still want to be able to use applications on their devices, but they don't want to be surprised by sounds they don't expect or explicitly request, such as ringtones or new message sounds.  
However, the Ring/Silent switch does *not* silence sounds that result from user actions that are solely and explicitly intended to produce sound. For example:  
- Media playback in a media-only application is not silenced by the Ring/Silent switch because the media playback was explicitly requested by the user.
- A Clock alarm is not silenced by the Ring/Silent switch because the alarm was explicitly set by the user.
- A sound clip in a language-learning application is not silenced by the Ring/Silent switch because the user took explicit action to hear it.
- Conversation in an audio chat application is not silenced by the Ring/Silent switch because the user started such an application for the sole purpose of having an audio chat.  
<span id="page-53-0"></span>This behavior follows the principle of user control because it is up to the user, not the device, to decide whether it's appropriate to hear sounds the user explicitly requests.
