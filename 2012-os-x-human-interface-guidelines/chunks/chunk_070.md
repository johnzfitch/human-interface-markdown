Calendar allows users to manage their schedules. They can create events, specify the time and location of an event, and invite others to join. You can integrate Calendar information directly into your app so that users do not need to look up or reenter information. With the Event Kit framework, you can access users' events and create, edit, or delete new events. See *Calendar and Reminders Programming Guide* for more information.  
**Do not modify a user's Calendar data without permission.** Before creating, editing, or deleting a user's event, make sure you get permission from the user. Additionally, when you perform operations on a group of events that result in significant changes to the user's Calendar, make sure the user is fully informed of the action your app is about to perform.
