The system font is a specially optimized version of Helvetica Neue that gives your text unmatched legibility, clarity, and consistency. Yosemite tunes Helvetica Neue to balance aesthetics and layout compatibility so that most apps can look great without making any changes. In particular, apps that use Auto Layout to express the relationships among views in the UI can respond automatically to slight changes in font metrics.  
**Important:** Always designate a system font by name, such as systemFontOfSize: or boldSystemFontOfSize:. If you instead specify "Helvetica Neue" in code or in Interface Builder, you get the nonoptimized version of the font, which is suitable only for the content of a document. Using the nonoptimized font in your UI can have unexpected results.
