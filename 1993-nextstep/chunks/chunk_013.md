Every running application is represented on-screen by an icon. This icon lets the user choose the application to work in. To choose an application, the user simply double-clicks its icon.  
An application icon can be either freestanding or docked. Docked icons line up along the right edge of the screen. They stay on-screen even when the applications they represent aren't running; this makes it easy to start up commonly used applications (by double-clicking the docked icon). A freestanding icon stays on-screen only as long as the application is running. Users can customize their environment by dragging application icons into and out of the application dock.

The Workspace Manager adds three small dots—similar to an ellipsis—in the lower left corner of a docked icon when the application the icon represents isn't running. The three dots disappear when the application is started up. While it's starting up, the icon is highlighted in white, as shown above.  
#### **Controls**  
Controls are devices that let users give information to or choose an action in an application. Controls are usually presented to users in panels or menus, although standard windows can also contain controls. The following figure shows some of the controls used in NeXTSTEP. (Although menu commands are controls, they're used only in menus, so they're illustrated in the "Menus" section, earlier).

The following sections describe each of the NeXTSTEP controls in more detail. If necessary, you can also create your own controls. Chapter 7, "Controls," has more information.  
#### **Buttons**  
Buttons are the primary controls for starting an action or setting a state. Users manipulate buttons by moving the mouse so that the cursor is over the button, and then clicking—pressing and releasing the mouse button.  
Buttons can be very basic—with just a word or picture on a rectangular, raised-looking button—or they can be more complex. The following figure shows some simple buttons that are typical of those used to start actions.

Another kind of button that initiates actions is one that controls a *pull-down list*. A pull-down list is a combination of a button and a menulike list. The button itself doesn't cause an action (other than displaying the list), but it lets the user choose a list item that causes an action. For example:

Buttons that set a state, as opposed to initiating an action, tend to be a little more complex than action buttons. Typical state buttons are shown in the figure below.

A pop-up list, like a pull-down list, is a combination of a button and a list. A pop-up list's button doesn't actually set a state, but it brings up a menulike list from which the user can choose an option that sets the state. Unlike a pull-down list, the title of a pop-up list's button changes to display the list item that was chosen (such as from Inches to Centimeters).
