<span id="page-89-2"></span>Most applications add information to a document as soon as the user enters it. In some cases, however, the application may need towait until awhole collection of information is available before processing it. The Enter key tells the application that the user has finished entering information in a particular area of the document, such as a text field. While the useris enteringtext into a *text* document, pressing Enter has no effect.  
If a dialog has a default button, pressing Enter (or Return) is the same as clicking it.  
#### <span id="page-89-5"></span>**Return**  
In text, the Return key inserts a carriage return (a line break) and moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next line. In arrays, the Return key signals movement to the leftmost field one step lower (like a carriage return on a typewriter). As with Tab, pressing Return can cause data to be entered before focus moves to the next item.  
If a dialog has a default button, pressing Return (or Enter) is the same as clicking it.  
#### <span id="page-89-1"></span>**Delete (or Backspace)**  
<span id="page-89-4"></span>Generally, if an item is selected, pressing Delete (or Backspace) removes the selectionwithout putting it on the Clipboard. If nothingis selected, pressing Delete removes the character precedingthe insertion point without putting it on the Clipboard. The Delete key has the same effect as the Delete command in the Edit menu.  
**Note:** The Deletekeyis different from theForward Delete (Fwd Del)key(labeled *Del*),which removes characters following the insertion point. See ["Forward](#page-94-0) Delete (Fwd Del)" (page 95).  
The Option key can be used to extend a deletion to the next semantic unit (such as a word). The Command key can extend a deletion to the next semantic unit beyond that supported by Option. Recommended key combinations for text applications are Command-Delete to delete the previous word and Command–Fwd Del to delete the next word. Option-Delete could delete either the word containing the insertion point or the part of the word to the left of the insertion point, depending on what makes the most sense in your application; Option–Fwd Del could delete the part of the word to the right of the insertion point.
