Beautiful, compelling icons are a fundamental part of the OS X user experience. Far from being merely decorative, icons play an essential role in communicating with users.  
Every app must include several size variations of the app icon for display in the Finder, Dock, Launchpad, and elsewhere. Many apps need to supply additional icons, such as toolbar and document icons. To look at home on OS X, all of these icons should be meticulously designed, informative, and aesthetically pleasing.  
Unlike other custom artwork in your app, these icons must meet specific criteria so that OS X can display them properly. In addition, icon files have sizing and naming requirements. To support resolution independence, you should provide standard- and high-resolution versions of your icons. For guidelines on how to create icons, see "Creating Great Icons for Any [Resolution"](#page-114-0) (page 115).
