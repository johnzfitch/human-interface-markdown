The user selects a range of text by dragging through the range. A range is either a range of words or a range of individual characters, as described under "Selecting Words", above.

SELECTING 77  
If the user extends the range, the way the range is extended depends on what kind of range it is. If it's a range of individual characters, it can be extended one character at a time. If it's a range of words (including a single word), it's extended only by whole words.
