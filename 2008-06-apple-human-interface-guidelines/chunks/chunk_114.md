<span id="page-94-7"></span><span id="page-94-5"></span>In the Macintosh interface, the standard pointing device isthe mouse. Users can substitute other devices—such as trackballs and stylus pens—that maintain the behavior of direct manipulation of objects on screen.  
Moving the mouse without pressing the mouse button moves the **cursor**, or pointer. The onscreen cursor can assume differentshapes according to the context of the application and the cursor's position. For example, in a word processor, the cursor takes the I-beam shape while it's over the text and changes to an arrow when it's over a tools palette. Change the cursor's shape *only* to provide information to the user about changes in the cursor's function. More information on using cursors correctly can be found in ["Cursors"](#page-156-0) (page 157)  
Just *moving* the mouse changes only the pointer'slocation, and possibly itsshape. *Pressing* the mouse button indicates the intention to do something, and *releasing* the mouse button completes the action.  
<span id="page-94-2"></span>These guidelines apply to single-button mice and to the primary button of multi-button mice. Note that users can select which button of a multi-button mouse to designate as the primary button in the Keyboard & Mouse System Preferences.
