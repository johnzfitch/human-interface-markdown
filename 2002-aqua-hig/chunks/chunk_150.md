Use an **image well** to display an icon or picture that serves as a drag-and-drop target. You could use a set of image wells to manage thumbnails in a clip-art catalog, for example. Don't use image wells in place of push buttons or bevel buttons.

Some image wells (the user picture in the Edit User pane of Accounts preferences, for example) must always contain an image. If the user can clear an image well (leaving it empty) in your application, provide standard Edit menu commands and Clipboard support.
