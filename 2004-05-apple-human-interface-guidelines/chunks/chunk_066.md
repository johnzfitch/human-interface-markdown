Don't use technical jargon or programming terms in interface elements or user documentation. Table 4-3 shows a few examples; more are in *Apple Publications Style Guide* (available at the Mac OS X developer documentation website).

Aqua offers a photo-illustrative icon style—it approaches the realism of photography but uses the features of illustrations to convey a lot in a small space. Icons can be represented in 128 x 128 pixels to allow ample room for detail. Anti-aliasing makes curves and nonrectilinear lines possible. Alpha channels and translucency allow for complex shading and dimensionality. All of these qualities pave the way for lush imagery that enables you to create vibrant icons.  
To represent your application in Mac OS X, it's essential to create high-quality Aqua-style application icons that scale well in the various places the icon appears—the Dock, Finder previews, alert dialogs, and so on.  
**Carbon:** See "Desktop Icons" in *Learning Carbon*, published by O'Reilly, for information on how to provide custom application and document icons.
