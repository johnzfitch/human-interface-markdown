#### Window manipulation

There are very standard conventions for opening, closing, moving, sizing, scrolling, and zooming windows. No matter what application is being used, users know how to control the appearance of windows on the screen, and how to adjust the workspace for particular tasks and to their tastes.

When the user manipulates windows on the screen, visual feedback is immediate. When users move windows, they have the sense of directly moving them; changes in the graphic display keep up with the user's movements. When users open or close windows they see an illusion of such opening or closing, enhancing the sense of "real world" activity. When a document is scrolled, the scroll box provides direct visual feedback about the position of the current view within the document as a whole.

All of these mechanisms emphasize user control and the direct manipulation of concrete objects.
