You can use a table view to display large orsmall amounts of information cleanly and efficiently. For example, you can use a table view to:  
**Provide a list of options from which users can select**. You can use the checkmark to show usersthe currently selected option (or options) in the list.  
To display a list of choices users see when they tap an item in a table row, you can use either a plain or a grouped table view. To display a list of choices users see when they tap a button or other UI element that is not in a table row, use the plain style.  
**Display hierarchical information**. The plain table style is well-suited to display a hierarchy of information. Each list item can lead to a different subset of information displayed in another list. Users follow a path through the hierarchy by selecting one item in each successive list. The disclosure indicator tells users that tapping anywhere in the row reveals the subset of information in a new list.  
**Display conceptually grouped information**. Both table view styles allow you to provide context by supplying header and footer text between sections of information. The rounded corners of the grouped style make separate groups of information easy to see, even when users are scrolling quickly.  
**Display information that is indexed to facilitate lookup**. The plain style supports an index view that helps users quickly find what they need. The index consists of a column of entries (usually letters in an alphabet) that floats on the right edge of the screen. Users tap (or drag to) an index entry to reveal the corresponding area in the list.  
If you include an index, avoid using table-view elements that display on the right edge of the table (such as the disclosure indicator), because these elements interfere with the index.  
**Always provide feedback when users select a list item**. Users expect a table row to highlight briefly when they tap a selectable item in it. After tapping, users expect an immediate action to occur: Either a new view appears or the row displays a checkmark to indicate that the item has been selected or enabled.  
In rare cases, a row might remain highlighted when secondary details or controls related to the row item are displayed in the same screen. However, thisis not encouraged because it is difficult to display simultaneously a list of choices, a selected item, and related details or controls without creating an uncomfortably crowded layout.  
Follow these guidelines when you use table views:  
**Consider animating the changes users make to list items** to provide feedback and strengthen the user's sense of direct manipulation. In Settings, for example, when users turn off the automatic date and time setting (by selecting Off in General > Date & Time > Set Automatically), the list group expands smoothly to display two new items, Time Zone and Set Date & Time.  
**If table content is extensive or complex, avoid waiting until all the data is available before displaying anything**. Instead, fill the onscreen rows with textual data immediately and display more complex data (such as images) as they become available. This technique gives users useful information right away and increases the perceived responsiveness of your application.  
**Consider displaying "stale" data while waiting for new data to arrive**. If your app displays data that changes infrequently, you might consider this technique so that users can see something useful right away. This technique is not recommended for applications that handle data that changes frequently. Before you decide to do this, gauge how often the data changes and how much users depend on seeing fresh data quickly.  
**If the data is slow-loading or complex, provide users with a signal that processing is continuing**. If a table contains only complex data, it might be difficult to display anything useful right away. In these rare cases, it'simportant to avoid displaying empty rows, because this can imply that the application hasstalled. Instead, the table should display a spinning activity indicator along with an informative label, such as "Loading...", centered in the screen. This provides feedback to users, letting them know that processing is continuing.  
**Avoid variable row heights in a plain table**. Variable row heights are acceptable in grouped tables, but they can make a plain table look cluttered and uneven.  
**Generally, use grouped tables for the value 1 and value 2 cell styles**. Although you can use any cell style with either type of table, the value 1 and value 2 cell styles look best in grouped tables. For example, Settings uses the value 1 cell style and iPhone Contacts uses the value 2 cell style.

**As much as possible, ensure that your text labels are succinct to avoid truncation**. Truncated words and phrases can be difficult for users to scan and understand. Text truncation is automatic in all table-cell styles, but it can present more or less of a problem, depending on which cell style you use and on where truncation occurs.  
- In the default cell style, short text labels are best. If truncation is unavoidable, try to ensure that the most important information is contained in the first few words.
- In the subtitle cell style, too, short text labels are best. If truncation is unavoidable, focus on putting the most important information in the first few words. If the detail text label is truncated, users are not likely to mind too much because they view it as information that enhances or supplements the item named by the text label.
- In the value 1 cell style, text truncation can be difficult to avoid (because both labels are on the same line), but it's worth the effort. Otherwise, you lose the active space between the labels that helps users understand the relationship between the two pieces of information.
- In the value 2 cell style, truncated text labels blunt the sharpness of the vertical strip of white space between them and the detail text. When the white-space width is inconsistent from row to row, it's harder for users to scan the information in the detail text.  
You might be able to avoid text truncation by increasing the height of a table row to accommodate text wrapping, but this can be problematic for these reasons:  
- You have to programmatically check the text length and decide if wrapping might occur. You must make this determination for both portrait and landscape orientation, because the table width affects text wrapping.
- Text might wrap in one orientation, but not the other, which is something you should avoid.  
iOS UI Element Usage Guidelines  
● Variable row heights can negatively impact the overall table view performance in your application, regardless of table-view style.  
**If you want to lay out your table rows in a nonstandard way**, it's better to create a custom table-cell style than to significantly alter a standard one. To learn how to create your own cells, see "Customizing Cells" in *Table View Programming Guide for iOS*.
