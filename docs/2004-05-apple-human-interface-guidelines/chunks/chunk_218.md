**arrow keys** The four keys on Apple keyboards (up, down, left, right) used to move the insertion point or change the selection. They can also be used with the Shift key to extend or shrink a selection.  
**asynchronous progress indicator** A small round indeterminate progress indicator. It is usually visible only while active.

Use of this control is limited to cases where the window is shared among multiple applications and the menu contains commands that affect the window's contents. A closed pop-down menu always displays the same text, which is the menu title. Pop-down menus have a single, downward-pointing triangle.
