Reserved for use by Apple, the right side of the menu bar may contain items that provide feedback on and access to certain hardware or network settings. The icon for the battery strength indicator, for example, dynamically displays the current state of the battery; clicking the icon displays a menu for changing common battery settings. Users can display or hide a menu bar status item in the appropriate preferences pane.  
#### **Important**  
Don't create your own menu bar status items. Use the Dock menu functions to open a menu from your application's icon in the Dock.  
If there is not enough room in the menu bar to display all menus, menu bar status items are removed first.
