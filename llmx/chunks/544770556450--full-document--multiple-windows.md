## Multiple windows

Some applications can keep several windows on the desktop at the same time. Each window is in a different plane. Windows can be moved around on the desktop much as pieces of paper can be moved around on a real desktop. Each window overlaps those behind it and is overlapped by those in front of it. Even when windows don't overlap, they retain their frontto-back ordering.

Each application may deal with the meaning and creation of multiple windows in its own way. Different windows can represent

- separate documents being viewed or edited simultaneously
- related parts of a logical whole (such as the listing, execution, and debugging of a program)
- different views of the same information (such as a spreadsheet and a graph that represent the same numbers)

The disadvantage of multiple windows is that the desktop can become cluttered. Some applications provide, in the menu bar, a Windows menu. This menu allows the user to quickly choose a window even though it may be out of sight under other windows.
