Every application should supply a small icon that iOS can display when the application name matches a term in a Spotlight search. Applications that supply settings should also supply this icon to identify them in the built-in Settings application.  
Thisicon should clearly identify your app so that people can recognize it in a list ofsearch results or in Settings.  
For iPhone and iPod touch, iOS uses the same icon for both Spotlight search results and Settings. If you do not provide this icon, iOS might shrink your application icon for display in search results and in Settings. For your iPhone app, create two small icons that measure:  
- 29 x 29 pixels
- 58 x 58 pixels (high resolution)  
For iPad, you supply separate icons for Settings and Spotlight search results. Create two icons that measure:  
- 29 x 29 pixels (for Settings)
- 50 x 50 pixels (for Spotlight search results)  
Note that the final visualsize of thisicon is 48 x 48 pixels. iOS trims 1 pixel from each side of your artwork and adds a drop shadow. Be sure to take this into account as you design your icon for Spotlight search results.
