#### Tab

In text-oriented applications, the Tab key is used to move the insertion point to the next tab stop. In other contexts, Tab is <sup>a</sup> signal to proceed: it signals movement to the next item in a sequence. Pressing Tab often causes an Enter operation before the tab takes place. While the user is entering text into a text document, pressing Tab moves the insertion point to the next tab stop.
