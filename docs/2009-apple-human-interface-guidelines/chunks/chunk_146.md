The *Apple Publications Style Guide* covers style and usage issues, and is the key reference for how Apple uses language. Consult it whenever you have a question about the preferred style of particular terms.  
For issues that aren't covered in the *Apple Publications Style Guide*, Apple recommends three other works: *The American Heritage Dictionary*, *The Chicago Manual of Style*, and *Words Into Type*. When these books give conflicting rules, *The Chicago Manual of Style* takes precedence for questions of usage and *The American Heritage Dictionary* for questions of spelling.
