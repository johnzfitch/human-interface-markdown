<span id="page-152-2"></span>Small versions of controls are available in Carbon and Cocoa. Use the smaller versions only when absolutely necessary, and use them sparingly. When converting existing dialogs for use with Aqua, redesign layouts as necessary, rather than relying on the smaller versions of controls. Your first choice in designing for Aqua should always be to use the full-size controls.  
You can use small versions of controls when space is at an extreme premium, such as in tool palettes or other utility windows. Don't mix full-size and small versions of controls in the same window.  
Figure 8-8 shows the specifications for small scroll bars and the resize control. [Figure 8-9](#page-153-1) shows a sample utility window using small controls.

Many users, however, prefer or need to interact with the computer using the keyboard instead of the mouse. In Mac OS X (version 10.1), users have the option of enabling keyboard access for all functions available using a point-and-click device.
