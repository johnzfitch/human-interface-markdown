#### The Screen

All interactions between user and application take place in the context of the screen. Though it does not represent a functional description of the Apple Desktop Interface, the screen is the stage on which the interactions are made visible. The programmer's task is to make the screen to mirror ongoing activities, to make explicit which actions are possible, and to make clear the consequences of any particular action.
