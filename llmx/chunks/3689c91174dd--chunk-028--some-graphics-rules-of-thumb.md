#### Some Graphics Rules of Thumb  
- Icons should be memorable. If they're not immediately recognizable, they should be easily learnable.
- Don't unexpectedly change the way the screen looks. For example, don't scroll automatically more than necessary and don't redraw objects unnecessarily.
- The Apple desktop is a two-dimensional world. Resist the temptation to design icons with a three dimensional or perspective effect, unless there's no other way to convey the information. If several three-dimensional icons appear on the screen together, it's inevitable that they'll have several different perspectives, interfering with the illusion of reality. A drop shadow below and to the right of windows and menus is used, however, to visually separate overlapping two-dimensional objects (see Figure 1).
