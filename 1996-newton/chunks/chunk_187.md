The Intelligent Assistant is a system service that attempts to complete actions specified by a user's written input. You can think of the Assistant as an alternate interface to Newton applications and services. The Assistant can complete a number of tasks using the built-in applications and services, and your application can extend the Assistant to carry out tasks that the application performs. Users can also display an application's online help from the Assistant. This section describes the Assistant's user interface in the context of built-in applications. If your application uses Assistant services, it should behave similarly.
