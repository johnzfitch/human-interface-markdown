When the user makes <sup>a</sup> selection and then either chooses Clear from the Edit menu or presses the Backspace key (Delete key on some keyboards) or the Clear key, the application deletes the highlighted selection. Unlike Cut and Copy, the Clear operation does not put the selection in the Clipboard. The Clipboard is unchanged and the new selection is the same as it would be after <sup>a</sup> cut.
