Use a slider to give users fine-grained control over values they can choose or the operation of the current process.  
**If appropriate, customize the appearance of a slider**. For example, you can do any of the following:  
- Display a slider either horizontally or vertically.
- Set the width of a slider to fit in with the UI of your app.
- Define the appearance of the thumb, so that users can see at a glance whether the slider is active.  
- Supply images to appear at both ends of the slider to help users understand what the slider does.
- Typically, these custom images correspond to the minimum and maximum values of the value range that the slider controls. A slider that controls font size, for example, could display a very small character at the minimum end and a very large character at the maximum end.
- Define a different appearance for the track, depending on which side of the thumb it is on and which state the control is in.
