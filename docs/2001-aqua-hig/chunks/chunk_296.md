**pop-down menu** A menu that contains commands and appears in a window rather than in the menu bar. Use of this control is limited to cases where the window is shared among multiple applications and the menu contains commands that affect the window's contents.

**scroller** The part of a **scroll bar** that the user drags to view other parts of a document. The scroller size reflects how much of the document is visible; the smaller the scroller, the less of the content the user can see at that time.

**scrolling list** A list in a dialog that uses **scroll bars** to reveal its contents.
