iPhone OS supports numerous types of software, ranging from webpages that users view in Safari on iPhone to iPhone applications that run natively on iPhone OS–based devices. This chapter outlines the different types of software solutions you can create for iPhone OS–based devices.  
If you're new to the platform, be sure to begin with the summary of differences between iPhone OS–based devices and computers given in the first section, "Platform Differences to Keep in Mind." Although the information in that section is not comprehensive, it touches on the issues you need to be aware of as you design an iPhone application.  
Then, to help you plan an iPhone application, this chapter describes waysto think about different application styles and the characteristics that define them. This chapter also describes how some of the bundled Mac OS X applications were transformed into versions appropriate for iPhone OS. If you have an existing computer application you'd like to refashion for iPhone OS, understanding this process is key.
