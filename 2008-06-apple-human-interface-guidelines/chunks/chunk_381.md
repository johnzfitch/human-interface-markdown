A **date picker** allows users to select a specific date and time in a window. The date-picker control provides two styles of date and time selection:  
- A combination of a text field and stepper control
- A graphical calendar and clock  
The Date & Time preferences pane uses both types of date picker, as shown in Figure 15-42.
