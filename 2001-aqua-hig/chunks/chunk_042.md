People with a hearing disability cannot hear auditory output at normal volume levels, or cannot hear it at all. Software should never rely solely on sound to provide information; if important cues are given with sound, they should be available  
visually as well. When playing an alert or other sound intended to get the user's attention, your application should call the system alert to ensure that the audio cue also has a visual cue.  
To indicate activity, hardware should have visible lights in addition to the sound generated by the mechanisms. Hardware that specifically produces sound should facilitate external amplification. For example, including a jack for external speakers or headphones allows people to amplify sound to an appropriate level.
