Checkmarks indicate a setting that applies to an entire selection. Dashes indicate settings that apply to only part of a selection.  
In a mutually exclusive attribute or action group of commands, only one item is in effect at any one time. (In dialog boxes, mutually exclusive options are represented by radio buttons.) In a menu, use a checkmark to indicate the item that's in effect. For example, the Left, Center, and Right commands in a graphics menu are a set of three commands, only one of which can be in effect at any time. A checkmark indicates which item is in effect for the current selection. When the user chooses a new menu item, move the checkmark to that item. Figure 4-17 shows how to correctly use a checkmark to mark a choice in a mutually exclusive group of items.

In an accumulating (nonexclusive) attribute group, any number of attributes can be in effect at the same time. (In dialog boxes, these options are represented by checkboxes.) Figure 4-18 shows a Style menu when all the selected text is bold.

Use dashes to indicate that an attribute applies to only part of the selection. For example, if a selection of text appears in two different styles, display a dash next to each style name. Figure 4-19 shows this state.

You can use a combination of these marks when appropriate. Figure 4-20 shows an example where the entire selection is bold, part of the selection is also italicized, and part of the selection is underlined. (This technique of using many styles in text is not recommended for best readability.)
