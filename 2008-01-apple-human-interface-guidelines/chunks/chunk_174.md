Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides images that represent the standard "user," "group," and "all" categories of permissions or privileges, including access control lists (or ACLs). Each of these images is shown in Table 11-6, alongwith its meaningand name. It is recommended thatyou use these images to clarify which users have permissions to read, write, or execute an item. These images allow you to avoid displaying Unix-style permissions indicators, such as rwxr-xrw-, which are suitable only for very sophisticated users.  
<span id="page-159-4"></span>Note that the "user group" permissions image shown in Table 11-6 looks similar to the image for the "user accounts" preferences category, shown in [Table](#page-158-1) 11-4 (page 159). As with all system-provided images, however, similar appearance does not implysimilar meaningor usage. Be sure to avoid using system-provided images incorrectly.
