A tabbed window, like the one shown in Figure 16-5 follows the same general guidelines as those outlined in "A Simple [Preferences](#page-336-2) Window" (page 337). However, it illustrates another implementation of many of the same basic guidelines you've seen so far, along with some new guidelines.

Center-equalization is again evident in Figure 16-6. The overall effect of the window is a balance between the visual weight of the controls on one side of the invisible center axis with the weight of the controls on the other side. The controls are also collectively balanced within each group box so that the distance from the farthest control on each side of the group box is the same for both the right and left sides.  
<span id="page-340-1"></span>Also as shown in Figure 16-6, always center a tab view within a window.

Figure 16-7 illustrates a few guidelines about control placement:  
- The colons for stacked labels are right-aligned.
- Stacked controls are left-aligned when appropriate.
- <span id="page-341-0"></span>■ Similar controls have consistent widths. For example, the sizes of the Font pop-up menus and the Size combo boxes are the same in each group box.

Like the simple preferences window example in "A Simple [Preferences](#page-336-2) Window" (page 337), the tabbed window shown in this section uses white space in a consistent way. For example, in Figure 16-8, you can see:  
- Equal margins between the sides of the group boxes and the tab-pane side edges (the window in Figure 16-8 uses a 16-pixel margin in these areas).
- Equal margins between the sides and bottom of the tab pane and the window edges (the window in Figure 16-8 uses a 20-pixel margin in these areas).
- In both group boxes, the same amount of space between the bottom control and the lower edge of the group box, and the same amount of space between the top control and the upper edge of the group box. (The window in Figure 16-8 uses a 16-pixel margin between the bottom controls in each group box and the lower edge of the group box, and a 10-pixel margin between the top controls in each group box and the upper edge of the group box.)  
In addition, the window in Figure 16-8 uses a 12-pixel margin between the top of the tab bar to the bottom of the title bar (see "Tab Views" (page 329) for more information about tab views). Note that this margin would be the same width if the window included a toolbar.
