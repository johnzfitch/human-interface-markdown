Use a disclosure triangle when you want to provide a simple default view of something but need to allow the user to view more details or perform additional actions at times. Specifically, you can use a disclosure triangles in either of the two following ways:  
- To reveal more information in dialogs that have a minimal state and an expanded state. See Figure 15-76 for an example of a disclosure triangle in a dialog.
- To revealsubordinate itemsin a hierarchical list. See [Figure](#page-324-1) 15-80 (page 325) for an example of a disclosure triangle in a hierarchical list.  
Don't use a disclosure triangle to display additional choices associated with a specific control, such as a pop-up menu. If you need to do this, use a disclosure button (see ["Disclosure](#page-321-0) Buttons" (page 322)).
