#### Dialogs, alerts, and controls

Among the other standard elements are window-like dialog boxes and alert boxes—and the specific controls that are used in these boxes. These boxes provide a standard framework in which the computer can present alternatives from which the user can choose.

The purpose of **dialog boxes** is to elicit responses from the user, typically several at one time. For example, the print dialog box enables the user to specify the number of copies to be printed, the pages to be printed, whether there should be a title page, and so on. A dialog box appears whenever the user chooses a menu item that is followed, in the menu itself, by an ellipsis (...). Standard dialog boxes suspend the system until the user either provides the needed information or cancels the operation.

All requests made in dialog boxes are phrased in plain language and in a friendly and non-threatening manner.

When the dialog box is complete, the user dismisses it by "pushing a button" in the dialog box (by clicking the mouse button while the screen pointer is within a button-shaped object within the dialog box). This is not the same way standard windows are closed. Also unlike standard windows, the user can't move or resize modal dialog boxes.

Alerts notify the user, in plain and polite language, whenever an unusual situation occurs. They can warn of dangerous situations, recommend corrective actions, or provide information that might change the user's plans—but the user is always in charge. There are different levels of alerts, according to the severity of the situation.

As with dialog boxes, users dismiss alert boxes by pushing a button, but can't move or resize them.

Standard controls are used within dialog and alert boxes. Their appearance and functions are standardized. They provide users with familiar tools and formats for responding to the computer's need for information. Described in detail in Chapter 3, these controls include buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, and text entry fields.
