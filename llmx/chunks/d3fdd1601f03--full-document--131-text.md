## 131 Text

The text style applies to any information the user enters from the keyboard. Text can be thought of as one long string of characters that is arranged in words and paragraphs. Nearly every application uses text somewhere; it follows the same rules in every context in which it occurs.

Figure 1-2 shows a window containing a typical text document (from Lisawrite). Terms applicable to text are illustrated in the figure. These terms are discussed later in this document.
