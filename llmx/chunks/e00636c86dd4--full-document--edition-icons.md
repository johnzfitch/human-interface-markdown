## Edition Icons

An edition is a file that is created when a user chooses Create Publisher from the Edit menu. The edition icon has a rectangular outline in a horizontal orientation. Figure 8-39 shows the default icons that appear in the Finder if you don't supply a custom icon for editions.

You can customize an edition icon by putting a different graphic inside the rectangle. Maintain the horizontal orientation and the double-dotted line of the icon that identify it as an edition icon. See *Inside Macintosh: Interapplication Communication* for information on the Edition Manager human interface and implementing the Edition Manager.
