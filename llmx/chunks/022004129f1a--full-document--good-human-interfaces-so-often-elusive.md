# Good Human Interfaces: So Often Elusive

The human interface of a program is as vital to its success in the marketplace as its accuracy in performing its task. An otherwise well designed, powerful piece of software or hardware is nearly useless if it is poorly human engineered. As Dr. Frank Gilbreth, the father of time and motion study said: "It is cheaper and more productive to design machines to fit men rather than to force men to fit machines."

Human interface design should come into play from the very beginning. A good design is no mean task: expect to expend a great deal of design and programming effort toward a smooth interface. For most programs with a good human interface, the design of that interface consumes more design time, is more prone to bugs, and is harder to test than any other part.

Apple is in the process of making available a number of packages of routines that should make this task easier. Within the packages are the menu drivers and input routines described in this document. Exact publication times are being set as this document goes to press.
