When a user types a password into a text field, each typed character should appear as a bullet, matching the number of characters typed by the user. If the user deletes a character with the Delete key, one bullet is deleted from the text field and the insertion point moves back one bullet, as if the bullet represented an actual character. Double-clicking bulleted text in a password field selects all the bullets in the text field.  
When the user leaves the text field (by pressing Tab, for example), the number of bullets in the text field should be modified so that the field does not reflect the actual number of characters in the password.

<span id="page-110-4"></span><span id="page-110-0"></span>The technique of dragging an item and dropping it on a suitable destination is called **drag and drop.**  
In this chapter, an item is anything that the user can select, such as text, graphics, and icons. For convenience, this chapter assumes that the user is dragging with the mouse, but these guidelines also apply to other input devices, such as pens and trackballs.
