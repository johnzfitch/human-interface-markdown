<span id="page-50-2"></span>In a Style or Font menu, you can display menu items in the actual style or font so that users can see what effect the text attribute will have.  
Don't use text styles in menus other than a Style or Font menu.

Menus  
<span id="page-52-3"></span><span id="page-52-0"></span>Windows provide a way for people to view and interact with their data. There are various kinds of windows, each with its own function and appearance.  
<span id="page-52-2"></span>**Document windows** contain file-based user data. They present a view into the content that people create and store. If the document is larger than the window, the window shows a portion of the document's contents.  
Other windows, commonly called **utility windows**, "float" above other windows and provide tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. Some utility windows are system-wide (kUtilityWindowClass). In your application, use the kFloatingWindowClass to create windows such as tools palettes.  
Some applications are not document-based, but they still have "main" windows.  
<span id="page-52-5"></span>**Note:** Dialogs and alerts are also types of windows; they are discussed in ["Dialogs" \(page 71\).](#page-70-0)
