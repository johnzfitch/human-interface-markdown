Sometimes you need to provide the user with additional information or functionality in a dialog, but you don't want to display it all the time. To do this, you use one of the disclosure controlsto expand the dialog and reveal the additional information or capability to the user.  
**Use a disclosure button to provide additional choices in a dialog.** In particular, the disclosure button is the appropriate choice when the additional choices are directly related to selections that are offered in a pop-up or command pop-down menu in a dialog. When users click the disclosure button, the dialog expands to reveal selectionsin addition to those listed in the pop-up or command pop-down menu. (For more information about how to use a disclosure button in your dialog, see [Disclosure](#page-185-0) Button (page 186).)  
**Use a disclosure triangle to reveal details that elaborate on the primary information in a dialog.** When users open the disclosure triangle, the dialog expands, revealing additional information and, if appropriate, extra functionality. (For more information about how to use a disclosure triangle in your dialog, see [Disclosure](#page-183-1) [Triangle](#page-183-1) (page 184).)  
**Respond appropriately when users can resize a dialog that contains columns of data.** If users can resize a dialog that displays columns (such as the Open dialog), the columns should grow and additional columns should appear. All other elements should remain the same size and be anchored to the right, center, or left side of the dialog.
