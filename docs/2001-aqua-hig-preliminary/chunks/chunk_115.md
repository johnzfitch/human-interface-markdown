In cases where the user can input information or make a selection, such as dialogs and Finder windows, the user can press Tab or an arrow key to move the keyboard focus from one interface element to another.  
Focus always begins at the first field that accepts keyboard input and moves left to right and top to bottom (in English systems).  
The area that has focus should have a 2-pixel **focus ring** in the dark highlight color. In text input fields, the ring is inside the field. In a list, the ring is above and below the list. In a column, the focus is around all visible columns.

In list and column views, a selected item should be highlighted across the full row. In column view, the selected item has a dark highlight and the folders containing the item have a lighter highlight.  
<span id="page-141-2"></span>When a window becomes inactive, all selections inside it should become the lighter highlight color.
