A **window** provides a frame for viewing and interacting with content in an app.  
Although userstend to view most rectangular areas on the screen as"windows," developers need to understand the differences in the five main varieties of windows in OS X.

A **document window** contains file-based user data.

An **app window** is the main window of an app that is not document-based.

A **panel** floats above other windows and provides tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. In some cases, a panel can be translucent. For more information about panels, see [Panels](#page-144-0) (page 145).  
A **dialog** appears in response to a user action and typically provides ways users can complete the action. A dialog requires a response from the user before it can close. For more information about dialogs, see [Dialogs](#page-150-0) (page 151).

An **alert** is a special type of dialog that appears when a serious problem occurs, such as an error. Because an alert is a dialog, it also requires a user response before it can close. For more  
information about alerts, see [Alerts](#page-171-0) (page 172).  
As you can see in these examples of windows, the overall look of a window in OS X is subtle and understated. In addition,some areas of a window can be translucent,such asthe toolbar and the sidebar. The visually muted effect of a window helps users focus on the content that's important to them.  
**Note:** A popover is not a window per se, but users might think of it as one (especially if they can detach it from its parent UI element or area). To learn more about popovers, see [Popover](#page-216-1) (page 217).
