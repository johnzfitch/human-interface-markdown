<span id="page-89-1"></span>Generally, if an item is selected, pressing Delete (or Backspace) removes the selection without putting it on the Clipboard. If nothing is selected, pressing Delete removes the character preceding the insertion point without putting it on the Clipboard. The Delete key has the same effect as the Delete command in the Edit menu.  
**Note:** The Delete key is different from the Forward Delete (Fwd Del) key (labeled *Del*), which removes characters following the insertion point. See ["Forward Delete \(Fwd Del\)"](#page-94-0) (page 95).  
The Option key can be used to extend a deletion to the next semantic unit (such as a word). The Command key can extend a deletion to the next semantic unit beyond that supported by Option. Recommended key combinations for text applications are Command-Delete to delete the previous word and Command–Fwd Del to delete the next word. Option-Delete could delete either the word containing the insertion point or the part of the word to the left of the insertion point, depending on what makes the most sense in your application; Option–Fwd Del could delete the part of the word to the right of the insertion point.
