Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. Because this approach puts the computer, not the user, in control, it is best confined to parts of the user interface aimed at novice users. Provide the level of user control that is appropriate for your audience (see "Know Your [Audience](#page-24-2) " (page 25) for more information on ways to determine the audience for your application). For some suggestions on how to provide the appropriate level of detail in your user interface, see "Managing [Complexity](#page-46-0) in Your Software ["](#page-46-0) (page 47).
