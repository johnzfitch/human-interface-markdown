#### Figure 65 Intelligent cut and paste  
Note that the selected text is not necessarily exactly the same range that will be cut and, eventually, pasted.  
Intelligent cut and paste should be used only if the application supports the full definition of a word (as detailed in this chapter under "Selections in text"), rather than the definition of a word as "anything between two spaces." These rules apply to any selection that's one or more whole words, whether the user selected it with a double click or as a range selection.
