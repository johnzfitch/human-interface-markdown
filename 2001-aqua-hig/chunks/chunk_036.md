Translating text is a sophisticated, delicate task. Avoid using colloquial phrases or nonstandard usage and syntax. Carefully choose words for menu commands, dialogs, and help text. Translated text can grow up to 50 percent longer than U.S. English text.  
<span id="page-34-4"></span>Potential grammar problems may arise with error messages. Use complete sentences whenever possible. Don't use phrases that you then concatenate to create sentences; the word order may become completely different in another language, rendering the message nonsensical when translated. For example, word order in German usually places the verb at the end of a sentence.
