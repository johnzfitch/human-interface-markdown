Direct manipulation allows people to feel that they are controlling the objects represented by the computer. According to this principle, an onscreen object should remain visible while a user performs an action on it, and the impact of the action should be immediately visible. For example, a user moves a file by dragging its icon from one location to another. With drag and drop, the most common example of direct manipulation, users can drag selected text directly into another document.  
Support direct manipulation when users expect it. Avoid forcing users to use controls to manipulate data. For example, you should be able to send a facsimile by dragging a document's icon to a fax machine icon in the Dock, instead of having to open a utility program, choose a file, and click a Fax button.
