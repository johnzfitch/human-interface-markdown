If the user edits a locked or read-only document and then quits the application or chooses Save, do not display the standard Save Changes alert. Instead, display a sheet explaining that because the document is read-only, it cannot be saved. The sheet should then offer the user the options of saving a copy, rejecting the changes, or continuing to view or edit the document.
