<span id="page-203-2"></span>In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, source lists look different depending on their usage. A source list that provides the primary navigation or selection mechanism for the application as a whole displays a blue background. This type of source list should be the only source list in the application window and should always be visible (unless the user chooses to hide it). The Finder sidebar (shown on the left in [Figure](#page-203-0) 14-22 (page 204)) is an example of thistype ofsource list: It provides primary navigation and selection functionality for the application, it's separated from the rest of the window by a movable splitter, and it's always visible (unless the user chooses to hide it and the toolbar).  
The other style of source list is often used in preferences windows. This type of source list provides selection functionality for the window, but not the application as a whole. A source list of this type displays a white background and might not be separated from the rest of the window by a movable splitter. The Network System Preferences pane contains this type of source list, as shown in Figure 14-23.

Source lists don't generally have headers like lists can, but they can display titles to distinguish subsets of objects or data. For example, the Finder displays several useful subsets of locations in its sidebar, such as Devices, Shared, and Places, as shown on the left in [Figure](#page-203-0) 14-22 (page 204).
