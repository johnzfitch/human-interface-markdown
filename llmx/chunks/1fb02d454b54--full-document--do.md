### Do:

- Let the user have as much control as possible over the appearance of objects on the screen—their arrangement, size, and visibility.
- Use verbs as menu commands.
- Make alert messages self-explanatory.
- Use controls and other graphics instead of just menu commands.
- Take the time to use good graphic design; it really helps.
