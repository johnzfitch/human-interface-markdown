Unlike other windows, an About window combinessome of the behaviors of panels and windows: Like a panel, an About window is not listed in the app's Window menu, and like a window, it remains visible when the app is inactive.  
Make an About window modeless so the user can leave it open and perform other tasks in the app. If you decide to provide an About window, be sure that it:  
- Has a title bar with no title
- Is movable  
- Includes the close button as the only active window control
- Displays your app icon
- Includesthe full app name and version number, which should be the same asthe version number displayed by the Finder
- Includes copyright information, technical support contact information, and a brief description of what the app does  
**Use buttons in an About window if you want to give users a way to contact you.** For example, you might provide a button that opens your website in a browser window or opens a blank email message that is preaddressed to you. Of course, it's best to provide most of your company contact information in the first page of your help documentation. For more information on Help menu items, see The Help [Menu](#page-102-0) (page 103).  
**Consider putting branding elements, such as logos or slogans, in your About window.** An About window isthe appropriate place for these elements because users expect it to provide information about your company and product. Avoid putting such elements in document windows and dialogs.
