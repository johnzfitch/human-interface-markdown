In addition to the command names and how they're grouped, several other features of commands communicate information to the user:  
- A check mark indicates whether an attribute command is currently in effect.
- An ellipsis (...) after a command name means that choosing that command brings up a dialog box. The command isn't actually executed until the user has finished filling in the dialog box and has clicked the OK button or its equivalent.
- The application dims a command (or flanks it with the ASCII 127 checkerboard) when the user can't choose it. If the user moves the pointer over a dimmed item, it isn't highlighted.
- If a command can be chosen from the keyboard, it's followed by the specific modifier key symbol (Open-Apple, Solid-Apple, or diamond  
1/15/85 Tognazzini  
symbol for Control) and the character used to choose it.  
The application can draw its own type of menu. An example of this is the Fill menu in MacDraw.
