#### **Appropriate** Uses **for the Arrow** Keys  
The arrow keys *don't replace the pointing device.* They can be used as a shortcut way to move the insertion point, and (under some circumstances) to make selections. These are the minimum guidelines for arrow keys; you can expand on them where things are left undefined, if you do it in the spirit of the whole guidelines.  
It's up to you to decide whether it's worth the effort to create arrow-key shortcuts for mouse functions. Many users find that remembering a key combination on the order of Command-Shift-Left Arrow is more trouble than it's worth and they'd rather use a mouse anyway. Many others prefer using the keyboard under certain circumstances. And some people have difficulty using a mouse; they appreciate being able to use the keyboard instead.  
An application should use the arrow keys only when appropriate to the task. Applications that deal with text or arrays (word processors, spreadsheets, and data bases, for example) have an insertion point. This insertion point can be moved both by the mouse and by the arrow keys. Graphics applications, on the other hand, have no insertion point.  
As a general rule, arrow keys are used to move the insertion point and to expand or shrink selections. Arrow keys are *never* used to duplicate the function of the scroll bars or to move the pointer. In a graphics application, arrow keys can be used to move objects in one-pixel increments.  
These guidelines apply both to moving the insertion point and to making selections. Making a selection works the same way as moving the insertion point, except that the Shift key is held down. When Shift is used together with an arrow key, it signifies that the user wants to make a selection, much like using the Shift key while clicking the mouse.
