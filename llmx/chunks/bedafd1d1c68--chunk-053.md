Clicking or pressing one of the scroll arrows lets the user see more of the document in the direction of the scroll arrow, so the document seems to move in the opposite direction. For example, when the user clicks the top scroll arrow, the document moves down, bringing the top of the document into view. The scroll box moves in the direction of the arrow being clicked.  
Each click in <sup>a</sup> scroll arrow causes movement <sup>a</sup> distance of one unit in the chosen direction, with the unit of distance being appropriate to the application: one line for a word processor, one row or column for <sup>a</sup> spreadsheet, and so on. For smooth scrolling, units within a document should always be the same size. Pressing the scroll arrow causes continuous movement in its direction.
