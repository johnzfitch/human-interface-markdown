In general, each command in the **File menu** should apply to a single file (most commonly, a user-created document).  
Note that the Preferences and Quit commands, which apply to a whole application, are in the application menu. If your application provides document-specific preferences, make them available in the File menu, preferably right above printing commands. If an application is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate or eliminate it.  
<span id="page-88-0"></span>Several items in the File menu—Save As, Print, and Page Setup, for example—should open sheets. For more information, see ["Document-Modal Dialogs \(Sheets\)"](#page-133-0) (page 134).

![](images/_page_88_Picture_4.jpeg)  
<span id="page-88-5"></span>Standard File menu commands include these:  
<span id="page-88-3"></span>**New (Command-N).** Opens a new document named "untitled" (or "untitled 2," and so on, as appropriate). If your application requires documents to be named upon creation, you can display a Save dialog (see ["Dialogs for Saving, Closing, and Quitting"](#page-142-0) (page 143)). For more information about naming new document windows, see ["Opening Windows"](#page-112-1) (page 113).  
<span id="page-88-6"></span>**Open (Command-O).** Displays a dialog for choosing an existing document to open. For more information, see ["The Open Dialog"](#page-140-0) (page 141).  
<span id="page-88-1"></span>**Open Recent.** The Open command should be followed by Open Recent so that people can open recently opened documents without using the Open dialog. The Open Recent submenu displays documents in the order in which they were opened, with the most recent item at the top.  
**Carbon:** You should add documents to this submenu when they are opened or saved. **Cocoa:** The Open Recent submenu is populated automatically.  
<span id="page-88-2"></span>**Close (Command-W).** Closes the active window. When the user chooses this command and the active document has been changed since last saved, display the Save Changes alert (see ["Dialogs for](#page-142-0) [Saving, Closing, and Quitting"](#page-142-0) (page 143)). When the user presses the Option key, Close changes to Close All. The keyboard shortcuts Command-W and Command-Option-W should implement the Close and Close All commands, respectively. The Close command and Command-W should not close utility windows.  
<span id="page-88-4"></span>**Close File (Command-Shift-W).** In a file-based application that supports multiple views of the same file, you can include a Close File command below Close Window to close a file and all its associated windows. If possible, include the filename in the menu (for example, Close File "Jerry's Kids").  
**Save (Command-S).** Saves the active document, leaves the document open, and provides feedback indicating that the document is being (or has been) saved. If the document has not previously been saved, display a Save dialog (see ["Save Dialogs"](#page-142-1) (page 143)).  
<span id="page-89-5"></span>**Save As (Command-Shift-S).** Displays the Save dialog, which allows the user to save a copy of the active document with a new user-defined name, a new location, or both. The newly saved document remains open and active.  
<span id="page-89-11"></span>**Note:** Avoid using Save a Copy or Save To commands. Users might not understand the distinction between them and Save As.  
<span id="page-89-7"></span><span id="page-89-6"></span>**Save All.** Saves changes to all open documents.  
<span id="page-89-3"></span>**Revert to Saved.** Discards all changes made to the active document since the last time it was saved or opened. When the user chooses Revert to Saved, display an alert that warns the user about the potential data loss the operation will cause.  
<span id="page-89-8"></span><span id="page-89-4"></span>**Print (Command-P).** Opens the standard Print dialog, which allows users to print to a printer, to send a fax, or to save as a PDF file. For more information, see ["The Printing Dialogs"](#page-150-0) (page 151).  
<span id="page-89-0"></span>**Page Setup (Command-Shift-P).** Opens a dialog for specifying printing parameters such as paper size and printing orientation. These parameters are saved with the document.
