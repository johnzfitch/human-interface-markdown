The *Apple PublicationsStyle Guide* covers style and usage issues, and is thekeyreference for howApple uses language. This document is available in the User Experience Reference Library; consult itwhenever you have a question about the preferred style of particular terms.  
For issues that aren't covered in the *Apple Publications Style Guide*, Apple recommends three other works: *The American Heritage Dictionary,The Chicago Manual of Style,* and *Words Into Type*. When these books give conflicting rules, *The Chicago Manual of Style* takes precedence for questions of usage and *The American Heritage Dictionary* for questions of spelling.  
The rest of this section discusses specific details of how to present your text in a style that integrates properly with the Aqua user interface.
