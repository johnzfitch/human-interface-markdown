#### **Buttons**

Buttons are the primary controls for setting a state or initiating an application action. They're used for the controls in title bars (the miniaturize and close buttons), for Cancel and the other choices that dismiss attention panels, and in most other situations where a basic control device is called for.

Buttons can assume a variety of different shapes and sizes, some of them standard. The figure below shows the standard types of buttons.
