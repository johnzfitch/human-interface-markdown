The Newton system includes online help for built-in applications and system services. Users can see the online system help by tapping the How Do I? button in the Assist slip. When a user taps that button, the system displays an outline-like overview of help topics. Tapping a topic expands the outline to display that topic's subtopics or, if that topic has no subtopics, to display instructions for that topic. Although you cannot add to the built-in help, you can provide the same kind of help within your Newton application. Figure 8-25 shows the built-in help overview.

<span id="page-270-0"></span>Users can also access the built-in help by choosing Help from the Info picker in any built-in application. When accessed through an Info picker, the help overview appears with the appropriate outline topic already expanded. Likewise, your application gives users access to its online help through its Info picker (see ["Info Picker" on page 4-24\)](#page-149-0).  
Another method of accessing online help is through the Extras Drawer. The built-in help is a digital help book that is customarily filed in the Help folder of the Extras Drawer. A user can open the built-in online help by tapping the Help icon there. You can give users the same access to your application's online help by making it a digital help book in the Extras Drawer. For more information on digital help books, see *Newton Book Maker User's Guide*.  
The purpose of online help is to provide quick access to single screens of step-by-step instructions for performing actions in a Newton application. If you add online help to your application, keep the following points in mind:  
- Organize your online help so users can't get lost in it.
- Make help information short, since the help view doesn't scroll and probably never will. The system truncates help information that exceeds the length of the help view.
- Keep each help page simple, specific, and task-oriented.
- Phrase each overview topic and subtopic so it grammatically completes a question that begins "How do I?" For example, the topic "Use the Shopping List Application" asks the question "How Do I Use the Shopping List Application?" Under this topic could be subtopics such as "Add Items to the Shopping List" and "Check Off Purchased Items." Do not begin a topic or subtopic with a gerund, such as "Using," or the topic will not mesh grammatically with the "How do I?" question.  
Online help is not intended to provide a full user manual. If you want to create an online user manual in a large view with multiple-font text and on-screen controls for content navigation, make it a regular Newton digital book (not a digital help book). For information on making digital books, see *Newton Book Maker User's Guide*.
