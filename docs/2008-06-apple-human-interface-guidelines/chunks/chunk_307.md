**Control sizes**: Capsule-style toolbar controls are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. You should use regular-size capsule-style toolbar controls by default, but you should also provide small versions of the controls so users can customize the toolbar.  
If you use system-provided imagesin a capsule-style toolbar control, you don't have to worry about changing the width of the control to accommodate its contents. If you provide a custom icon, be sure to avoid extending it into the end-cap space of the control.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Labels for capsule-style toolbar controls should be in the system font appropriate for the size of the control (these fonts are automatically supplied by Interface Builder):  
- Regular size: System font.
- Small: Small system font.
- Mini: Mini system font.  
**Control spacing**: There should be 8 pixels between separate capsule-style toolbar controls. Note that this happens automatically, and that this spacing can change depending on the length of the external label.
