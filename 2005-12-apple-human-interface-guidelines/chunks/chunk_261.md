A **sheet** is a modal dialog attached to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog applies to. Because a sheet is attached to the window from which it emerges, a sheet does not have its own title.  
The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window helps users take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model (see ["Window Layering"](#page-189-1) (page 190)). Sheets also allow users to perform other tasks before dismissing the dialog, with no sense of the system being "hijacked" by the application.

**Carbon:** You are responsible for creating, showing, handling the events for, and closing sheets. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when the sheet appears and is dismissed, is handled automatically by the Window Manager.  
**Cocoa:** You are responsible for loading, showing, and closing sheets. While a sheet is displayed, events are handled by the Application Kit just as for any other window. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when the sheet appears and is dismissed, is handled automatically by the Application Kit.
