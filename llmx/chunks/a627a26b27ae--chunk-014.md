<!-- Chunk 14 | Source: 1986-07 Human Interface Guidelines (Second Beta Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 938 -->
People are extremely complex and varied. A theory of human existence that would provide a framework for the design of human—computer interaction seems a long way off. It would be oversimplified anyway, because computers themselves change the way people think, feel, and behave. Computer design and human activity will therefore evolve together. But if computer designers avoid making sound models for human—computer interaction, there can be no evolution in the field. If a designer is to provide a consistent world that a person can enter with ease and effectiveness, it is important to have a specific model of how people behave.  
The Apple Desktop Interface represents the result of a great deal of concern with the human part of human—computer interaction. It has been designed explicitly to enhance the effectiveness of people. This approach has frequently been labeled "user friendly," though "user reasonable" is probably more appropriate. It has been thought of as the ideal interface for beginners, though it would be more useful to think of it as good for people in general. It has been labeled "simple," though "direct" and "effective" make more sense. And it has been described as "easy to learn," though "accessible by humans" would be as true.  
The following sections discuss the differences between these contrasting descriptions, and describe the Apple Desktop Interface in the context of the model of human—computer interaction that it assumes.
