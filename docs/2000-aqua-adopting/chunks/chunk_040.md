Mac OS X reserves two key combinations as new equivalents to menu commands that affect all applications:  
- Command-H is reserved as an equivalent to the "Hide <appname>" menu command that appears in the Application menu of all applications.
- Command-M is reserved as an equivalent to the "Minimize Window" menu command that appears in the Window menu. It applies to any active window that can be minimized.
