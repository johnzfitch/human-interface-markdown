Encourage people to explore your application by building in forgiveness—that is, making most actions easily reversible. People need to feel that they can try things without damaging the system or jeopardizing their data. Create safety nets,such asthe Undo and Revert to Saved commands,so that people will feel comfortable learning and using your product.  
Warn users when they initiate a task that will cause irreversible loss of data. If alerts appear frequently, however, it may mean that the product has some design flaws. When options are presented clearly and feedback is timely, using an application should be relatively error-free.  
Anticipate common problems and alert users to potential side effects. Provide extensive feedback and communication at every stage so users feel that they have enough information to make the right choices. For an overview of different types of feedback you can provide, see "Feedback and [Communication"](#page-41-1) (page 42).
