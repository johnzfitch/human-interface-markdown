# #9. Dialog & Alert Update

By: Annette Wagner & Katie Withey

Date: 31 March 87

This information will be in the final version of Human Interface Guidelines: the Apple Desktop Interface (to be published by Addison Wesley)

Centering dialogs & alerts

Most dialogs and alerts should be centered in the upper third of the screen, whatever size screen they are displayed on. If a dialog or alert exists in a particular "zone" in the screen, then center it within that zone.

The exception to this is a dialog or alert whose placement is linked to something else on the screen, such as a dialog that appears with its default button in the same place as the menu item that brought up the dialog, allowing the user to click the button without moving the mouse.

Dialog layout & default buttons

In general, dialogs should be laid out with the most important information and controls at the top left, working down to the less important information, ending with the default button—the button most likely to be clicked—in the lower right. In Western countries, people are used to reading and writing from left to right, and top to bottom, so this is the most natural way to fill in information.
