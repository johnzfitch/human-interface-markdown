Responsiveness is how users measure the performance of your software. Your app might use the best data-processing algorithms and performance-boosting techniques available, but if it does not instantly respond to the user, it will seem slow. During app development, pay attention to both the factors that influence the user's perceptions and the actual, measurable performance metrics that your app generates.  
**Instantly acknowledge the user's commands and input.** Users expect to receive some type of feedback every time they interact with your app (for more on the principle of feedback, see ["Feedback](#page-30-1) and [Communication"](#page-30-1) (page 31)). For example, buttons highlight when users click them and the pointer changes appropriately as users move it over different controls and areas. Similarly, if a command can't be carried out, users want to know why it can't and what they can do instead. The quicker you provide feedback for the user's interactions, the more responsive your app appears.  
**Don't wait until a long task completes before you display any results to users.** If you display nothing until you have all the results, users might interpret this as sluggishness. Instead, display partial results as soon as possible after users initiate a long task so that they have something useful to view while the rest of the task completes.  
**Use a progress indicator to help users gauge how long a process will take to complete.** Users don't always need to know precisely how long a task will take, but it's important to give them an estimate. For example, the Finder combines a progress indicator with optional explanatory text to show users about how long a copy operation will take.

To learn about the types of progress indicators you can use, see "Progress [Indicators"](#page-274-1) (page 275).  
**Follow performance best practices.** For example, avoid polling for information or events, load resourceslazily, minimize drive accesses, and eliminate unnecessary I/O operations. To learn how to develop a performant Mac app, start by reading *Performance Overview*.  
**Use metrics and tools to tune the performance of your app throughout development.** Be sure to use metrics, not assumptions, to quantify the performance of your app before you begin trying to improve it. For example, you can use Instruments (which is part of Xcode) to help you identify and address performance issues in your code. To learn more about Instruments, see *Instruments User Guide* .
