#### Style Menu

Plain text Bold Italic Underline Apple-P Apple-B Apple-I Apple-U

There is a keyboard operation that has no menu equivalent It is Escape, or Apple-period, which can be used to stop the current operation.

Several other menu features are also supported:

- A menu item can be shown in Bold, Italic, Outline, Underline, or Shadow character style. This should be done only in the style menu, to illustrate the text styles.
- A menu item can be preceded by a special character such as .y or •. Icons can also appear in menus, but because of their size they require two lines.
- Applications can have special kinds of menus for special situations-for example, MacDraw's Fill menu.
