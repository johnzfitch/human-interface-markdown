Three standard Macintosh menus affect the appearance of text: Font, which determines the font of a text selection; FontSize, which determines the size of the characters; and Style, which determines aspects of its appearance such as boldface, italics, and so on.  
Because of the proliferation of printers on the Apple II family, you may find it too expensive to implement the kind of power and range of font options available on the Macintosh. We have still including the full specification; use that portion necessary for your particular application.

If there's insufficient room in the menu bar for the word FontSize, it can be abbreviated to Size. If there's insufficient room for both a Font menu and a Size menu, the sizes can be put at the end of the Font or Style menu.
