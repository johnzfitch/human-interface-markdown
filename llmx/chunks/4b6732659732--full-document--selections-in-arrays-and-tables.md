#### Selections in Arrays and Tables

An array is a one- or two-dimensional arrangement of fields. The user can select one or more fields, or part of the contents of a field.

To select a single field, the user clicks in the field (Figure 12). The user can also select a field by moving into it with the Tab or Return key.

Figure 12. Field Selection in an Array

To select part of the contents of a field, the user must first select the field. The user then clicks again to select the desired part of the field. Because the contents of a field are either text or graphics, this type of selection follows the rules outlined above.

A table can also support selection of rows and columns. The most convenient way for the user to select a column is to click in the column header. To select more than one column, the user drags through several column headers. The same applies to rows.

Figures 13, 14, and 15 show column, range, and discontinuous selections in arrays.

Figure 15. Discontinuous Selection in an Array

The Tab key cycles through the fields in an order determined by the application. From each field, the Tab key selects the "next" field. Typically, the sequence of fields is first from left to right, and then from top to bottom. When the last field in a form is selected, pressing the Tab key selects the first field in the form. If there's a good reason, an application may guide the user through the fields in some order other than the order in which the fields appear on the screen.

The Return key selects the first field in the next row. If the idea of rows doesn't make sense in a particular context, then the Return key should have the same effect as the Tab key.
