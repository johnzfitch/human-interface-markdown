#### Copy  
Before the user can copy something, she must first select it. Copy puts a duplicate of the selection in the Clipboard, but the selection also remains in the document. The user can then choose Paste to insert the Clipboard's contents somewhere else.  
The Apple-C key combination is reserved as a keyboard substitute for Copy in the Edit menu and should be used for no other purpose.
