Logically grouping menu items is the most important aspect of arranging your menus. Grouping items in a menu makes it easier to quickly locate commands for related tasks.  
In general, place the most frequently used items at the top of the menu, but create groups of related items rather than arranging them strictly by frequency of use. For example, although the Find Next or the Find Again command may be used infrequently, it should appear right below the Find command. In a menu that contains both actions and attributes, don't put actions and attributes in the same group.  
If your application allowsthe creation ofsmart data groups or containers,such as a smart folder in the Finder, group all commands related to the smart group in the same menu. In other words, commands for creating, modifying, and destroying a smart group should all be in the same menu.  
Group interdependent attributes. They can be in a **mutually exclusive attribute group** (the user can select only one item, such as font size) or an **accumulating attribute group** (the user can select multiple items, such as Bold and Italic).  
If a menu repeats a term more than twice, consider dedicating a menu or hierarchical menu to the term instead. For example, if you need commands like Show Info, Show Colors, Show Layers, Show Toolbox, and so on, you could create a Show menu or a submenu off of a Show item.  
How many separators to use is partly an aesthetic decision and partly a usability decision. Figure 13-10 shows a menu that depictsthe right balance of grouping, contrasted with two menusshowing insufficient grouping and too much grouping. Use this picture as a visual guide when trying to decide how many separators to use in your menus.

<span id="page-173-3"></span><span id="page-173-0"></span>Hierarchical Menus (Submenus)  
You can use **hierarchical menus** to offer additional menu item choices without taking up more space in the menu bar. When the user points to a menu item with a submenu indicator, a submenu appears. Submenus have all the features of menus, including keyboard shortcuts, status markers (such as checkmarks), and so on.  
Because submenus add complexity to the interface and are physically more difficult to use, you should use them only when you have more menus than fit in the menu bar or for closely related commands. Use only *one level* of submenus. If a submenu contains more than five items, consider giving it its own menu.  
When you use submenus, include them in a menu with a logical relationship to the choices they contain; the submenu title should clearly represent the choicesit contains. Hierarchical menus work best for providing submenus of attributes (rather than actions).  
Always use a hierarchical menu instead of indenting menu items. Indentation does not express the interrelationships among menu items as clearly as a submenu does. You can, however, use indentation when displaying custom information (such as status information) in your application's Dock menu. See [Figure](#page-189-1) [13-25](#page-189-1) (page 190) for an example of an application Dock menu. Figure 13-11 shows an example of a hierarchical menu.

As with menu titles, a submenu's title is displayed unchanged even if all of the submenu's commands are unavailable (dimmed) at the same time. Users should always be able to view a submenu's contents, whether or not they are available in the current context.
