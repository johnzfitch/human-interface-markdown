## Visual Consistency

Visual consistency means that "what you see is what you get." Its purpose is to construct a consistent and believable environment for users (in this case a desktop environment). Users can easily transfer their skills from a real desktop to the computer desktop. This transfer of skills is one of the most important benefits of a good interface, especially for beginning users. Since concepts like storing documents in folders and throwing things away in the trash are the same in both the real world environment and the desktop environment, users do not have to re-learn these in order to begin to work.

The principle of visual consistency is the foundation for the design of the graphics on the screen. Things look like what they represent. Icons are the best example of this. Most icons represent items normally found in offices—documents, folders, and trash cans. Whenever possible, the icons on the screen should look like familiar objects. Further, the appearance of an icon should suggest its function. For example, if the icon looks like a trash can, it should also function like a trash can, and you should be able to throw things away in it. (Application icons for the most part do not have a counterpart in the real world; they rely on the context of the environment to be understood.)

Photographic realism is not essential. The important thing is that the user gets the intended meaning. A caricature often does this better than a completely realistic picture.

If two objects function differently, it's important that they look different. There are certainly times when something does not have a real world equivalent, like databases or program files; in this case a symbol that conveys the basic concept can be tested on users.

If images don't efficiently convey meaning, the user is lost in an environment of random objects, and communication breaks down. Remember the principle of a friendly dialog between the user and the computer. Graphics—the icons, windows, dialog boxes, and so on—are the basis of this dialog and must be designed with this in mind.
