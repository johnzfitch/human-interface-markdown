The idea is for users to bring up a submenu, then tear it off and move it to a desired location if they want it to stay on-screen. Once a submenu has been tom away from its supermenu, it stays where the user puts it. To reattach the submenu, the user must close it and then choose its controlling command.  
If the user presses the mouse button while the cursor is over the command that controls the tom-off submenu, a copy of the submenu temporarily appears next to its supermenu.
