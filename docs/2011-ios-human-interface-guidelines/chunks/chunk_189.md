As with all standard buttons and icons, it's essential to use the tab bar icons in accordance with their documented meanings. In particular, take care to base your usage of an icon on its semantic meaning, not its appearance. This will help your application's user interface make sense even if the icon associated with a specific meaning changes its appearance. For further reasons why it's important to use these icons correctly, see "Use UI Elements [Consistently"](#page-54-1) (page 55).
