<!-- Chunk 14 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 239 -->
An open folder may be moved by placing the cursor on its title tab, and then pressing and holding down the mouse button while moving the cursor. A flickering outline of the entire folder will track the cursor. Releasing the mouse button moves the folder instantaneously to the new position indicated by the flickering outline.  
A closed folder may also be moved by dragging its title tab. The process is the same as for an open folder except that no flickering outline is given and instead of the jump at the end, the whole tab is dragged along continuously with the cursor until the button is released.  
The open and closed locations of a folder are independent. Dragging a closed folder changes only its closed position, and dragging an open folder changes only its open position.  
Since pressing the mouse button on any part of a folder makes it the active folder, moving a folder leaves it active and on top of any other folders that it might overlap.
