The mouse is a small device the size of a deck of playing cards, connected to the computer by a long, flexible cable. There's a button on the top of the mouse. The user holds the mouse and rolls it on a flat, smooth surface. A pointer on the screen follows the motion of the mouse.  
Simply moving the mouse results only in a corresponding movement of the pointer and no other action. Most actions take place when the user positions the "hot spot" of the pointer over an object on the screen and presses and releases the mouse button. The hot spot should be intuitive, like the point of an arrow or the center of a crossbar.
