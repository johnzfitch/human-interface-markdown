Mac OS X version 10.4 introduced Dashboard, a way for users to get information and perform simple tasks quickly and easily. Appearing and disappearing with a single keystroke or mouse gesture, Dashboard presents a default or user-defined set of widgets in a format reminiscent of a heads-up display. Each widget is small, visually appealing, and clearly indicative of its purpose. For example, each of the Mac OS X Dashboard widgets shown in [Figure](#page-65-0) 5-4 (page 66) is an attractive, scaled-down interface to a common task.

You can develop a standalone widget that performs a lightweight, well-defined task or a widget whose taskis actually performed byyourlarger, more functional application. This section summarizes both the high-level and user-interface guidelines you should follow as you design your widget. Step-by-step instructions for how to implement a Dashboard widget are available in *Dashboard Programming Guide*.  
<span id="page-65-1"></span>Many of the user-interface design principles covered in "Human [Interface](#page-30-0) Design" (page 31) are also applicable to Dashboard widgets. Following these guidelines gives users an automatic familiarity with this technology.  
Dashboard widgets are small and compact in part because they occupy prime screen space but also because they convey a sense of performing a single task well. As you design your widget, keep these high-level guidelines in mind:  
- A widget's purpose should be immediately apparent to the user.
- Thewidget's front-side capabilityshould be entirelyfocused on its taskand require no explanation or configuration. If necessary,you can use the backof thewidget to capture the user's preferences.
- A widget is not the place to display aggressive company advertising or branding. Your widget is not an entrance to another application, even if that other application performs the processing for the widget's task. If you take advantage of Dashboard's prominence to display a banner ad, for example, users will be likely to stop including your widget in the Dashboard display.  
■ A widget is not simply a miniaturized version of a standard application window. Avoid making your widget look crowded by displaying only the controls that are essential to the task.  
As with the design of a full-size application, take the time to carefully define your target audience (see ["Involving](#page-24-1) Users in the Design Process" (page 25) for tips on how to do this). Focus on a single task your widget should perform; don't try to provide solutions that are extraneous to this central task. Read "Making Design [Decisions"](#page-27-0) (page 28) for guidelines that apply equally to Dashboard widgets and standard applications. Determine the user's mental model of the task your Dashboard widget performs. Because a Dashboard widget should clearly convey its purpose to the user, it is essential to accurately mirror the user's mental model (for more information on this concept, see ["Reflect](#page-31-0) the User's Mental Model " (page 32)).  
When you've decided on the widget's task, follow these guidelines for designing the user interface:  
- Use color to enhance the visual impact of your widget. Widgets should be visually stimulating, and good color choices can help conveythe type of taskthewidget performs. Aswith application icons (described in "Icon Genres and [Families"](#page-122-1) (page 123)), you should consider using bright, saturated colors for fun, creative tasks and more sombre, desaturated colors for utilitarian tasks.
- If appropriate, provide a way for the user to set a few options on the back of the widget. If you need to do this, display an Info button in the lower right quadrant of the widget (for information on how to provide this control, see *Dashboard Programming Guide*).
- Use a more subdued version of your color scheme on the back of the widget. This helps the user distinguish the widget's back from its front.
- Provide a Done button on the back of your widget that allows users to return to the front of the widget (for more information on how to provide this control, see *Dashboard Programming Guide*).
- Don't use Aqua controls on the front of your widget. Instead, design controls that support and enhance the task-oriented appearance of the widget.
- Display the widget's information at once. Dashboard appears and disappears quickly, so you don't want to make the user wait for your content to display.
- The default size of the widget should be small, but it should be able to expand if the task requires it. Avoid providing a resize control; if a user misses this control and clicks outside the widget, Dashboard is hidden.
- Be aware that a user might want to populate the Dashboard with a very large number of widgets. Ifyourwidget is too large and seems to monopolize the screen, a user might choose not to include it.
- The default set of information your widget displays should be minimal and should not require scrolling. If, however, the widget's function is to provide a lot of information, consider making the presence of a scroll bar an option the user can select.
- Use clearlyreadable fonts. Avoid sacrificingreadabilityto achieve a particular appearance.Focus on building the widget's personality into the contours and the controls you design.
