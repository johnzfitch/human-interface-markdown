Inputting information takes users' time and attention, whether they tap controls or use the keyboard. If your application requires a lot of user input before anything useful happens, itslows users down and can discourage them from persevering with it.  
Of course, you often need some information from users, but you should balance this with what you offer them in return. In other words, strive to provide as much information or functionality as possible for each piece of information users provide. That way, users feel they are making progress and are not being delayed as they move through your application.  
When you ask for input from users, consider using a type of table view (or a picker) instead of text fields. It's usually easier for users to select an item from a list than to type words. For details on table views and pickers, see "Table [Views"](#page-88-1) (page 89) and ["Pickers"](#page-113-0) (page 114), respectively.
