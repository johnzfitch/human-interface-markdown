A **bottom bar** is a window-frame area that is below the window body. Bottom bars give users access to controls that directly affect the contents or organization of the window body.  
In general, controls in a bottom bar are frequently used, but are somewhat less important than controls in a toolbar. For example, the bottom-bar controls in iChat allow users to add buddies to the list and to text message, call, or video chat with a selected buddy, whereas the controls in the toolbar are focused on the user of the application. Figure 14-25 shows the iChat bottom bar.
