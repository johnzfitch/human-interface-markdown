## Character keys

Character keys include keys for letters, numbers, and punctuation, as well as the Space bar. If the user presses one of these keys while entering text, the corresponding character is added to the text. The Enter, Tab, Return, Backspace, and Clear keys are also treated like character keys; while the result of pressing one of these keys depends on the application and the context, it is essential that they be used consistently, as described in the following paragraphs.
