<span id="page-73-4"></span>If your program supports typography and text layout using user-selectable fonts, you should use the Fonts window to obtain the user's font selection. Users can select fonts and sizes in both the standard (Figure 6-5) and the minimized (Figure 6-6) view of the Fonts window. In the standard view, there are also controls for fine-tuning the display characteristics of fonts. Most important, the Fonts window is implemented for you. You do not have to create a Fonts menu or other special user interface to display and gather font information from the user.

The Fonts window also provides advanced typography controls for fonts that support those options. The user can open a Typography inspector by choosing Typography from the action menu. Figure 6-7 shows the typography controls for the Zapfino font.
