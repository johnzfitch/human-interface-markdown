It's likely that people will use other Newton software besides yours—at the least they will use some of the built-in applications and services. You can turn this likelihood to your advantage by designing your application's interface to be consistent with other Newton applications. Both you and your application's users benefit if they can build on prior experience when learning how to use your application.  
<span id="page-31-0"></span>You can make your application consistent visually and behaviorally by incorporating standard Newton interface elements in it. Visual consistency helps people learn and then easily recognize the graphic language of the interface. For example, users learn to recognize a black diamond as the source of a pop-up list of choices. Behavioral consistency of the interface means people only have to learn once how to do things such as erasing and scrolling. Then they can explore new functions and applications using the skills they already have.
