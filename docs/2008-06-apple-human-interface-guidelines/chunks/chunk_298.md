As described in "Window [Appearance"](#page-187-0) (page 188), the window frame consists of the title bar, toolbar, and bottom-bar areas, and the window body is between the toolbar–title bar area and the bottom bar (if there is one). A small subset of Mac OS X controls are intended for use only in the window-frame areas, because they have been specially designed to look good on the window-frame surface. *These controls should not be used anywhere in the window body*. Conversely, all other controls available in Mac OS X can be used in the window body, and most should not be used in the window-frame areas.  
Of the controls that are designed for use in the window body, there are three that can also be used in window-frame areas:  
- Icon buttons (including icon buttons that contain a pop-up menu)—see "Icon [Buttons"](#page-260-0) (page 261) and "Icon [Buttons](#page-278-0) and Bevel Buttons with Pop-Up Menus" (page 279) for more information.
- Action menus—see "Action [Menus"](#page-283-0) (page 284) for more information.
- Search fields—see ["Search](#page-316-0) Fields" (page 317) for more information.  
Thissection describesthe controlsthat are designed solely for use in the window-frame areas. If your window contains a toolbar or bottom bar, be sure to use only the controlsthat are appropriate for each area, including icon buttons, Action menus, and search fields, as needed.
