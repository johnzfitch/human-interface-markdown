Of all the windows that are open on the desktop, the user can work in only one window at a time. This window is called the active window. All other open windows are inactive. Things can be happening to documents in inactive windows, but the user can work only with the active window. For example, if the user chooses Close from the File menu, only the active window is closed.  
To make a window active, the user clicks anywhere in it. Making a window active has two immediate consequences:  
- The window changes its appearance. Its title bar is highlighted. The scroll bars, close box, zoom window box, and size box appear.
- The window "moves" to the frontmost plane, so that parts that had been covered by other windows become visible.  
Clicking in an inactive window does nothing except activate it. To make a selection within the window, the user must click again. When the user clicks in a window that has been deactivated, the window should be reinstated just the way it was when it was deactivated, with the scroll box in the same position and the same selection highlighted.  
When a window becomes inactive, the visual changes that took pl.ace when it was activated are reversed. The title bar becomes unhighlighted. The scroll bars, close box, zoom window box, and size box disappear. Although the information within the window remains visible (except where obscured by other windows), any selection i3 deselected. Figure 39 shows the vis~al difference between active and inactive windows.  
#### Moving a Window  
Although each application has its own way to initially place windows on the screen, the user can move an active window—to make more room on the desktop or to uncover a window it's overlapping—simply by dragging it by its title bar. A dotted outline of the window follows the pointer until the user releases the mouse button. At the release of the button the full window is redrawn in its new location. Moving a window doesn't affect the appearance of the document within the window; the document moves right along with the window.  
The act of moving an inactive window makes it active—unless the user holds down the Apple key while moving the inactive window, in which case the window moves, in the same plane, without becoming active.  
The application should ensure that a window can never be moved completely off the screen.  
#### Changing the Size of a Window  
If a window has a size box in its bottom right corner, where the scroll bars come together, the user can change the size of the window—enlarging or reducing it to the desired size.  
Dragging the size box attaches a dotted outline of the window to the pointer. The outline's top left corner stays fixed, while the bottom right corner follows the pointer. When the mouse button is released, the entire window is redrawn in the shape of the dotted outline.  
If a window can be moved, but not resized, then the user ends up constantly moving windows on and off the screen. If the user moves the window off the right or bottom edge of the screen, the scroll bars are the first things to disappear. To scroll the window, the user must move the window back onto the screen again. If, on the other hand, the window can be resized, then the user can change its size instead of moving it off the screen, and still be able to scroll.  
Resizing a window doesn't change the position of the top left corner of the window over the document or the appearance of the part of the view that's still showing; it changes only how much of the view is visible inside the window. One exception to this rule is a command such as Reduce to Fit in MacDraw, which changes the scaling of the view to fit the size of the window. If, after choosing this command, the user resizes the window, the application changes the scaling of the view.  
Applications determine the minimum and maximum window size, which schould depend on the physical size of the display. If the tries to shrink the window below its minimum size, the attempt is ignored.  
#### Window Zooming  
The more open documents on a desktop, the more difficult it is for the user to locate, select, and resize the one to be worked on. Some Apple computers have a feature in ROM that allows users—with a single mouse click in the window's **zoom window box**—to drag and size the active window to a size and location they select, and then to return the window to full size with another click. If this feature is present, the zoom window box (shown in Figure 40) is present at the right end of the window's title bar. Because window zooming  
#### *Hwnan Inteiface Guidelines*  
is not available on all Apple computers, application programs must check the ROM and, if the feature is not present, bypass it. Note also that window zooming does not involve the variable magnification you get with a zoom lens).  
Application developers are encouraged to use the zoom window function on systems that make it available. The application should neither modify the shape or interpretation of clicking on the zoom window box nor build additional icons in the title bar.

Figure 41. Window in User-Selected State  
The application detennines the standard state of the window. This is generally the full screen, or close to it, and should be the size and location best suited to working on the document. As often as they want, users can specify the user-selected state of the window, generally the size and location best suited to organizing the desktop so that documents can be found and selected.  
The application program supplies values for the size and location of the window's standard state as well as the initial values for the size and location of the user-selected state. The standard state should be the most useful size and location for normal operations within the program-usually the full screen. If the application doesn't supply a standard state, the full screen (minus a few border pixels) is assumed.  
The user can't change the standard size and location, but the application can change it within context. For example, a word processor might defme the standard size and location as wide enough to display a document whose width is specified in the Page Setup dialog. If the user invokes Page Setup to specify a wider or narrower document, the application might change the values for the standard size and location to reflect that change.  
Explicit dragging or resizing of the window is handled according to these guidelines, regardless of the presence or absence of the zoom window feature. The effect of dragging or resizing depends on the state of the window and the degree of movement. In the  
Macintosh computer, the user must drag or resize a window at least seven pixels to cause a change in the user-selected state.  
#### Scroll Bars  
Scroll bars are used to change which part of a document view is shown in a window. Only the active window can be scrolled.  
A scroll bar is a light gray rectangle having on each end an arrow in a square box. A window can have either a vertical scroll bar or a horizontal scroll bar, or both. Vertical scroll bars are on the right side of the associated window; horizontal scroll bars run along the bottom of the window. Inside the scroll bar is a white rectangle called the scroll box. The rest of the scroll bar is the gray area.

Figure 42. Vertical Scroll Bar  
A scroll bar represents one dimension (either top to bottom or left to right) of the entire document. The scroll box represents the relative location, in the whole document, of the portion currently seen in the window. The insertion point is linked to the scroll box. If the user "moves" the document by clicking either a scroll arrow or in the gray area, the scroll box moves along with it. If the user drags the scroll box, the document "moves" along with it. If the document is no larger than the window, the scroll bars are inactive (the scrolling apparatus isn't shown in them). If the document window is inactive, the scroll bars aren't shown at all.  
There are three ways to move the document under the window: by sequential scrolling, by "paging" windowful by windowful through the document, and by dragging the scroll box. To experience these first hand, try them out in an application such as MacWrite.
