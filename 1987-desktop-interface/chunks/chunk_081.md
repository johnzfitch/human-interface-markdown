Because—in the Apple Desktop Interface—the pointing device is used for pointing and manipulating, users don't have to use the keyboard to type commands. The keyboard is used primarily for entering text.  
The standard keys on the keyboard are arranged in familiar typewriter fashion. Because keyboards vary from one computer to another, no specific keyboard isillustrated here.  
There are two kinds of keys: character keys and modifier keys. A character key sends characters to the computer. When held down, <sup>a</sup> modifier key can alter the meaning of the character key being pressed, or alter or amplify the meaning of a mouse action.
