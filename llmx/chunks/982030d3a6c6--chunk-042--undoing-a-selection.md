#### Undoing a Selection  
When a block of text is selected, pressing either Left Arrow or Right Arrow deselects the range. If Left Arrow is pressed, the insertion point goes to the beginning of what had been the selection. If Right Arrow is used, the insertion point goes to the end of what had been the selection.
