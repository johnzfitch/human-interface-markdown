The pointer may change shape to give feedback on the range of activities that make sense in a particular area of the screen, in a current mode, or both.  
- The result of any mouse action depends on the item under the pointer when the mouse button is pressed. To emphasize the differences among mouse actions, the pointer may assume different appearances in different areas to indicate the actions possible in each area.
- Where an application uses modes for different functions, the pointer can be a different shape in each mode. For example, in MousePaint, the pointer shape always reflects the active palette symbol.  
Figure 5 shows some examples of pointers and their effect. An application can design additional pointers for other contexts.
