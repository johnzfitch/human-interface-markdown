The user can select a range of some objects by following this procedure:  
- 1. The user positions the pointer at one corner of the range and presses the mouse button. This position is called the **anchor point** of the range.
- 2. Without releasing the mouse button, the user moves the pointer in any direction.
- As the pointer moves, visual feedback indicates the objects that would be selected if the mouse button is released.Fortext and arrays, the selected area is continuously highlighted.Forgraphics, a dotted rectangle expands or contracts to show the selected area. If appropriate, the view should scroll to allow extending the selection beyond a window.
- 3. When the desired range is selected, the user releases the mouse button. The point at which the button is released is called the **active end** of the range.
