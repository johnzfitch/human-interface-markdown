A date and time picker can have up to four independent wheels, each of which displays values in a single category, such as month or hour. Users flick or drag to spin each wheel until it displays the desired value beneath the clear selection bar that stretches across the middle of the picker. The final value comprises the values displayed in each wheel.  
The overall size of a date and time picker is fixed at the same size as the iPhone keyboard.  
A date and time picker has four modes, each of which displays a different number of wheels that contain a set of different values.  
- **Date and time**. The date and time mode displays wheels for the calendar date, hour, and minute values, with the optional addition of a wheel for the AM/PM designation. This is the default mode.
- **Time**. The time mode displays wheels for the hour and minute values, with the optional addition of a wheel for the AM/PM designation.
- **Date**. The date mode displays wheels for the month, day, and year values.
- **Countdown timer**. The countdown timer mode displays wheelsfor the hour and minute. You can specify the total duration of a countdown, up to a maximum of 23 hours and 59 minutes.
