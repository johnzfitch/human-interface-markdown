Some Macintosh keyboards include function keys. There are two types of function keys, dedicated and nondedicated. The nondedicated function keys labeled F1 through F15—are definable by the user, *not* by the application. F1 through F4 represent Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste in any applications that use these commands.  
The six dedicated function keys are labeled Help, Del, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down. These keys are shown in Figure 10-13.
