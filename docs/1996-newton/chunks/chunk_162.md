A user may not want an e-mail transport to receive all items every time it connects, due to the length of time it would take or the amount of storage space they would occupy on the Newton device. An e-mail transport (or other transport that potentially receives numerous items from a remote source at a slow speed) can retrieve just the item headers and put them in the In Box with a status of Remote. That status tells users that the body of the item is stored remotely and has not yet been transferred to the Newton. If a user attempts to view an incomplete item in the In Box, the In Box notices the Remote status and has the appropriate transport get the remainder of the item from the remote source.
