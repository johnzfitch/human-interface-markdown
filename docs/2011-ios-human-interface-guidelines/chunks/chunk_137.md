Use a modal view when you need to offer the ability to accomplish a self-contained task related to your application's primary function. A modal view is especially appropriate for a multistep subtask that requires UI elements that don't belong in the main application user interface all the time.  
**On iPad, choose a modal view style that suits the current task and the visual style of your app**. You can use any of these styles, defined here:  
● **Full screen**. Covers the entire screen. This style is good for presenting a potentially complex task that people can complete within the context of the modal view. For example, the iPod application uses this style for its Genius playlist creation task.  
- **Page sheet**. Has a fixed width of 768 points; the sheet height is the current height of the screen. In portrait, the modal view covers the entire screen; in landscape, the screen that is visible on both sides of the modal view is dimmed to prevent user interaction. For example, Mail usesthisstyle for its message composition task.
- **Form sheet**. Has fixed dimensions of 540 x 620 points and is centered in the screen. The area of the screen that is visible outside the modal view is dimmed to prevent user interaction. When the keyboard is visible in landscape, a form sheet view moves up to just below the status bar. This style is good for gathering structured information from the user.
- **Current context**. Uses the same size as its parent view. This style is good for displaying a modal view within a split view pane, popover, or other non–full–screen view.  
**On iPad, don't display a modal view on top of a popover**. With the possible exception of an alert, nothing should display on top of a popover. In rare cases when you might need to display a modal view as a result of an action the user takes in a popover, close the popover before you open the modal view.  
**On iPhone, coordinate the overall look of a modal view with the appearance of your app**. For example, a modal view often includes a navigation bar that contains a title and buttons that cancel or complete the modal view's task. When this is the case, the navigation bar should have the same background appearance as the navigation bar in the application.  
**On both devices, display a title that identifies the task, if appropriate**. You might also display text in other areas of the view that more fully describes the task or provides some guidance. For example, the Messages app on iPhone presents a modal view when users want to compose a text message. This modal view displays a navigation bar with the same background asthe application navigation bar and with the title New Message.

**On both devices, choose an appropriate transition style for revealing the modal view**. Use a style that coordinates with your application and enhances the user's awareness of the temporary context shift that the modal view represents. To do this, you can specify one of the following transition styles:  
- **Vertical**. The modal view slides up from the bottom edge of the screen and slides back down when dismissed. (This is the default transition style.)
- **Flip**. The current view flips horizontally from right to left to reveal the modal view. Visually, the modal view looks as if it is the back of the current view. When the modal view is dismissed, it flips horizontally from left to right, revealing the previous view.
- **Partial curl**. The partial-curl transition style issimilar to the page-curl behavior of Maps on iPhone. Visually, one corner of the current view curls up to reveal the modal view underneath. When the user leaves the modal view, the current view uncurls to its original position. You might want to use this style when the modal view you reveal is not large and does not require much user interaction, such as a view that holds configuration options.  
Note that a modal view revealed by a partial-curl transition cannot itself reveal another modal view.  
If you decide to vary the transition styles of the modal views in your application, avoid doing so merely for the sake of variety. Users are quick to notice such differences and will assume that they mean something. For this reason, it's best to establish a logical, consistent pattern that users can easily detect and remember, and avoid changing transition styles without a good reason.
