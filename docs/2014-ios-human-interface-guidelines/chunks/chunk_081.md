- Avoid being interrupted by unexpected sounds, such as phone ringtones and incoming message sounds
- Avoid hearing sounds that are the byproducts of user actions, such as keyboard or other feedback sounds, incidental sounds, or app startup sounds
- Avoid hearing game soundsthat are not essential to using the game,such assound effects and soundtracks  
**Note:** People switch their devices to silent using either the Ring/Silent switch (on iPhone) or the Silent switch (on iPad).  
For example, in a theater users switch their devices to silent to avoid bothering other people in the theater. In this situation, users still want to be able to use apps on their devices, but they don't want to be surprised by sounds they don't expect or explicitly request, such as ringtones or new message sounds.  
The Ring/Silent (or Silent) switch does *not* silence sounds that result from user actions that are solely and explicitly intended to produce sound. For example:  
- Media playback in a media-only app is not silenced because the media playback was explicitly requested by the user.
- A Clock alarm is not silenced because the alarm was explicitly set by the user.
- A sound clip in a language-learning app is not silenced because the user took explicit action to hear it.  
● Conversation in an audio chat app is not silenced because the user started the app for the sole purpose of having an audio chat.  
**Users use the device's volume buttons to adjust the volume of all sounds their devices can play,** including songs, app sounds, and device sounds. Users can use the volume buttons to quiet any sound, regardless of the position of the Ring/Silent (or Silent) switch. Using the volume buttons to adjust an app's currently playing audio also adjusts the overall system volume, with the exception of the ringer volume.  
**iPhone:** Using the volume buttons when no audio is currently playing adjusts the ringer volume.  
**Users use headsets and headphones to hear sounds privately and to free their hands.** Regardless of whether these accessories are wired or wireless, users have specific expectations for the user experience.  
When users plug in a headset or headphones, or connect to a wireless audio device, they intend to continue listening to the current audio, but privately. For this reason, they expect an app that is currently playing audio to continue playing without pause.  
When users unplug a headset or headphones, or disconnect from a wireless device (or the device goes out of range or turns off), they don't want to automatically share what they've been listening to with others. For this reason, they expect an app that is currently playing audio to pause, allowing them to explicitly restart playback when they're ready.
