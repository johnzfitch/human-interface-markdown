You can use either table-view style to cluster information into logical groups, such as work, home, or school. Both plain and grouped tables allow you to provide context for each section by supplying header and footer text, as shown in [Figure](#page-101-0) 8-14 (page 102).

<span id="page-101-1"></span>Generally speaking, grouped tables provide a clearer visual indication of grouping because it's easy for users to distinguish the rounded corners of the groups, even when scrolling quickly. [Figure](#page-101-1) 8-15 (page 102) shows several conceptual groups of values in iPod settings.

■ **Looking up indexed information**.  
If you're using a plain table, you can display an index that helps users quickly find what they need. The index consists of a column of entries (usually letters in an alphabet) that floats on the right edge of the screen, asshown in [Figure](#page-102-1) 8-16 (page 103). Userstap (or drag to) an index entry to reveal the corresponding area in the list. An index is most useful in a list that might span more than a few screenfuls.

If you include an index in a plain table, avoid using table-view elements that display on the right edge of the table (such as the disclosure indicator), because these elements interfere with the index.
