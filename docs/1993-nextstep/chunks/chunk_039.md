If the anchor point and end point are substantially the same-as they are for a click-the user's action may sometimes select the item under the cursor and sometimes simply select that location. In a graphics editor, for example, a click can select an existing figure or a location to insert a new one.  
In text, a click always selects a location-an insertion point-where characters can be entered from the keyboard. The insertion point is normally marked by a blinking vertical bar located between characters. If the user clicks on top of a character, the insertion point is adjusted to the nearest character boundary. Clicking in a margin, or in an empty area away from any text, puts the insertion point next to the nearest character in series.
