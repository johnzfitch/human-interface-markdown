## The Help Menu

The Macintosh Operating System includes Balloon Help, an online help system for system software; you can use the Help Manager to implement Balloon Help for your application. The user can turn on Balloon Help from the Help menu. Figure 4-88 shows the Help menu.

If you provide additional help information for your application, put the help commands that you provide in the Help menu. It's a good idea to include the name of your application next to your help command. For example, you might include a command called WaveWriter Help in the Help menu.
