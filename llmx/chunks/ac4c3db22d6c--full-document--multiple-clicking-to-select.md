### **Multiple-Clicking to Select**

Although a single click selects only an insertion point in text, multiple-clicking selects characters already inserted. A multiple-click always selects a linguistically meaningful unit. Normally, double-clicking selects a word, and triple-clicking selects a paragraph (all the text between return characters).

If the user drags from a multiple-click, additional units of the same type are selected. For example, double-clicking a word selects the word; dragging from the double-click then selects every other word that's even partially within the range defined by the anchor and end points.
