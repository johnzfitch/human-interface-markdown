A **bevel button** has a beveled edge that gives the button a three-dimensional appearance.  
- Bevel buttons can display text, an icon, or a picture
- They mimic the behavior of other button types; for example, a bevel button can behave like a standard push button. Bevel buttons can be grouped and used like radio buttons or checkboxes.
- Bevel buttons can have a menu attached, so the button behaves like a pop-up menu. See ["Pop-Up Icon Buttons and Pop-Up Bevel Buttons" \(page 134\)](#page-133-1)
- They can have rounded or square corners. The square buttons work well for tiling together in groups, to be used as radio buttons, for example.
