The In Box is where a user first sees and deals with incoming faxes, e-mail, beamed items, and other data items received by Newton transport software. Users can view many types of incoming data items in detail while the items are still in the In Box, and can send some items directly from the In Box. Most items remain in the In Box until a user puts them into other applications. For example, a user can read incoming e-mail messages and then print them, send replies to them, or fax copies of them directly from the In Box before putting them into the Notepad application.  
Some incoming items may not remain in the In Box for a user to put away. An application can have the Newton system immediately transfer specific types of incoming items from the In Box to the application. For example, incoming stock quotes from a wireless modem could be transferred automatically to a stock-tracking application.
