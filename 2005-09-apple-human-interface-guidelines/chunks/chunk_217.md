Document and application windows always display active close and minimize buttons. (See ["Closing](#page-187-0) [Windows"](#page-187-0) (page 188) and ["Minimizing](#page-186-1) and Expanding Windows " (page 187) for details on what the close and minimize buttons do.) Include the zoom button if the window can be adjusted in size. Information on how the zoom button works is in "Resizing and Zooming [Windows](#page-186-0) " (page 187).  
<span id="page-171-0"></span>Utility windows always display an active close button but never an active minimize button.  
If buttons are not active, they should at least all be present in an inactive state. The exception is utility windows, where it is acceptable to display only one button, the close button.  
Alerts and modal dialogs do not include any of these buttons.  
The title bar should include a toolbar control if a toolbar is available in the window (see ["Toolbars"](#page-175-0) (page 176)).
