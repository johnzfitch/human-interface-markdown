<span id="page-133-3"></span>An **icon button** does not have a rectangular edge around it; the clickable area is the graphic itself (for example, the toolbar buttons in Finder windows). An icon button or a bevel button containing a pop-up menu has a single downward-pointing arrow, as shown in Figure 7-17. The button can behave like a standard pop-up menu, in which the image on the button is the current selection, or the button can represent the menu title and always display the same image.  
The menu and the button (or the bounding rectangle around the icon) are left-aligned, with no space between the top of the menu window and the bottom of the button. The arrow is 7 pixels wide at the top. The tip of the arrow is positioned 1 pixel below the icon's bottom edge. There should be 3 pixels from the tip of the arrow to the top of the menu window.
