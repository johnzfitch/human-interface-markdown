For design decisions regarding features in your application, you need to weigh the costs, which are not all financial, against the potential benefits. Every time you add a feature to your application, think about the following factors:  
- Your application gets larger.
- Your application gets slower.
- Your application's human interface gets more complex.
- You spend time in development rather than refinement of existing features.
- Your application becomes more difficult to document.
- You increase the number of possible user errors.
- Every new feature can have an impact on an existing feature.  
This section presents several additional factors you'll want to take into consideration when adding features to your product.
