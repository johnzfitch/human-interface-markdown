A changeable pane dialog, like the one shown in Figure 11-5, follows the same general guidelines as those outlined in ["A Simple Preferences Dialog"](#page-202-2) (page 203). However, it illustrates another implementation of many of the same basic guidelines you've seen so far, along with some new guidelines.

Center-equalization is again evident in Figure 11-6. The overall effect of the window is a balance between the visual weight of the controls on one side of the invisible center axis with the weight of the controls on the other side. The controls are also collectively balanced within the group box so that the distance from the farthest control on each side of the group box is the same for both the right and left sides (41 pixels in this example).  
Always center a tab view within a window.

Figure 11-7 illustrates a few guidelines about control placement:  
- The colons for stacked labels are right-aligned.
- Stacked controls are left-aligned when appropriate.
- Similar controls have consistent widths. For example, the Font pop-up menus and Size combo boxes are the same size in the two group boxes.

Figure 11-8 illustrates the following spacing guidelines:  
- Leave 12 pixels of space from the top of a tab to the bottom of the title bar.
- The text box around any label should be at least 2 pixels below the controls of any containing view.
- Within group boxes, leave at least a 16-pixel margin between controls and the edge of the group box. In this example, an 18-pixel border is used on one of the group boxes since it visually balances the window better than the minimum 16-pixel border.
- There should be a 20 pixel margin all the left side, right side, and bottom of a dialog.
