#### User Input  
There are two models for extending a continuous selection using Shift-click. In the **addition model,** new text is added to a current selection. In the **fixed-point model,** the user can extend the selection on either side of the insertion point. Figure 9-5 illustrates the results of three consecutive steps in both models.

When considering which model to use in your application, keep in mind that the addition model provides more flexibility by allowing users to extend a selection in *both* directions.
