A **placard** is a control that you can use as an information display or as background fill for a control area. Typically placards are used in document windows as a way to quickly modify the view of the contents, for example, to change the current page or the magnification.  
The most familiar use of the placard is as a small information panel, often placed at the bottom of a window to the left of the horizontal scroll bar. You can extend the functionality of a placard by, for example, having it provide a pop-up menu.
