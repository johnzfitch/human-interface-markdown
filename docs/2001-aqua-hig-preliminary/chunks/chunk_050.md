<span id="page-53-6"></span>Every document and utility window should have a title bar and a close button. Even if the window does not have an actual title (a tools palette, for example), the user should be able to move the window by dragging the title bar.  
A standard document window has  
- <span id="page-53-5"></span><span id="page-53-2"></span>■ a title bar
- <span id="page-53-4"></span>■ a resize control
- scroll bars (if not all the window's contents are visible)  
<span id="page-54-3"></span><span id="page-54-1"></span>■ close, minimize, and zoom buttons, although only the close button must be available at all times (except when the window has an open sheet)

<span id="page-54-2"></span>When a document has unsaved changes, the close button displays a dot.
