Colors look best against a background of neutral gray. Colors within your application will stand out more if the background and surrounding areas (such as the window frame and menus) are black and white or gray.  
#### Colored text  
Reading and legibility studies in the print (paper) world show that colored text is harder to read than black text on a white background. This also appears to be true in the limited studies that have been done in the computer domain, although almost all these studies have looked at colors on <sup>a</sup> black background, rather than <sup>a</sup> white background. (Keep this in mind ifyou hear that "amber is the best color for text.")  
#### Beware of blue  
The most illegible color is light blue, which should be avoided for text, thin lines, and small shapes. Adjacent colors that differ only in the amount of blue should also be avoided. However, for things that you want to make unobtrusive, such as grid lines, blue is the perfect color (think of graph paper or lined paper).  
#### Small objects  
People cannot easily discriminate between small areas of color—to be able to tell what color an object is, that object must be large enough to see without effort. Changes in the color of small objects must be obvious, not subtle.
