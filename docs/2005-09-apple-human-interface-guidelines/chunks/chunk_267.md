Buttons initiate an immediate action. If a button initiates an indeterminate process, the button should be dimmed until the process is complete and status feedback should be provided.  
If you need to offer two opposing functions, such as Reload and Stop in a browser, it's best to use two separate buttons instead of a single, dual-purpose button that changes state. This avoids the situation in which a user clicks a dual-purpose button when it is in one state, but the click is received and processed after the button has changed to the other state. If you must provide a single, dual-purpose button, be sure to keep track of when the button changes state so you can process the clicks appropriately. Also, be sure to provide immediate and informative feedback.
