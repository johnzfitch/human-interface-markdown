Mac OS X provides a consistent, well-integrated user interface for speech-recognition across all applications. This interface comprises the following items:  
■ **The Speech pane** of System Preferences is where users can control general speech-recognition settings, regardless of which application is using it. These settings include microphone volume (helpful for using non-Apple microphones) and the listening mode (push-to-talk versus continuous listening). Developers get these interface features for free regardless of how they use the speech-recognition engine.  
The Speech pane also contains controls specific to the Speakable Items application, such as whether Speakable Items is on or off and whether it applies to menus and window controls.
