Feedback and communication encompass far more than merely displaying alerts when something goes wrong. Instead, it involves keeping users informed about what's happening by providing appropriate feedback and enabling communication with your application.  
When a user initiates an action, always provide an indication that your application has received the user's input and is operating on it. Users want to know that a command is being carried out. If a command can't be carried out, they want to know why it can't and what can be done instead. When used sparingly, animation is one of the best ways to show a user that a requested action is being carried out.For example,when a user clicks an icon in the Dock, the icon bounces to let the userknow that the application is in the process of opening.  
Often, you can use animation to make clear the relationships between objects and the consequences of actions. Mac OS X uses animation to subtlybut clearlycommunicatewith the userin many different ways, a few of which are listed here:  
- When a user minimizes a window, it doesn't just disappear. Instead, it smoothly slips into the Dock, clearly telling the user where to find it again.
- To communicate the relationship between a sheet and a window, the sheet unfurls from the window's title bar.
- To emphasize the relationship between a drawer and a window, the drawer slides out from beneath the window, displaying shadowing that makes it look like a desk drawer.  
<span id="page-44-1"></span>You should consider using subtle animation effects such as these to enhance feedback in your user interface.  
For potentially lengthy operations, use a progress indicator to provide useful information about how long the operation will take. Users don't need to know precisely how many seconds an operation will take, but an estimate is helpful. For example, Mac OS X uses statements such as "about a minute remains" to indicate an approximate time frame. It can also be helpful to communicate the total number of steps needed to complete a task—for example, you might include text that says "Copying 30 of 850 files."  
**Note:** A good reason to provide feedback during lengthy operations is that if your application fails to respond to events for 2 seconds, the system automatically displays a busycursorforyour application. Userswho see this cursorwithout anyother feedback might thinkthatyour application is frozen and quit it using the Force Quit window.  
<span id="page-44-0"></span>Provide direct, simple feedback that people can understand. For example, error messages should spell out exactly what situation caused the error ("There's not enough space on that disk to save the document") and possible actions the user can take to rectify it ("Try saving the document in another location"). For more information on how to compose useful alert messages, see ["Writing](#page-241-2) Good Alert [Messages"](#page-241-2) (page 242).  
If your application consists of a foreground process that displays a user interface and a background process that performs some or all of the application's main tasks, take special care to conduct all communication with the user through the user interface of the foreground process. In particular, a background process should never displaya dialogorwindowinwhich the user is required to change settings or supply information. If a background process must communicate with the user, it should start or bring forward the foreground application. This is important because the user may not know (or remember) that a background process is running and receiving communication from it would be confusing.  
For example, consider a backup application consisting of a foreground process that displays a user interface and a background process that performs the scheduled backups. The user starts the application, sets the backup frequency and provides the data and backup locations, and quits the application, secure in the knowledge that backups will proceed as scheduled. If, at some time in the future, the backup diskbecomes full, the background process must tell the userimmediately; otherwise, the user may lose data. To do this, the background process should start the application and cause its Dock icon to bounce. Drawing the user's attention to a familiar application, instead of displaying an alert from an invisible process, prepares the user to receive the information and take appropriate action.  
<span id="page-45-2"></span>**Note:** A background-onlyapplication (also called a faceless background application) is not associated with a user-visible application. When communication with a user is essential, a background-only application can display an alert describing the situation, but the alert should direct the user to open some other application (such as System Preferences) to handle the problem. For some information on background-only applications, see *Runtime Configuration Guidelines* and the sample Carbon application *Folder Watching*.
