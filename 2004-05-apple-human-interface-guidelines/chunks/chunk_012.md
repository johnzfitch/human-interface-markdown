Double-clicking involves a second click that follows immediately after the first click. If the two clicks are close enough to each other in terms of time (as set by the user in Keyboard & Mouse preferences) and location (usually within a couple of pixels), they constitute a double click.  
Double-clicking is most commonly used as a shortcut for other actions, such as pressing Command-O to open a document or dragging to select a word. Because not everyone is physically able to perform a double click, it should *never* be the only way to perform an action.  
<span id="page-19-1"></span>Some applications support triple-clicking. For example, in a word processor, the first click sets the insertion point, the second click selects the whole word, and the third click selects the whole sentence or paragraph. Supporting more than three clicks is inadvisable.
