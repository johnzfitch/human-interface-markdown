The display of an iOS-based device is at the heart of the user's experience. Not only do people view beautiful text, graphics, and media on the display, they also physically interact with the Multi-Touch screen to drive their experience (even when they can't see the screen).  
Although displays of different dimensions and resolutions can have different effects on user experience with an app, some effects apply to all iOS-based devices:  
- The comfortable minimum size of tappable UI elements is 44 x 44 points.
- The quality of app artwork is very apparent.

iOS-based devices have the following screen sizes:  
**Table 1-1** Screen sizes of iOS-based devices  
| Device                              | Portrait          | Landscape         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| iPhone 4                            | 640 x 960 pixels  | 960 x 640 pixels  |
| iPad                                | 768 x 1024 pixels | 1024 x 768 pixels |
| Other iPhone and iPod touch devices | 320 x 480 pixels  | 480 x 320 pixels  |  
**Note: Pixel** is the appropriate unit of measurement to use when discussing the size of a device screen or the size of an icon you create in an image-editing application. **Point** is the appropriate unit of measurement to use when discussing the size of an area that is drawn onscreen.  
On a standard-resolution device screen, one point equals one pixel, but other resolutions might dictate a different relationship. On a Retina display, for example, one point equals two pixels.  
See "Points Versus Pixels" in *iOS Application Programming Guide* for a complete discussion of this concept.
