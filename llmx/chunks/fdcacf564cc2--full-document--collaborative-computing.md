Erickson, T.D. "Interfaces for Cooperative Work: An Eclectic Review of CSCW '88." *SIGCHI Bulletin* 21, no. 1 (July 1989). New York: ACM.

Although this nine-page paper summarizes results presented at a particular conference, it is a good summary of many of the most important interface issues that arise in trying to provide computer support for cooperative work.

Greif, Irene, ed. *Computer-Supported Cooperative Work: A Book of Readings.* San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann, 1988.

A collection of 28 papers on cooperative work. The papers include many of the classic papers from the history of the field as well as more recent work including theoretical discussions, project descriptions, empirical studies of how people use CSCW (computer-supported cognitive work) systems, and more.

Grudin, J. "Why CSCW Applications Fail: Problems in the Design and Evaluation of Organizational Interfaces." *CSCW Proceedings* (1988): 85–93.

Discusses three reasons why commercial CSCW applications often fail.
