<span id="page-288-3"></span><span id="page-288-2"></span>A **segmented control** is divided into two or more segments and behaves as a collection of radio buttons or checkboxes. Like a push button, a segmented control initiates an immediate action—that is, when the user clicks one of the segments, something should happen.  
Mac OS X offers different styles of segmented controls for use in differentwindowareas. The segmented control described in this section is suitable for use in the window body; it should not be used in the window-frame areas. For information on styles of segmented controls that are available for use in the window-frame areas (the toolbar and the bottom bar), see ["Window-Frame](#page-259-0) Controls" (page 260). Figure 15-26 shows an example of segmented controls in a window-body area.

#### Segmented Control Usage  
Use a segmented control when you want to offer the user a few closely related choices that affect a selected object. You can also use a segmented control to change views or panes in a window. Note that although a segmented control used as a view-changer looks similar to a tab view control, it does not behave the same: A segmented control is not attached to the panes, whereas a tab view control is attached to them. See "Tab [Views"](#page-341-0) (page 342) for more information about tab views.  
If you need to provide a way for users to add and delete objects in a source list or other split view, don't use a segmented control that contains the plus and minus symbols. Instead, if you need to put an add-delete control in a bottom bar, use a rectangular-style toolbar control (described in ["Controls](#page-259-1) for [Toolbars](#page-259-1) and Bottom Bars" (page 260)). If you need to put an add-delete control in the window body, use a gradient button (described in ["Gradient](#page-276-0) Buttons" (page 277)). Also, you don't need to create the plus and minus icons for these controls, because Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides these and many other icons for your use (see ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155) for more information).  
#### Segmented Control Contents and Labeling  
A segmented control can contain either icons or text, but not a mixture of both. However, when the control contains icons, you can place a text label below the control.  
For the text in each segment, or the label below it, use a noun (or short noun phrase) that describes a view or an object, and use title-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-135-0) of Interface Element Labels and [Text"](#page-135-0) (page 136) for more on this style).  
If you choose to use icons in a segmented control, be sure to consider using the images that are available in Mac OS X v10.5 and later(see ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155) for more information on these). If you need to design your own images, try to imitate the clarity and simple lines of the system-provided images. For some tips on how to create custom images of this type, see ["Designing](#page-153-2) Icons for [Rectangular-Style](#page-153-2) Toolbar Controls" (page 154).
