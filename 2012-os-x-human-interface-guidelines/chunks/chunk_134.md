A **popover** is a transient UI element that provides functionality that is directly related to a specific context, such as a control or an onscreen area. Popovers appear when users need them and (usually) disappear automatically when users finish interacting with them. For example, Calendar displays a popover in which users can create and edit a meeting.

A popover floats above the window that contains the control or area that it's related to, and its border includes an arrow (sometimes referred to as an anchor) that indicates the point from which it emerged. In some cases, users can detach a popover from itsrelated element, which causesthe popover to become a panel. For example, Calendar allows users to detach the meeting-editing popover so that they can make changes to it while they refer to other windows.

To learn how to define a popover in your code, see NSPopover. Follow the guidelines in this section to use popovers appropriately in your app.  
**Use a popover to display UI that users need occasionally.** Popovers are perfectly suited to provide small amounts of focused functionality that users need. For example, when usersselect a term and open a contextual menu, they can choose the Look Up "*term*" menu item to see the Dictionary definition (in addition to information related to the term) in a popover.

Because popovers can disappear when users finish interacting with them, users can spend more time focusing on their content and less time removing clutter from their workspace.  
**Consider using popovers instead of source lists, panels, or changeable panes.** You might want to use a popover instead of these UI elements because doing so allows you to present a more focused and stable UI. For example, users might not need to navigate or select objects in your window's source list very often. If you use a popover to display the source list's content, you can use the window space for more important UI that directly relates to the user's task.  
Using a popover to replace a panel that contains auxiliary information can also make sense, because you can ensure that the popover disappears when users click outside of it. For example, users appreciate that they don't have to explicitly dismiss the Safari Downloads popover before they continue interacting with the Safari browser window.  
Finally, using a popover to replace changeable panes in a main window can help your UI seem more stable. For example, if you offer secondary or transient functionality in a pane that users can hide and reveal, you can instead offer the functionality in a popover. Because a popover appears only when it's needed, it doesn't alter the look of the window. Users tend to be most comfortable with a window layout that does not change very often.  
**Allow users to detach a popover if appropriate.** Users might appreciate being able to convert a popover into a panel if they want to view other content or other windows while the popover content remains visible.  
**Don't use a popover as an alert.** Popovers and alerts are very different UI elements. For one thing, users choose to see a popover; they never choose to see an alert. If you use popovers and alerts interchangeably, you blur the distinctions between them and confuse users. In particular, if you use a popover to warn users about a serious problem or to help them avoid imminent, unintentional data loss, they are likely to dismiss the popover without reading it, and blame your app when negative results occur. If you really need to alert users(which should happen only rarely), use an alert; for guidelines on how to design an alert,see ["Alerts"](#page-235-0) (page 236).  
**As much as possible, ensure that the popover arrow points directly to the element that revealed it.** The arrow helps people remember where the popover came from and with what task or object it's associated.  
**In general, use the standard popover appearance.** The standard appearance is identified by the NSPopoverAppearanceMinimal constant. You can also use the "HUD" appearance, but this is generally only suited to an app that uses a dark UI and enables an immersive, media-centric experience.  
**Avoid including a "close popover" button.** In general, a popover should close automatically when the user doesn't need it anymore. This behavior helps users focus on their task without worrying about cluttering their desktop. For example, after users finish editing an Calendar event, they can click Done or they can click outside the event-editing popover to close it. Regardless of the method users choose, Calendar saves the edits they made.  
**Choose a closure behavior that makes sense in the context of the task the popover enables.** A popover can close in response to a user interaction (transient behavior), in response to a user's interaction with the view or element from which the popover emerged (semitransient behavior), or in an app-defined way. If a popover merely presents a set of choices, it can be appropriate to close it as soon as the user makes a choice (that is, using the transient behavior). Because this behavior mirrors the behavior of a menu, users are comfortable with it. If, on the other hand, you use a popover to enable a task that requires multiple user interactions, such as the Calendar event editing popover, you can use the semitransient behavior to close the popover when the user interacts with the area outside of it.  
**Avoid nesting popovers.** A popover that emergesfrom a control inside a different popover is physically difficult for users to interact with and confusing to see. In addition, users can't predict what will happen when they click outside of both popovers.  
**Avoid making a popover too big.** A popover should not appear to take over the entire screen. Instead, it should be just big enough to display its contents and still point to the area from which it emerged.  
**Avoid making significant appearance changes in a detachable popover.** If you allow users to detach a popover, you should ensure that the resulting panel looks similar to the original popover. If the new panel looks too different, users might forget where it came from.  
**If appropriate, change a popover's size while it remains visible.** You might want to change a popover's size if you use it to display both a minimal and an expanded view of the same information. For example, Calendar displays a minimal popover when users double-click a meeting they've created. If the user wants to edit the meeting, the minimal popover expandsto accommodate more information about the meeting and the editing controls. The transition from one popover size to another should be smoothly animated, so that users can be sure that they're still interacting with the same popover.
