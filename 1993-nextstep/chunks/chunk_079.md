Since more than one application can run at a time, the screen is likely to display windows for a variety of different applications. The Workspace Manager is one application that will often have a window on-screen. Some users will also run Mail and a spreadsheet, or perhaps a word processor and Digital Webster'" (a dictionary and thesaurus application), at the same time as other applications.  
The user must be able to pick a particular application, and a particular window in that application, to work in. The application that the user is currently working in is known as the *active application;* the windows that are the current focus of user attention in the active application are the *key window* and the *main window.* The key window and main window are usually one and the same. The two terms identify different functional roles that can be assumed by the same window:  
- The key window is the window that receives characters from the keyboard.
- The main window is the window containing the selected target for controls.  
These three concepts-the active application, key window, and main window-refer not to inherent properties of applications and windows, but to their status at a particular point in time. They're discussed more fully in the three sections that follow.
