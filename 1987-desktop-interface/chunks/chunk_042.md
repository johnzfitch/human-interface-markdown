Remember that color should never be the only thing that distinguishes objects. Other cues such as shape, location, pattern, or sound should always be used in addition to color, for the reasons discussed above.  
#### Backgrounds  
Generally, all interface elements (menus, window frames, and so on) should maintain a white background, using color to replace only pixels that are black in the black-andwhite interface. Maintaining the white background helps keep the clarity and the "look and feel" of the Desktop Interface.  
#### Outlines  
Outlines of menus, windows, and alert and dialog boxes should remain in black. Edges formed by color differences alone are hard for the eye to focus on, and these objects may appear against <sup>a</sup> colored desktop or window.
