#### Double-clicking  
Double-clicking involves a second click that follows immediately after the end of <sup>a</sup> first click. If the two clicks are close enough to one another in terms of time (as set by the user in the Control Panel) and of screen location, then they constitute a double click.  
The most common use of double-clicking is as <sup>a</sup> shortcut way to perform an action. For example, clicking twice on an icon is <sup>a</sup> faster way to open it than clicking once to select it, then choosing Open from the File menu; clicking twice on <sup>a</sup> word to select it is faster than dragging through it.Double-clicking can also be used to select a larger object than one that can be selected by a single click.  
Double-clicking is a shortcut for those users physically able to use it. Double-clicking must never be the only way to perform <sup>a</sup> given action. Many novice users, children, and disabled people have a hard time double-clicking.  
Some applications support selection by double-clicking and triple-clicking. As always with multiple clicks, the second click extends the effect of the first click, and the third click extends the effect of the second click. For example, in a text-oriented application, the first click sets an insertion point, the second click selects the whole word containing the insertion point, and the third click might select the whole sentence or paragraph. In a graphics application, the first click might select a single object, and double and triple clicks might select successively larger sets of objects.  
Three clicks is probably the practical limit, and even that is difficult for many people. If an application defines the effect only of single-and double-clicking, a third click should have no effect. If triple-clicking is defined, then the fourth click should have no effect.
