If you followed standard website design and implementation best practices when you developed your web content, it's likely that your content is at least compatible with Safari on iPhone. Now, you need to decide if you want to optimize your webpages for Safari on iPhone or use your content to create an iPhone web application. To help you make this decision, this section elaborates on the main attributes of an iPhone web application, as defined in "Types of iPhone [Content"](#page-14-1) (page 15).  
<span id="page-15-1"></span>Most importantly, an iPhone web application provides a focused solution to a well-defined problem: Users prefer an application that performs one task perfectly to an application that tries to perform many tasks but excels at none of them. Thisis especially true for iPhone web applications, because users expect to accomplish things quickly on iPhone and they don't want to waste time either figuring out what an application does or wading through unnecessary functionality. For example, the built-in Weather application (shown in Figure 2-2) displays a focused, easy-to-understand answer to the question "What's the weather forecast for my chosen location?".

**Figure 2-2** The built-in Weather application focuses on a single task  
If you can easily identify the primary task your webpage performs, you should consider developing an iPhone web application that offers that functionality to users. For example, if the primary purpose of your webpage is to aggregate information on a single topic, you could design an iPhone web application that presents that information in a way that looks at home on iPhone.  
If, however, your website includes a combination of different functions and types of information, you have two options: You can optimize it for iPhone or you can create an iPhone web application using only one feature of your content. For example, a website that displays an up-to-date list of bestselling novels, provides news about authors and book reviews, hosts book discussions, and allows usersto order books has a unifying theme but no single purpose. However, an iPhone web application that allows users to order a book from a list of current bestsellers would be a focused and useful application. Another possibility using this example is an iPhone web application that allows users to keep track of a personal reading list, adding new books and checking off others when they're finished.  
If you've decided to design an iPhone web application, it's worth revisiting the main attributes of iPhone web applications. Specifically, an iPhone web application emulates the look and feel of built-in iPhone applications in three ways:  
- An iPhone web application minimizes the user's awareness of the browser experience.
- Although an iPhone web application is, by definition, a web application that users open in Safari on iPhone, itsuppressesthe browser's presence in its user interface. As a result, users perceive the application as a standalone solution. One way to achieve this effect is to set viewport properties so that the iPhone web application displays correctly in Safari on iPhone and requires no zooming or panning. Another way isto provide custom navigation controls embedded in the webpage so users don't have to use the Safari on iPhone navigation controls.
- An iPhone web application reproduces the control style, layout, and behavior of the built-in iPhone applications.
- Users are accustomed to the user experience offered by built-in iPhone applications, which means that they recognize the function ofspecific controls and expect a clean, easy-to-use layout. Additionally, users expect scrolling to be minimized and constrained to the vertical direction, color usage to be subtle, and branding to be discreet.
- An iPhone web application integrates with built-in iPhone features and services.
- Users expect to be able to access built-in iPhone functionality, such as the phone and Google maps, while they are using an iPhone web application.
