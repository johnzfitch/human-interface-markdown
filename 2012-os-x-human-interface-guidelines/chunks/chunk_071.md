With Reminders, users keep track of tasks, to-dos, and events. Usersspecify the time and location of a reminder and mark it completed when it's finished. They can set alarms for their reminders that go off at a certain time or location. You can integrate information from Reminders directly into your app. Using the Event Kit framework, you can access users' reminders, and create, edit, or delete new reminders. Reminders and Calendars use the same framework and access the same Calendar database. See *Calendar and Reminders Programming Guide* for more information.

Additionally, when you perform operations on a group of reminders that result in significant changes to the user's data, make sure the user is fully informed of the action your app is about to perform.
