<span id="page-292-2"></span>An **Action menu** is a specific type of pop-up menu that's designed to replace an application-wide contextual menu. For example, in its default set of toolbar controls, the Finder includes an Action menu that performs tasks related to the currently selected item, as shown in Figure 15-33.

**Important:** An Action menu is one of the three window-body controlsthat can also be used in a window-frame area. To learn more about controls that are designed specifically for use in window-frame areas, see ["Window-Frame](#page-254-1) Controls" (page 255).  
#### Action Menu Usage  
Use an Action pop-up menu when you want to provide a visible shortcut to a handful of useful commands. Although contextual menus also provide shortcuts to a small number of commands, the fact that they are hidden makes them difficult for new users to discover and for all users to remember. (You can learn more about contextual menusin ["Contextual](#page-187-1) Menus" (page 188).) If you are thinking of providing (or already provide) an application-wide contextual menu, you might choose to replace it with an Action menu control in the toolbar.  
<span id="page-293-0"></span>You can also use an Action menu at the bottom of a list view or source list to provide commands that apply to items in the list. For example, Mail provides an Action menu at the bottom of its source list (shown in Figure 15-34). This Action menu contains commands that act on the account or mailbox selected in the source list.

Avoid placing an Action menu control anywhere else in the body of a window. Contextual menus appear when the user selects an object in a window and Control-clicks (or clicks the right button of a properly configured two-button mouse). Because such an object might appear anywhere in a window, there's no reasonable, consistent location for an Action menu control that contains the commands specific to that object.  
#### Action Menu Contents and Labeling  
An Action menu should display only the Action icon and the standard downward-pointing arrow used in icon and bevel buttons with attached pop-up menus (for more information about these controls, see ["Icon](#page-287-0) Buttons and Bevel [Buttons](#page-287-0) with Pop-Up Menus" (page 288)). It's essential that you use the system-supplied Action icon so users understand what the control does (for more information on the Action icon and icons available for other types of controls, see ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155)).  
The contents of an Action menu should conform to the guidelines for contextual menus, such as ensuring that each Action menu item is also available as a menu command and avoiding the display of keyboard shortcuts. For more information on the guidelinesthat govern contextual menus,see ["Contextual](#page-187-1) Menus" (page 188).  
An Action menu does not need a label, because users are familiar with the meaning of the Action icon. The only exception is the label you should supply for an Action menu button in a toolbar, because users can customize the toolbar to view toolbar items asicons with text or astext instead of icons(see ["Toolbars"](#page-199-0) (page 200) for more information on toolbars).  
#### Action Menu Specifications  
**Control sizes**: The Action menu icon is available in regular and smallsizes. Use the icon size that's proportional to the size of the control you want to use.  
**Control spacing**: Spacing depends on what type of control you use. For details,see ["Rectangular-Style](#page-256-0) Toolbar [Controls"](#page-256-0) (page 257) (if you plan to put an Action menu in a toolbar) or ["Gradient](#page-272-0) Buttons" (page 273) (if you plan to put an Action menu below a source list or other type of list view).  
#### Action Menu Implementation  
You can create an Action menu in Interface Builder. If you need an Action menu control for a toolbar, select a rectangular-style toolbar control (see ["Rectangular-Style](#page-256-0) Toolbar Controls" (page 257) for more information about this control). In the Attributes pane of the inspector, specify NSActionTemplate for the image.
