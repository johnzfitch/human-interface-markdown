#### Immediate Feedback

Since users are constantly in charge of their own actions, they require very direct and immediate feedback on particular actions. They need to know that a particular action is being performed or has been completed. For example, the user knows a particular document is opened when its window fills the screen. When an item is highlighted, the user knows that she has selected it. When a menu name is selected, the menu itself becomes visible. When the pointer is temporarily deactivated while a process is being completed, it turns into a watch to indicate that it will be some time before it is active again. When the user selects a paintbrush as a tool for drawing, the pointer changes into the shape of the paintbrush.
