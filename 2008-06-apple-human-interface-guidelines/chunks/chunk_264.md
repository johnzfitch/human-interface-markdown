Each application and document window exists in its own layer, so documents from different applications can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the window was last accessed. When a user clicks an inactive document or chooses it from the Window menu, only that document, and any open panels, should be brought to the front. Users can bring all windows of an application forward by clicking itsicon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the application's Window menu. These actions should bring forward all of the application's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order within the application. For more information, see "The [Window](#page-181-0) Menu" (page 182).  
<span id="page-216-5"></span><span id="page-216-3"></span>Panels are always in the same layer, the top layer. They are visible only when their application is active and they float on top of any document windows in the application.  
<span id="page-216-2"></span><span id="page-216-1"></span>Users can cycle forward or backward through all open document windows by using Command-Grave Accent (Command-`) and Command-Shift-Grave Accent (Command-Shift-`). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.
