As illustrated below, a scroller has just three parts, a *bar,* a *knob,* and an optional set of *scroll buttons.* This figure shows a vertical scroller, which scrolls information up and down. A horizontal scroller scrolls from side to side.  
![](images/_page_160_Picture_2.jpeg)  
If the material to be displayed is provided with scrollers, but happens, perhaps temporarily, to fit within the opening, then the knob and scroll buttons disappear, so the scroller looks like a plain gray strip. The strip indicates that the material will be scrollable, should it grow larger than the opening.
