When a usertypes a password into a text field, each typed character should appear as a bullet, matching the number of characters typed by the user. If the user deletes a character with the Delete key, one bullet is deleted from the text field and the insertion point moves back one bullet, as if the bullet represented an actual character. Double-clickingbulleted text in a password field selects all the bullets in the text field.  
When the user leaves the text field (by pressing Tab, for example), the number of bullets in the text field should be modified so that the field does not reflect the actual number of characters in the password.
