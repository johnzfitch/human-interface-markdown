SIGCHI (Special Interest Group in Computer Human Interaction) is a special interest group of the ACM concerned with computer and human interaction. SIGCHI encompasses all aspects of the human-computer interaction process, including research and development efforts leading to the design and evaluation of user interfaces. This group focuses on how people communicate and interact with computer systems.  
There are some local SIGCHI groups that meet monthly and present programs on human-computer interaction. Contact the ACM for more information.  
The *SIGCHI Bulletin* is a journal published by SIGCHI. It contains articles, news about the group's activities, and a calendar of events.  
The Computer Human Interaction Conference (called CHI) is a yearly conference on human-computer interaction. The conference has papers, panels, posters, lab reviews, and small group meetings on topics of interest.  
This conference is held in the spring. The conference proceedings are published as a special edition of the *SIGCHI Bulletin*.  
The Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology is a joint conference of SIGCHI and SIGGRAPH, the special interest group devoted to computer graphics and animation. It is usually held in the fall.
