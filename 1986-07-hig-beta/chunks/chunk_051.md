If the left or right end of a text selection is a word, follow these rules at that end, regardless of whether there's a word at the other end.  
This feature should be used only if the application supports the full defmition of a word (as detailed in "Selecting Words"), rather than the defmition of a word as "anything between two spaces." These rules apply to any selection that's one or more whole words, whether it was chosen with a double click or as a range selection.  
#### Example 1:  
| 1. | Select a word,             | to<br>with<br>Drink<br>me<br>_<br>thine<br>eyes.     |

| 3, | Select an insertion point. | to<br>th<br>Dri<br>nk<br>me<br>wi<br>eyes.<br>~hi ne |
