Although a single click selects only an insertion point in text, multiple-clicking selects characters already inserted. A multiple-click always selects a linguistically meaningful unit. Normally, double-clicking selects a word, and triple-clicking selects a paragraph (all the text between return characters).  
If the user drags from a multiple-click, additional units of the same type are selected. For example, double-clicking a word selects the word; dragging from the double-click then selects every other word that's even partially within the range defined by the anchor and end points.  
#### **Extending the Selection**  
Normally, as soon as users commit themselves to a new selection by pressing a mouse button (to begin clicking or dragging), the current selection is canceled in favor of the new one. However, when the Alternate or Shift key is held down, the current selection is extended, not canceled.  
#### **Continuous Extension**  
Clicking and dragging with the Alternate key down results in a new selection that's a continuation of the previous one. The new selection includes the previous selection and everything lying between it and the location of the cursor when the user releases the mouse button. The Alternate key is thus an alternative to dragging as a way of selecting a rangethe user can click to establish an anchor point, hold down the Alternate key, and click again to determine the end point.  
If the previous selection is already a range, Alternate-clicking and Alternate-dragging move the edge of selection that's closest to the cursor when the mouse button goes down to the cursor's location when the mouse button goes up. The Alternate key thus also provides a way of adjusting the boundaries of the previous selection. Alternate-clicking outside a selected range extends the range to the point of the click. Alternate-clicking inside a selected range repositions the closest edge of the selection to the point of the click.

If the current selection is the result of a multiple-click, the Alternate key extends it just as dragging would. Double-clicking a word, holding the Alternate key down, and clicking another word elsewhere in the text extends the selection to include both words and all those between.  
#### **Discontinuous Extension**  
The Shift key lets users add to, or subtract from, the current selection. Additions don't have to be continuations of the current selection, so discontinuous selections can result.  
**Note:** Discontinuous selection is common for editable graphics, icons, and items arranged in a list. It usually isn't implemented for normal text.  
To add to the selection, the user clicks and drags as usual while holding the Shift key down. New material is selected, but the previous selection also remains. This is illustrated in the middle column of the following figure.

To subtract from the selection, the user holds the Shift key down while clicking or dragging over the current selection. Shift-clicking and Shift-dragging deselect material that's already been selected. While keeping the Shift key down, the user can first select material, then deselect it, then select it again.  
Shift-dragging either selects or deselects; it never does both. Which it does depends on the item under the cursor when the mouse button goes down:  
- If the item isn't currently part of the selection, Shift-dragging serves to select it and everything the user drags over. It won't deselect material that happens already to be selected.
- If the item is currently selected, Shift-dragging deselects it and any other selected material that's dragged over. It won't add unselected material to the selection.
