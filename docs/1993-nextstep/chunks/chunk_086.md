<!-- Chunk 86 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 830 -->
One of the principles of the NeXTSTEP user interface is that users are in control of their own workspace. Part of this control is the freedom to rearrange windows to suit the users' own tastes and needs. However, if a window that's been dismissed and then brought up again doesn't appear in its previous location, the user's work of rearranging windows is thrown away. The user might have to move the window back to its previous location every time the window is brought up.  
To avoid making the user rearrange windows unnecessarily, each panel and non-document standard window should remember its own location. The next time the window is brought up, it should appear in the location it last appeared in. For example, suppose the user brings up a Find panel, moves it to a new position, and then closes it. The next time the user brings up the Find panel, it should come up in the new position-even if the user has quit and restarted the application in the meantime.  
Whether document windows should also remember their position depends on the application. For example, Digital Librarian document windows don't remember their positions because users typically open many documents at once, and thus need the application's help in positioning the windows. However, an application such as a drawing program that's typically used for editing one file at a time should probably let the user determine each document window's default location.  
The first time a window comes up, its position is determined by the application. To ensure a consistent user interface, all applications should follow these guidelines for initial locations of windows:  
- When an application starts up, its main menu should appear in the upper left corner of the screen, unless the user has specified a different location for it.
- Standard windows should come up to the right of the main menu, allowing enough room for submenus that might later be attached to the main menu. Some applications also allow room for panels to come up to the left of the standard window and below the main menu.
- Attention panels should come up centered in the upper part of the screen, where they won't be overlooked.
- No part of any window (other than miniwindows and icons) should be placed off-screen, unless the user has put it there.  
#### **Programming Note: Saving Window Positions**  
Three methods exist to help panels and non-document standard windows remember their window position. Calling the **setFrameAutosaveName:** method once per window makes the window save its position in the defaults system whenever necessary. The next time the window comes up, it automatically appears at the last-saved position. A less automated way of remembering the window position is to call **saveFrameUsingName:**  every time you wish to save the position, and call **setFrameUsingName:** to set the window's position when it's being brought up.  
The methods discussed above aren't appropriate for document windows, since there's no easy way to guarantee unique names for documents. If your application saves the positions of its document windows, you should use the **saveFrameToString:** method to save a representation of the window's position into the document itself. When opening the document, you should position its window using **setFrameFromString:.**
