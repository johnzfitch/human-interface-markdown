Except when an application is useless without a particular standard window, each standard window should have a miniaturize button. When a window is miniaturized, it should remain miniaturized until the user explicitly unminiaturizes it.  
Because a miniaturized window isn't likely to be foremost in the user's thoughts, the application should never alter a miniaturized window without the user's knowledge. However, it's fine for an application to continue doing some work in a miniaturized window, as long as the user requested that the work be done. For example, the Terminal application completes commands that the user entered in a Terminal window. But it's unacceptable, for example, to change the font in a miniaturized window unless the user specified a font change for *all* windows.  
The miniaturize button has a counterpart command in the Windows menu that miniaturizes the key window. You can also provide a command in the Document menu that miniaturizes several related windows into a single mini window. See "The Windows Menu" and "The Document Menu" in Chapter 6 for information on how these commands work.
