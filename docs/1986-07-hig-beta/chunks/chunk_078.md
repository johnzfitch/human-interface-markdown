Give text room to grow during localization. For example, don't create a screen-sized dialog box that is completely fJlled with text. Some languages require more characters than English does, to convey equivalent messages.  
When creating parameterized text, be sure the localizer will be able to rearrange the sentence as needed. For example, if an alert box sentence is to say "There was a problem doing AD to the 1\1." then the localizer will be able to correctly order the noun and prepositional phrase for different languages.  
Avoid hard-coding positions for drawing text or graphics. If possible, use a UserItem for positioning or dynamic display or PIer to display static graphics.
