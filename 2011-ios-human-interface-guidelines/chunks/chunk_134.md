Use an action sheet to:  
- Provide alternate ways a task can be completed. An action sheet allows you to provide a range of choices that make sense in the context of the current task, without giving these choices a permanent place in the user interface.
- Get confirmation before completing a potentially dangeroustask. An action sheet prompts usersto think about the potentially dangerous effects of the step they're about to take and givesthem some alternatives. This type of communication is particularly important on iOS-based devices because sometimes users tap controls without meaning to.  
**On iPhone, coordinate the action sheet background appearance with the navigation bars and toolbars**. Use the translucent black background if your application uses black navigation bars and toolbars. Use the default blue background if your navigation bars and toolbars are the default blue color.  
All action sheets in your iPhone application should have the same background color.  
**On iPhone, include a Cancel button** so that users can easily and safely abandon the task. Place the Cancel button at the bottom of the action sheet to encourage users to read through all the alternatives before making a choice. By default, the appearance of the Cancel button coordinates with the background of the action sheet.  
#### **On iPad, choose whether to display an action sheet with animation or without animation**.  
- Display an action sheet without animation to provide alternatives related to a task that the user initiates from outside a popover. Without animation, an action sheet and its popover appear simultaneously. When you display an action sheet this way, the popover's arrow points to the control or area the user tapped to initiate the task.
- Do not include a Cancel button when the action sheet is displayed without animation, because people can tap outside the popover to dismiss the action sheet without selecting one of the other alternatives.
- Display an action sheet with animation to provide alternatives related to a task that the user initiates from within an open popover. With animation, an action sheetslides up over an open popover's content.  
An animated action sheet should include a Cancel button, because people need to be able to dismiss the action sheet without closing the popover.  
**On both devices, use the red button color if you need to provide a button that performs a potentially destructive action**. Display a red button at the top of the action sheet, because the closer to the top of the action sheet a button is, the more eye-catching it is. And, on iPhone, the farther a destructive button is from the bottom of an action sheet, the less likely users are to tap it when they're aiming for the Home button.

<span id="page-120-0"></span>**Avoid making users scroll through an action sheet**. If you include too many buttons in an action sheet, users must scroll to see all actions. This is a disconcerting experience for users, because they must spend extra time considering each choice. Also, it can be very difficult for users to scroll without inadvertently tapping a button.
