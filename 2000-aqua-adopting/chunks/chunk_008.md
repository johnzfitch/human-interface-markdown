A drawer should be used only as a window pane containing supporting material that is used fairly frequently, but that does not need to be visible all the time. Contrast this with a palette, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer. Some examples of uses of drawers include access to favorites lists, access to the mailboxes drawer in the Mail application, or access to favorites or bookmarks in a browser.  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are primarily intended to replace modal dialogs, as described in ["When to Use Sheets" \(page 6\).](#page-5-1)
