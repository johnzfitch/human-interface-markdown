In addition to the way menu items are name and grouped, menus have other features that provide added information:  
- An ellipsis (...) after a menu item means that after the item is chosen, the user will be asked for more information before the operation is carried out. Usually, the user must fill in a dialog box and click an OK button or its equivalent. Don't use the ellipsis when the dialog that will appear is merely a confirmation or warning (for example, "Save changes before quitting?").
- Check marks indicate attributes that are currently in effect.  
- The application greys out any items that the user can't choose at that moment. If the user moves the pointer over a dimmed item, that item isn't highlighted.
- If an item has a keyboard equivalent (if it can be chosen from the keyboard as well as from a menu), its name in the menu is followed by the Apple (or cloverleaf) symbol and a character. To choose an item this way, the user presses the character key while holding down the Apple (Command) key.  
Figure 27 illustrates these features.

Several other menu features are also supported:  
Select All

- A menu item can be shown in Bold, Italic, Outline, Underline, or Shadow character style. This should be done only in the Style menu, to illustrate the text styles.
- A menu item can be preceded by a special character such as √ or
(to indicate which item is in effect). Icons can also appear in menus, but because of their size they require two menu lines.
- Applications can have special kinds of menus for special situations. A pull-down menu can even be a palette that can be "tom off" the menu bar and moved around the screen. See "Palettes," elsewhere in this chapter.
