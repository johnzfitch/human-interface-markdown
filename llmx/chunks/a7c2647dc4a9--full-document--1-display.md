## 1. DISPLAY

The display is a black-and-white bit-mapped CRT having 360 scan lines of 720 dots each, with the screen's surface perpendicular to the surface on which the computer sits. Normal presentation of graphics or text consists of black lines or characters on a white background. The screen image has a 3:4 aspect ratio (long axis horizontal) and is physically located above a movable keyboard.
