Control panels should be "assistance savvy," which means that they should  
- display the Help button (that is, the button with the question mark icon) for context-sensitive help
- provide suitable entries in the Apple Guide databases for "Guide Me" and "Do It For Me" assistance  
Most control panels will be included in the general Apple Guide database, but a complex control panel may require its own database.  
Control panels should also provide help balloons. See the "Language" chapter of *Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines* for general guidelines on Balloon Help behavior and content.
