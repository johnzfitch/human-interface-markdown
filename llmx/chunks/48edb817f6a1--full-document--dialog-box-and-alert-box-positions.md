#### Dialog Box and Alert Box Positions

Open dialog boxes and alert boxes on the screen where the user is working. On a computer system with one monitor, display the dialog box or alert box horizontally centered on the screen. The dialog or alert window should appear with one-fifth of the vertical desktop area (not including the menu bar) above it and the rest below the window. Figure 5-19 shows where to place an alert or dialog box on a single screen if no windows that the alert or dialog box is related to are open.

If you are displaying a dialog box or alert box that relates to a specific document, position it relative to the document window. This position reinforces the relationship of the two windows and also puts the box near the user's focus. Leave one-fifth of the document visible above the dialog box or alert box. Figure 5-20 shows where to position an alert or dialog box in relation to the active document window.

Window Behaviors **151**

When the user has more than one monitor connected to the computer, display the dialog box or alert box on the screen where the user's attention is. For example, if a text document is active, open a find-and-replace dialog box on the screen where the text document appears, not necessarily on the screen where the menu bar is. Leave one-fifth of the document visible above the dialog box or alert box. Figure 5-21 shows where to place an alert or dialog box when the user has more than one monitor connected to the computer.
