Don't use sheets in the following situations:  
- For dialogs that apply to several windows. Use sheets only when a particular dialog is associated with only one window.
- <span id="page-134-1"></span>■ For modeless operations in which the dialog should be left open to allow the user to observe the effects of changes applied. Such tasks (find and replace operations, for example) are better suited to modeless dialogs, utility windows, or drawers.
- On a window that doesn't have a title bar. Sheets should emerge from a definite visual edge.
- When the user will need information in the window that is essential to filling in requested information in the sheet.
