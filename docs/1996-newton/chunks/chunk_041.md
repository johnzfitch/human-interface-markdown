There are several standard controls for manipulating container views. These controls include the drag handle, folder tab, Close box, local scroll arrows, universal scroll arrows, and Overview button. The first four controls are part of the container view they affect. The latter two controls are not part of the container view they affect. [Figure 2-2](#page-47-0) points out the standard view controls.
