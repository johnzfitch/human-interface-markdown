| Font        | Brings up the Font menu, which has commands to alter the font of<br>the current selection. (See "The Font Menu," later in this chapter.)       |
| Text        | Attaches the Text menu, which lets the user choose the format of the<br>selected blocks of text. (See "The Text Menu," later in this chapter.) |
| Page Layout | Brings up the Page Layout panel, which lets users determine how<br>documents are to be printed and displayed on the screen.                    |  
The Format menu should hold the principal formatting commands needed by users of the application. For applications that deal mainly in numbers, they may be commands that format the text display of floating-point numbers or the graphical display of numeric data. For text processors, they may include the commands that would otherwise go into the Text menu, plus others.  
If an application promotes the Font command to the main menu and has no other commands to add to the Format menu, the Format menu would become little more than a container for the Text menu. In this circumstance, the commands that would otherwise go in the Text menu should be placed directly in the Format menu. A separate Text menu is needed only when there's reason to isolate these commands from other formatting commands or to shorten what would otherwise be an excessively long "Format menu.  
When commands from the Text menu are placed in the Format menu, they should follow the Page Layout command, so that the Copy Ruler and Paste Ruler commands end the menu.
