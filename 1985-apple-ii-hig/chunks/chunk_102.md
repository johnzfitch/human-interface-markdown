The Edit menu contains the commands that delete, move, and copy objects, as well as commands such as Undo, Show Clipboard, and Select All. This section also discusses the Clipboard, which is controlled by the Edit menu commands. Text editing methods that don't use menu commands are discussed under "Text Editing".  
The standard order of commands in the Edit menu is shown in Figure 19.
