## Design for the Macintosh

When your application uses standard elements or you design custom elements, these elements need to fit into the Macintosh interface framework. This means you should follow the Macintosh design guidelines and not imitate other vendors' designs. The Macintosh has a light source at the upper-left corner of the screen and a two-dimensional appearance. Your designs must be compatible with black-and-white designs, since that is the basis for the Macintosh interface and many users have only black-and-white displays.
