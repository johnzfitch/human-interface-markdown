Dashboard provides a way for users to get information and perform simple tasks quickly and easily. Appearing and disappearing with a single keystroke or mouse gesture, Dashboard presents a default or user-defined set of widgets in a format reminiscent of a heads-up display. Each widget is small, visually appealing, and clearly indicative of its purpose. For example, each of the Mac OS X Dashboard widgets shown in [Figure 5-3](#page-64-1) (page 65) is an attractive, scaled-down interface to a common task.

You can develop a standalone widget that performs a lightweight, well-defined task or a widget whose task is actually performed by your larger, more functional application. This section summarizes both the high-level and user-interface guidelines you should follow as you design your widget. Step-by-step instructions for how to implement a Dashboard widget, including plentiful code and user interface examples, are available in *Dashboard Tutorial*.  
<span id="page-64-2"></span><span id="page-64-0"></span>Many of the user-interface design principles covered in ["Human Interface Design"](#page-38-0) (page 39) are also applicable to Dashboard widgets. Following these guidelines gives users an automatic familiarity with this technology.
