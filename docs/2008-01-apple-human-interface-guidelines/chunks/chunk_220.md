<span id="page-223-4"></span>When the user clicks the **minimize button**, double-clicks the title bar, or presses Command-M, the window minimizes into the Dock. The window's icon remains in the Dock until the user clicks it or, if it is the application's only open window, until the user clicks the application icon in the Dock. For more information about the Dock, see "The [Dock"](#page-63-0) (page 64).  
<span id="page-223-3"></span>Clicking an application icon in the Dock should always result in a window—a document or another appropriate window—becoming active. If a document-based application is not open when the user clicks the Dock icon, the application should open a new, untitled window.  
<span id="page-223-6"></span>While an application is open, the Dock icon has a symbol below it. When a user clicks an open application's icon in the Dock, the application becomes active and all open unminimized windows are brought to the front; minimized document windows remain in the Dock. If there are no unminimized windows when the user clicks the Dock icon, the last minimized window should be expanded and made active. If no documents are open, the application should open a new window. (If your application is not document-based, display the application's main window.)
