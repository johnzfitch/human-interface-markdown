If the default color table colors aren't available, the system software gracefully degrades to black and white. First the operating system tries to match 8-bit colors. If it can't successfully match the colors you specify with those in the system palette, then it displays the 4-bit icon that you supply. If the operating system can't find or match the 4-bit colors, then it displays the icon in black and white. The system software won't substitute colors that aren't visually close to colors that you assigned. If you choose colors other than the 34 marked in Figure 8-23, use them for detail and not for essential parts of your windows or icons.  
#### Selection Mechanism for Color Icons 8  
When a color icon is selected, the color decreases in brightness. This means that the colors appear darker when selected. On a color monitor, a black-and-white icon turns gray when selected. On a black-and-white monitor, a black-and-white icon uses reverse video to show selection. To make selected items appear distinct from unselected ones, use light colors for large areas. Note that only the 34 colors shown in Figure 8-23 get darkened when a color icon is selected. This means that if you use colors other than those 34 colors in large amounts in an icon, that icon will not get darkened and therefore will not look selected.
