The valid **destination region** of a document window is usually the window's content area minus the title bar and areas used for controls (such as scroll bars, resize controls, tool palettes, rulers, and placards). When there are multiple destination regions within a window, only one destination region is highlighted at a time.  
When the user drags an acceptable item from one destination region to another, your application highlights the destination region as soon as the pointer enters it and removes the highlighting when the pointer leaves the region.  
If a drag-and-drop operation takes place entirely within one destination region (moving a document icon to a different location in the same folder window, for example), don't highlight the destination region, to avoid distracting the user. However, if the user drags an item completely out of a destination region and then drags the same item back to the same destination region, the destination region should be highlighted.  
You can provide more specific destination feedback within a larger destination region. For example, when the user drags text from one document window to another, the inactive window should display an insertion point where the dragged text would go if the user releases the mouse button.  
In many situations, highlighting a more narrowly defined area of a window is more appropriate than highlighting the entire content region; examples are spreadsheets, text boxes, fill-in forms, and panes. In these cases, the destination region must be tailored to more precisely indicate the specific destination.
