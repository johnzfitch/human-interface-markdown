If a user attempts to drop an item on a destination that does not accept it, the item zooms from its mouse-up location back to its source location (a "zoomback"). The zoomback behavior should also occur when a drop inside a valid destination does not result in a successful operation (if, for example, there is insufficient memory). The Drag Manager provides this feedback when it determines that no receiver requested the sender's information.  
If the user attempts to drag multiple items to a destination that does not accept all of the items, none of the items should be accepted. In such cases you could display a dialog informing the user of the type of data the destination accepts and which items in the dragged set are "unacceptable."
