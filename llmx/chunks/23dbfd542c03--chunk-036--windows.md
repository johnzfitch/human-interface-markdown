#### Windows  
The way the user accesses the document is through a window. A window is a view into the document—if the document is larger than the window, the window is a view of a portion of the document. The application puts one or more windows on the screen, each window showing a view of a document or of auxiliary information used in processing the document.  
Generally, it is unwise to allow multiple windows for the same document. It confuses the relationship of windows to icons ("which window do I close to close the document?"). If multiple views are desirable, the window can be split.  
There are several kinds of windows. Standard document windows are the most obvious kind, but dialog and alert boxes are technically windows too. Most of this section deals with document windows; dialogs and alerts are discussed together at the end of this section. Because controls appear only in windows, they are also discussed in this section.  
This section is about a window's structural components, or window frame. For a standard document window, these include the title bar, size box, close box, zoom box, and scroll bars. The application determines the *content* of the window.
