A **text input field** accepts user-entered text.

**API Note:** To define a text input field in your code, use the NSTextField class.  
A text input field (also called an editable text field) is a rectangular area in which the user enterstext or modifies existing text. A text input field displays user-supplied text in a system font that is appropriate for the size of the control. In addition, a text input field can contain a token field control, which displays the user input in the form of a draggable token. For more information on tokens, see [Token](#page-213-0) Field (page 214).  
By default, a text input field supports keyboard focus and password entry.  
Use a text input field to get information from the user.  
**Be sure to perform appropriate edit checks when you receive user input.** For example, if the only legitimate value for a field is a string of digits, an app should issue an alert if the user types characters other than digits. In most cases, the appropriate time to check the data in the field is when the user clicks outside the field or presses the Return, Enter, or Tab key.  
**Be sure to use a combo box if you want to combine a menu or list of choices with a text input field.** Don't try to create one by putting a text input field and a menu together. For more information about combo boxes, see [Combination](#page-196-0) Box (page 197).  
**In general, display an introductory label with a text input field.** A label helps users understand what type of information they should enter. Generally, these labels should have title-style capitalization (described in [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) Labels and Text (page 47)).  
**In general, ensure that the length of a text input field comfortably accommodates the length of the expected input.** The length of a text input field helps users gauge whether they're inputting the appropriate information.  
**Space multiple text input fields evenly.** If you want to use more than one text input field in a window, you need to leave enough space between them so users can easily see which input field belongs with each introductory label. If you need to position more than one text input field at the same height (that is, in a horizontal line), be sure to leave plenty of space between the end of one text field and the introductory label of the next. Typically, however, multiple text input fields are stacked vertically, as in a form users fill out. In addition, if you display multiple text input fields in a window, be sure they all have the same length.
