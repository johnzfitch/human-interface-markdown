The following definition of a word applies in the United States, Canada, and some other countries. In many countries, the definition differs to reflect local formats for numbers, dates, and currency. Double-clicking a character *not* in the list below results in the selection of only that character.  
A word is defined as any continuous string that contains any of the following characters:  
- a letter
- a digit
- a nonbreaking space (Option-space or Command-space)
- a currency symbol (\$, ¢, £, ¥)
- a percent sign
- a comma between digits
- a period before a digit
- an apostrophe between letters or digits
- a hyphen, but not Option-hyphen (–) or Option-Shift-hyphen (—)  
These are examples of words:  
- \$123,456.78
- shouldn't
- 3 1/2 (with a nonbreaking space)
- .5%  
These are examples of strings treated as more than one word:  
- 7/10/6
- blue cheese (with a regular space)
- "Wow!" (The quotation marks and exclamation point are not part of the word.)  
In some contexts—in a programming language, for example—it may be appropriate to allow users to select both the left and right parentheses (or braces or brackets) in a pair, as well as all the characters between them, by double-clicking either one of them. That would mean that a user could select the entire expression  
$$[x+y-(4*3)^{n-1}]$$  
by double-clicking [ or ].
