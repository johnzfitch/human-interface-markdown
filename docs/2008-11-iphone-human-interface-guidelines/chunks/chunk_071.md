The user interfaces of iPhone applications are characterized by beautiful images and lush color. As an application designer, you want to fit into this environment by providing an aesthetically pleasing user interface. Although iPhone OS provides a wide range of elegant and attractive user interface elements, there are two custom elements every application needs: an application icon and a launch image. In addition, some applications need to provide a settings icon to display in the Settings application. This chapter describes how to design these things.  
This chapter also describes how to design icons you can use to represent application-specific functions and modes in navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars. When you follow the guidelines for creating these icons, you can achieve results that both harmonize with the built-in icons and subtly accentuate your application's style.
