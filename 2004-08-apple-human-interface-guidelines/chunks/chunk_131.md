A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (show or hide) while the parent window is open. A drawer should contain frequently accessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. A drawer's contents should be closely related to the contents of its parent window. A drawer automatically inherits the brushed metal appearance if its parent window is brushed metal (see ["Brushed Metal Windows"](#page-110-0) (page 111).

**Cocoa:** Drawers support is available via the NSDrawer class.
