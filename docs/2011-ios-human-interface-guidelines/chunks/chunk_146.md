Userstap a detail disclosure button to reveal additional information or functionality related to a specific item. The additional details or functionality are revealed in a separate view.  
When a detail disclosure button appears in a table row, tapping elsewhere in the row does not activate the detail disclosure button; instead, it selects the row item or results in application-defined behavior.
