A document window should display the name of the document being viewed. Application windows displaythe application name. Utilitywindows displaya descriptive title appropriate forthatwindow. If the contents of the window can change, it might be appropriate to change the title to reflect the current context. For example, in the Keynote inspector, the title of the window changes to reflect which pane has been selected.  
If you need to display more than one item in the title, separate the items with an em dash (—) with space on either side. For example, the main viewer window of Mail displays the currently selected message mailbox and the selected folder, if any. Note that if a message is viewed in its own window, the message title is displayed.  
Don't display pathnames in window titles. When displaying document titles, use the display name and show the extension if the user has selected to show extensions.
