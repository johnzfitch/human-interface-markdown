<span id="page-194-1"></span>Document windows can include a **proxy icon** in the title bar after the content is saved for the first time. After pressing a proxy icon for a brief period, users can manipulate it asif they were manipulating the corresponding file-system object. For example, you can attach a document to an email message by dragging its proxy icon into the email message, as shown in Figure 14-9.

<span id="page-194-2"></span>A proxy icon appears in its normal state as long as the state of the document and the file-system object are the same. When a document has unsaved changes, its proxy icon appears dimmed. Note the difference between the proxy icon in the document with unsaved changes versus the document with saved changes in Figure 14-10.

<span id="page-195-2"></span>Command-clicking the title or the proxy icon displays a pop-up menu illustrating the document path (note that you do not place a standard pop-up menu control in the title bar to provide this behavior). As shown in Figure 14-11, the document path displays the document itself and all containing folders up to the volume that contains the user's home directory. Because Mac OS X is a multiple-user environment, it's especially important to show the complete path of a document to avoid confusion.
