#### Is your product consistent

- within itself?
- with earlier versions of your product?
- with Macintosh interface standards?
- in its use of metaphors?
- with people's expectations?

Note that the most difficult kind of consistency to achieve is matching people's expectations. Because you often face a wide audience and a range of expertise, it's difficult to meet the expectations of everyone. You can address this problem by carefully weighing the consistency issues in the context of your target audience and their needs.
