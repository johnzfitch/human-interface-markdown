<span id="page-122-1"></span>When an item is dragged from an application to the desktop, a clipping is created that contains the data in the dragged item. If discontinuous selections are dragged from a source to the Finder, a separate clipping is created for each selected item.  
Your application should provide a number of representations (such as TEXT, PICT, and native formats) to ensure flexibility with different subsequent destinations. Regardless of which representations are stored, round-trip data integrity should be preserved; a clipping dragged back into its source should be identical to the original item.

<span id="page-124-0"></span>Although MacOS X uses graphics as a primary means of user-computer interaction, text is prevalent throughout the interface for such things as button names, pop-up menu labels, dialog messages, and onscreen help. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of interface design.  
Your product development team should include a skilled writer who isresponsible for reviewing all user-visible onscreen text as well the instructional documentation. The writer should refer to the *Apple Publications Style Guide* for guidance on Apple-specific terminology.
