People primarily see software as a functional product, not a fashion product. This means you want them to notice what your product does, not how it looks. Don't succumb to the temptation to load up with the latest interface fads; they'll quickly become dated. Since people will spend a lot of time with your product, design it to be pleasant to look at for a long time. A spare, clean interface will stand up to repeated viewing much better than a highly decorative interface. For example, the built-in Setup application has lots of non-functional decorative elements to make a user's first Newton experience a friendly one, but the built-in applications that people use daily have none of that decoration.  
Make sure you follow the graphic language of the interface. Don't invent new interface elements to replace existing ones, and don't change the function of standard interface elements. If you change the look of standard interface elements, people will actually try to make up functional reasons for the differences. If you square off the corners of your buttons, use unique view borders, or use a different symbol to designate a pop-up, people will waste time trying to figure out what your custom elements do that the standard ones don't. It won't occur to people that you merely have your own notion of how the interface elements should look.
