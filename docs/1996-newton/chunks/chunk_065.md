Users expect to be able to move views that have matte borders. To move a view, a user puts the pen on the drag handle and drags to a new location. [Figure 2-26](#page-77-0) points out a drag handle.  
Moving a view doesn't affect the appearance of its contents. A main view can't be moved off the screen, and an auxiliary view can't be moved outside the bounds of the main view (unless the auxiliary view is a child of the root view).
