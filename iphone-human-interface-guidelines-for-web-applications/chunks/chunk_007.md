Obviously, users use and perceive iPhone very differently than they do a desktop or even a laptop computer. This may seem like an unnecessary statement, but it is an observation that is crucial to keep in mind as you create content for iPhone, especially if you're an experienced application developer. This is because you may have to work to shift your perspective away from a computer-centric world view, even if your expertise lies in web content creation. It's essential to keep in mind, for example, that instead of the layered windows, desktop, mouse, and file system with which you're familiar, iPhone has a small, fixed screen size, a browser interface supplied by Safari on iPhone, a touch-based input system, and no accessible file system.  
Regardless of these differencesin platform, however, your main goal as a web content developer isthe same: to capture users' imagination and earn their loyalty with a solution that is functional, focused, and enjoyable to use.  
iPhone users are accepting of, and even anticipating, an experience different from the one they are accustomed to on a desktop computer, a laptop, or even a mobile phone. Although this affords you a certain latitude for experimentation, be aware that iPhone users are likely to be even less tolerant of sluggish performance and a complicated user interface than they are when it comes to software running in a computer. In addition, users quickly become accustomed to the elegant, functional, and streamlined user interface of the built-in applications and features, which sets a standard by which they're apt to judge other content.  
There are, of course, similarities between the computer and iPhone environments, too. The most notable similarity, from the perspective of user experience and the user interface, is that most of the characteristics that define great computer applications also define great iPhone webpages and applications, whether built-in or external. Qualitiessuch asresponsiveness,simplicity, ease of use, and consistency are at least asimportant in iPhone content as they are in computer applications. To learn more about these qualities and how to build them into your web content, see "Principles and [Guidelines](#page-20-0) for Creating Great iPhone Content" (page 21).  
Othersimilarities are evident at the content implementation level. Accepted best practicesfor website design and implementation are wholly applicable to iPhone content design and implementation (for an overview of these guidelines, see Creating Compatible Web Content). If you're in the habit of following web design best practices when you target desktop browsers, you're well on your way to creating content that displays well on iPhone. Following the user experience and user interface guidelines in the rest of this document will help you build on that expertise so you can create best-in-class iPhone content.  
Ultimately, iPhone users may determine additional qualities that characterize the most successful iPhone products. As iPhone content evolves and you discover new ways to provide functionality to users, new best practices will emerge.
