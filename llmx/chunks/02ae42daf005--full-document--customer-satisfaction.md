#### **Customer Satisfaction**

If you discover physical defects in the manuals distributed with an Apple product or in the media on which a software product is distributed, Apple will replace the documentation or media at no charge to you during the 90-day period after you purchased the product.

In addition, if Apple releases a corrective update to a software product during the 90-day period after you purchased the software, Apple will replace the applicable diskettes and documentation with the revised version at no charge to you during the six months after the date of purchase

In some countries the replacement period may be different; check with your authorized Apple dealer. Return any item to be replaced with proof of purchase to Apple or an authorized Apple dealer.
