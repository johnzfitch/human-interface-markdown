The **window header** is designed to be a simple way to present information about a window's contents. It is a familiar feature of the Finder, but it can also be implemented in document windows.  
<span id="page-50-0"></span>The window header is a beveled rectangle whose outside lines share the same space as the inside lines of the document window and the scroll bar arrows. There is a also a **window list view header**, which provides the same functionality as the standard window header, but removes the line which separates a standard window header from the content area. Figure 2-43 shows an example of a window header and a window list view header.
