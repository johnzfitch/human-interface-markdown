#### What is color?  
Color is made up of three elements:  
- Hue is what is usually meant by "color": whether it's red, blue, green, or yellow, and so on.
- Saturation is the purity of a color—rich, intense colors are highly saturated; dull or diluted colors are not very saturated. For example, pink is a low-saturation red; brown is a high-saturation orange.

Brightness is how light or dark a color is—how much white is in it. Some
pure hues are naturally brighter than others: yellow is the lightest hue;
violet is the darkest. Bright colors attract the eye.
