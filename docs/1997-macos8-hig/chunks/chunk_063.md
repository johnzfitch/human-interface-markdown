When you measure an edit text field, don't include the bevel outside the black border.  
The standard height of an edit text field is 22 pixels. If you are aligning the field with a 20-pixel high item, such as a pop-up menu button, you can use a height of 20 pixels, reducing the white space from 2 pixels to 1.  
<span id="page-82-0"></span>When you stack edit text fields, leave a minimum distance of 6 pixels between the controls. Figure 3-30 shows the spacing and height of edit text fields.
