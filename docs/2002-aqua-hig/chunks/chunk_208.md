A block of text is a string of characters. A text selection is a substring of this string, which has any length from zero characters to the whole block.  
The **insertion point** (a zero-length text selection) shows where text will be inserted when the user starts typing, or where the contents of the Clipboard will be pasted. The user establishes the location of the insertion point by clicking somewhere in the text; the insertion point appears at the nearest character boundary. If the user clicks  
Selecting **189**  
anywhere to the right of the last character on a line, the insertion point appears immediately after the last character. If the user clicks to the left of the first character on a line, the insertion point appears immediately before the first character.  
Selected text in an active window displays the highlight color chosen by the user in General preferences. When the window becomes inactive, the text should remain highlighted, but in the secondary color, which is a percentage of the original highlight color. When the window becomes active again, the text selection displays in the primary highlight color. Both Carbon and Cocoa contain functions that return the current highlight color, as well as other important colors in the user interface. Your application should use these defined colors in any custom controls you create, rather than hard-coding in specific color values.
