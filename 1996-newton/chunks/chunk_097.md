A list picker can pop up from a text button or text label marked with a black diamond (◆). In addition, a picker can pop up from a picture button or a hot spot, but for aesthetic reasons picture buttons and hot spots are not marked with black diamonds. [Figure 4-5](#page-133-0) shows pickers from those four sources.

For picker control at the bottom of a view or on the status bar, use text or picture buttons. Elsewhere in a view, label pickers usually look best.
