Don't use sheets in the following situations:  
- <span id="page-231-3"></span>■ For dialogs that apply to several windows. Use sheets only when a particular dialog is associated with only one window.
- For modeless operations in which the dialog should be left open to allow the user to observe the effects of changes applied. Such tasks (find and replace operations, for example) are better suited to modeless dialogs, panels, or drawers.
- <span id="page-231-0"></span>■ On a window that doesn't have a title bar. Sheets should emerge from a definite visual edge.
- <span id="page-231-2"></span>■ When the user will need information in the window that is essential to filling in requested information in the dialog.
