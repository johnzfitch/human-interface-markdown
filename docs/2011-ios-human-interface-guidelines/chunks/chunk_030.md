When virtual objects and actions in an application are metaphors for objects and actions in the real world, users quickly grasp how to use the app. The classic example of a software metaphor is the folder: People put things in folders in the real world, so they immediately understand the idea of putting files into folders on a computer.  
The most appropriate metaphors suggest a usage or experience without enforcing the limitations of the real-world object or action on which they're based. For example, people can fill software folders with much more content than would fit in a physical folder.

Human Interface Principles  
iOS provides great scope for metaphors because it supports rich graphical images and gestures. People physically interact with realistic onscreen objects, in many cases operating them as if they were real-world objects. Metaphors in iOS include:  
- Tapping iPod playback controls
- Dragging, flicking, or swiping objects in a game
- Sliding On/Off switches
- Flicking through pages of photos
- Spinning picker wheels to make choices  
In general, metaphors work best when they're not stretched too far. For example, the usability of software folders would decrease if they had to be organized into a virtual filing cabinet.
