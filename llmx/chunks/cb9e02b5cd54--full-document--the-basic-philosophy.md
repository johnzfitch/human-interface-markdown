## The Basic Philosophy

The first part of this book presents the key design principles and considerations for developers to keep in mind when creating a product that works with Macintosh computers. It suggests ways to incorporate human interface into your product design and decision-making processes. It also describes how to involve users in your product design process to ensure that you've built a product that serves your users well and conforms to the guidelines.
