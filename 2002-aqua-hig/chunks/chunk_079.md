Your application should open a document window when a user does any of the following:  
- double-clicks a document icon in the Finder
- selects the document in the Finder and chooses open from the File menu (or selects the document and presses Command-O in the Finder)
- chooses a file from within an Open dialog
- chooses the New command from the File menu
- <span id="page-73-6"></span>■ clicks the application icon in the Dock when no documents are open  
<span id="page-73-1"></span>When your application displays a new document window, name it "untitled"; leaving it lowercase makes it more obvious that the window doesn't have a name and encourages people to save the document. If the user chooses New again before saving the first untitled window, name the second window "untitled 2," and so on. Add numbers to window titles only when there is more than one open untitled window. Don't put a "1" on the first untitled window, even after the user opens other new windows.

<span id="page-73-5"></span><span id="page-73-4"></span><span id="page-73-3"></span>If the user dismisses all untitled windows by saving or closing them, then the next new document should start over as "untitled," the next should be "untitled 2," and so on. If a user has chosen to display filename extensions in Finder Preferences, the extension should appear on the title of a new untitled window ("untitled.rtf," for example).

<span id="page-74-3"></span><span id="page-74-2"></span><span id="page-74-1"></span>When the user opens an existing document, make sure its title is the **display name,** which reflects the user's preference for showing or hiding its filename extension. For more information, see ["Naming Files and Showing Filename Extensions"](#page-248-1) [\(page 249\).](#page-248-1) Don't display pathnames in document titles (see ["Displaying](#page-250-0)  [Pathnames" \(page 251\)\)](#page-250-0).
