The user can select a range of text by dragging. A range can consist of characters, words, lines, or paragraphs, as defined by the application.  
In text fields, clicking should perform the following actions:  
- <span id="page-103-1"></span>■ Single-clicking places the insertion point at the pointer's location in the text.
- Double-clicking within a word selects the word. The selection should provide "smart" behavior; if the user deletes the selectedword, for example, the space after theword should also be deleted.
- Double-clicking in a space selects the space.
- <span id="page-103-0"></span>■ Triple-clicking selects the next logical unit, as defined by the application. In a word-processing document, triple-clicking in a word selects the paragraph containing the word.
