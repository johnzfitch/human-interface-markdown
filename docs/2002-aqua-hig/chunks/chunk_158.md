<span id="page-159-3"></span>Small versions of controls are available in Carbon and Cocoa. Use the smaller versions only when absolutely necessary, and use them sparingly. When converting existing dialogs for use with Aqua, redesign layouts as necessary, rather than relying on the smaller versions of controls. Your first choice in designing for Aqua should always be to use the full-size controls.  
You can use small versions of controls when space is at an extreme premium, such as in tool palettes or other utility windows. Avoid mixing full-size and small versions of controls in the same window. In a tabbed window, it is acceptable to use small controls within the pane and standard controls outside the pane. However, all panes of a tabbed window should use the same-size controls.

<span id="page-162-5"></span><span id="page-162-0"></span>Like other graphical user interfaces, Mac OS X is optimized for use with a pointing device, such as a mouse. Many users, however, prefer or need to interact with the computer using the keyboard instead of the mouse. In Mac OS X (version 10.1 and later), users have the option of enabling keyboard access for all functions available using a point-and-click device.
