Use a group box when you want users to understand logical groupings of controls in a window. You can use group boxes in the window-body area, including within tab-view panes.  
Although group boxes are very useful for separating logical collections of content, avoid nesting them when possible; nested group boxes use a lot ofspace, and it can be difficult to perceive individual boundaries when group boxes are nested too deeply. Instead, consider using a separator or white space to group content within a group box. (See ["Separators"](#page-331-1) (page 332) for more information on using separators; see ["Grouping](#page-348-1) with White [Space"](#page-348-1) (page 349) for guidance on using white space.) Strive to place roughly equal numbers of controls in each group box in a window, to create a visually balanced appearance.
