## **Ending**

The user is given a way out of the program. Even if your program is on a copy-protected disk and there really is no way out, give the user an End option and then tell him that he may now insert another disk and press RETURN, or whatever. Users feel positively trapped by programs with seemingly no end; they forget that the power switch solves all.

BASIC programs should also reset and clear Hires screens and revert to normal text condition upon a normal exit in order to prevent interference with other unrelated programs.

The programs should also reset other system parameters to customary settings.

The balance of this document presents more concrete guidelines for specific program areas.
