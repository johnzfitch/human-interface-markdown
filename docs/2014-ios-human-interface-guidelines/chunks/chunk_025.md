People use gestures—such astap, drag, and pinch—to interact with apps and their iOS devices. Using gestures gives people a close personal connection to their devices and enhances their sense of direct manipulation of onscreen objects. People generally expect gestures to work the same in all the apps they use.

In addition to the standard gestures users know, iOS defines a few gestures that invoke systemwide actions, such as revealing Control Center or Notification Center. Users rely on these gestures to work regardless of the app they're using.  
**Avoid associating different actions with the standard gestures.** Unless your app is a game, redefining the meaning of a standard gesture may confuse people and make your app harder to use.  
**Avoid creating custom gestures that invoke the same actions as the standard gestures.** People are used to the behavior of the standard gestures, and they don't appreciate being expected to learn different ways to do the same thing.  
**Use complex gestures as shortcuts to expedite a task, not as the only way to perform it.** As much as possible, always give users a simple, straightforward way to perform an action, even if it means an extra tap or two. Simple gestures let users focus on the experience and the content, not the interaction.  
**In general, avoid defining new gestures unless your app is a game.** In games and other immersive apps, custom gestures can be a fun part of the experience. But in apps that help people do things that are important to them, it's best to use standard gestures because people don't have to make an effort to discover them or remember them.  
<span id="page-40-0"></span>**ForiPad, consider using multifinger gestures.** The large iPad screen provides greatscope for custom multifinger gestures, including gestures made by more than one person. Although complex gestures aren't appropriate for every app, they can enrich the experience in apps that people spend a lot of time in, such as games or content-creation environments. Always bear in mind that nonstandard gestures aren't discoverable and should rarely, if ever, be the only way to perform an action.
