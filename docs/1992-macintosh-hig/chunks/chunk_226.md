Apple Computer, Inc., publishes the *Apple Publications Style Guide,* which codifies the way in which Apple documentation uses language. This publication contains information about the specific terms that are used to describe interface elements. It also defines style and usage issues such as how certain terms are used and the preferred capitalization, spelling, and hyphenation of those terms. Some parts of the style guide are excerpted in this chapter to provide quick reference for key elements of the user interface. Whenever you are constructing language for your application, you can consult the *Apple Publications Style Guide* to help you to create consistent and usable language. You can obtain this publication through APDA.  
For issues that aren't covered in the *Apple Publications Style Guide*, publication departments at Apple Computer rely on three other works: *The American Heritage Dictionary, The Chicago Manual of Style,* and *Words Into Type.* In cases where these reference books give conflicting rules, *The Chicago Manual of Style*  takes precedence for questions of usage and *The American Heritage Dictionary*  for questions of spelling.
