A good alert message states clearly what caused the alert to appear and what the user can do about it. Express everything in the user's vocabulary. Here's an example of an alert message that provides little useful information:  
<span id="page-232-0"></span>**Figure 13-1** A poorly written alert message

You could improve this message by describing the problem in the user's vocabulary:  
<span id="page-232-1"></span>**Figure 13-2** An improved alert message

<span id="page-232-2"></span>To really make the alert useful, provide a suggestion about what the user can do to get out of the current situation:  
<span id="page-233-0"></span>**Figure 13-3** A well-written alert message

With Apple Help, you can display HTML files in Help Viewer, a browser-like application designed for displaying onscreen help documents. Help Viewer can also display documents with QuickTime content, open AppleScript-based automations, retrieve updated help content from the Internet, and provide context-sensitive assistance.  
<span id="page-234-5"></span><span id="page-234-3"></span>Help tags, which replace the help balloons introduced in System 7, give your application the ability to identify its interface elements and provide basic help information without forcing the user to leave the primary interface.
