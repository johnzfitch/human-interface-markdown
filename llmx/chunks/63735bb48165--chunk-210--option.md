#### Option  
The Option key, when used in combination with other keys, produces a set of international characters and special symbols. For example, in many Macintosh fonts, Option-4 produces the ¢ symbol, Option-R produces ®, and Option-G produces ©. Shift and Option can be used together, in combination with a character key, to produce yet other symbols. For example, Option-Shift-? produces the Spanish ¿ character. The Key Caps desk accessory lets the user preview these combinations in all available fonts.  
The Option key can also be used in conjunction with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. For example, in some graphics applications, if the user selects an object and holds down the Option key while dragging the object, the application makes a copy of the object and moves it to wherever the user releases the mouse button. This example is illustrated in Figure 10-11.
