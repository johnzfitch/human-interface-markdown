Text buttons and picture buttons are easiest to use at the bottom of the view that contains them. In that position a user's hand won't cover the view while tapping a button. Buttons that affect all items in a main view should go on a status bar at the bottom of the main view (see ["Primary Controls and Status](#page-54-0)  [Bar" on page 2-11\)](#page-54-0). The status bar is optional if the main view is small, like the main views of the built-in Connection, Card, and Time Zones applications. Buttons at the bottom of a slip or other auxiliary view are generally not on a status bar.  
In a view that displays multiple items, each item is headed by a separator bar (see ["Separator Bars" on page 2-11](#page-54-0)). Buttons that apply to only one item do not go at the bottom of the view. Instead, the buttons are attached to each item's separator bar, and they scroll along with the item when a user scrolls the view. For example, a Filing button and an Action button go at the right end of each separator bar (see ["Filing Button" on page 3-27](#page-120-0) and ["Action](#page-121-0)  [Button" on page 3-28](#page-121-0)). Other buttons can go on a button bar that floats near the end of an item. [Figure 3-11](#page-105-0) shows buttons on a separator bar, buttons on a floating button bar, and buttons on a status bar.  
It's possible for your application to add buttons to another application's status bar. For example, your application could add a button to the backdrop application's status bar so users could bring your application to the front without going through the Extras Drawer. This could be a boon or a nightmare depending on how crowded the status bar is in the backdrop application. If you want to add a button to another application, make sure users can disable the feature.

#### Button Spacing 3  
Group text and picture buttons with similar functions together. Users assume buttons near each other are related. Generally, buttons that directly control or take action are on the right, and buttons that affect content or appearance are on the left. Separate the left and right groups with blank space, if the number and sizes of buttons permit. Figure 3-12 shows buttons groups at the right and left sides of a container view, with a gap separating the two groups.

<span id="page-106-0"></span>Avoid spacing consecutive buttons so close together that they look cramped. On an Apple MessagePad, space consecutive buttons in a group three pixels apart, and leave four pixels between buttons and the view's border. If you must, you can reduce the space between consecutive buttons to two pixels, but no less. Figure 3-13 illustrates the MessagePad guidelines.

If your application changes a button's name, it should dynamically resize the button and maintain the correct spacing between buttons. Your application should maintain the correct spacing between buttons when a user rotates the display (with the Extras Drawer). Accommodate the changing width of a view by adding or taking away space between groups of buttons. Your application also needs to maintain the spacing between buttons if their names change during operation.
