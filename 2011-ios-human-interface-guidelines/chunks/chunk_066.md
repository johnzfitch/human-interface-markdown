Rich, beautiful, engaging graphics draw people into an application and make the simplest task rewarding. Beautiful artwork also helps to build your app's brand in people's eyes. iOS-based devices showcase your application's artwork, so you should consider hiring a professional artist to create first-rate graphics that people will admire.  
**Consider replicating the look of high-quality or precious materials**. If the effect of wood, leather, or metal is appropriate in your application, take the time to make sure the material looks realistic and valuable. For example, Notes reproduces the look of fine leather and meticulous stitching.

**When appropriate, create high-resolution artwork**. In most cases, scaling up your artwork is not recommended as a long-term solution. Instead, try creating your artwork in a dimension that is larger than you need, so you can add depth and details before scaling it down. This works especially well when the dimension of the original art file is a multiple of the dimension you need. Then, if you also use an appropriate grid size in your image-editing application, you'll be able to keep the scaled-down art file crisp and reduce the amount of retouching and sharpening you need to do.  
**Ensure that your launch images and application icon are high quality**. For guidelines on how to create these, see "Custom Icon and Image Creation [Guidelines"](#page-140-0) (page 141).
