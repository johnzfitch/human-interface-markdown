When space is at a premium, such as in a pop-up menu, you can use contractions, as long as the contracted words aren't critical to the meaning of the phrase. For example, a menu could contain the following items:  
Don't Allow Printing  
Don't Allow Modifying  
Don't Allow Copying  
In these examples, the contraction doesn't alter the operative word for the item. If a contraction does alter the significant word in a phrase, such as "contains" and "does not contain," it's clearer to avoid the contraction.  
As much as possible, avoid using uncommon contractions that may be difficult to interpret and localize. In particular:  
● Avoid forming a contraction using a noun and a verb, such as in the sentence "Apple's going to announce a new computer today."  
● Avoid using less common contractions, such as "it'll" and "should've."
