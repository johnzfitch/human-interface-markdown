### Scrolling by windowful

Clicking the mouse anywhere in the gray area of the scroll bar advances the document by a windowful. The scroll box, and the document view, move toward the place where the user clicked. Clicking below the scroll box, for example, brings the user the next windowful toward the bottom of the document. Pressing in the gray area causes the display of consecutive windowfuls until the user releases the mouse button, or until the location of the scroll box catches up to the location of the pointer. Each windowful is the height or width of the window, minus one unit overlap (where a unit is the distance the view scrolls when the scroll arrow is clicked once), so that <sup>a</sup> little of the previous information is shown as a reference point. Vertical scrolling by windowful can also be done using function keys on some keyboards (see "Function Keys" for details).
