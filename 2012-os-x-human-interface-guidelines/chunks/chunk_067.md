Sharing allows users to share content directly from your app. The Share menu automatically includes some built-in services like AirDrop and Mail, but it only displays the services that make sense to share with that specific service. For example, Flickr (a photo-sharing service) appearsin the Share menu only if you are viewing a photo. You can also customize the menu to allow users to share to other services. In Safari, users can add a webpage to their reading list, bookmark it, or share it via Mail, Message, or Twitter, as shown here.

As you implement and customize the Share menu in your app, consider the following guidelines.  
**In general, use the Share button for content users wantto share with other people.** When deciding whether to add a Share button in your app, consider whether users want to share their content with other people. This includes sending content directly via AirDrop, Mail, and Message, or posting it to a social sharing service such as Facebook, YouTube, or Flickr.  
In particular, do not use the Share menu to edit content or to pass content between apps. For example, QuickTime Player uses a separate Export menu to send files to iTunes and iMovie or to reformat a file. Use an Action Menu for other actions that users may want to perform with their content, such as Duplicate, Move to Trash, or Get Info. The Share menu should not replace the Action menu. See ["Action](#page-262-0) Menu" (page 263) for more information.  
**Add a Share item in your File menu.** Users should be able to share their content from the File menu as well as with the Share button. Make sure to provide the same menu items in both places. It's also best to use the same wording so that users readily recognize the available options.  
**List built-in OS X services first in the Share menu.** If you add other services to the Share menu, make sure to list them after OS X apps (such as Mail, Message, and AirDrop). This order ensures a consistent user experience across all apps.  
**Use a verb to label actions in the share menu (and a verb phrase for the first action).** For example, you might label your actions: Email this Page (not Mail), followed by Message, AirDrop, and so forth.  
**Use title-style capitalization to label services.** As with all menu-item names, use title-style capitalization for the service title and, in general, avoid including definite or indefinite articles. (For more information about capitalization in the UI, see ["Capitalizing](#page-305-0) Labels and Text" (page 306).)  
With Sharing Service on OS X, you can also integrate features of a specific social networking service directly into your app. For example, users can view the Facebook profile and photos of their contacts from a menu item in the Contacts app (as shown here). You can also generate HTTP requests to get and push content from available social services. Users appreciate when they can share content they care about and can view relevant social information from within your app.
