#### **Programming Note:** Tools for **Creating Menus**  
Project Builder creates your application's main menu. You can add commands and menus using Interface Builder. Some standard commands provided by Interface Builder have actions or submenus already associated with them. For example, by dragging the Windows command from the Palettes window of Interface Builder into your application's main menu, you give your application the full functionality described in I'The Windows Menu," later in this chapter.
