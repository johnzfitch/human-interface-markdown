Pressing the Home key is equivalent to moving the scrollers all the way to the top and to the left. In a text document, for example, pressing Home scrolls to the beginning of the document; in a spreadsheet, it may scroll to the beginning of the spreadsheet or to the beginning of a row.  
End is the opposite of Home: It scrolls to the end of a document.  
If the beginning or end of the document is already reached, pressing Home or End produces a system alert sound. *Pressing the Home or End key has no effect on the location of the insertion point or selected data.*
