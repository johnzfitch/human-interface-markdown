The movable part of a linear slider is called the thumb. The thumb can be either directional or round. The directional thumb is especially useful for sliders with tick marks, because the point of the thumb helps show users the current value (see [Figure](#page-295-1) 15-48 (page 296) for examples of directional slider thumbs). However, you  
<span id="page-297-1"></span>can also display a directional-thumb slider without tick marks. The round thumb is recommended for sliders that don't display tick marks, because the rounded lower edge of the thumb does not appear to point to a specific value. (If you use Interface Builder to create a slider, note that specifying any nonzero number of tick marks automatically changes a round thumb to a directional one.) Figure 15-50 shows an example of slider with a round thumb.

A circular slider displays a small circular dimple that provides the same functionality as the thumb of a linear slider: Users drag the dimple clockwise or counter-clockwise to change the values.  
If you want to display tick marks with a slider, be sure to label at least the starting and ending values. You can do this using numbers or words, depending on what the values represent. If each tick mark represents an equal fraction of the entire range, it may not be necessary to label each one. However, if users can't deduce the value of each tick mark from its position in the range, you probably should label each one to prevent confusion. For example, it's important to label some of the interior tick marks in Energy Saver preferences (shown in [Figure](#page-295-1) 15-48 (page 296)), because the intervals do not all represent an equal amount of time. In addition, it's a good idea to set the context for a slider with an introductory label so users know what they're changing. Figure 15-51 shows both types of sliders, with and without tick marks.
