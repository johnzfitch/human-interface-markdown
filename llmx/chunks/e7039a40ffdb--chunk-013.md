Pressing the mouse button while pointing anywhere on a passive folder makes that one the active folder, and the previously active folder becomes passive. A folder may also be made active or passive by an application. If this might happen when the user is not expecting it or may not be looking at the screen, a beep should occur as notification.  
Even a closed folder can be made the active folder. Since its body is not visible no scrollbars appear; only its thickened tab distinguishes it as the active folder.
