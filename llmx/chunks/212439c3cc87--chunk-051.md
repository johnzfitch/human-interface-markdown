Selecting the single object of an operation then choosing a menu command works well whenever operations are simple and act on only one object. For those times when a command requires more than one object or needs additional information before it can be executed, the Apple Desktop Interface provides:  
- Dialogs, to allow the user to provide the needed additional information before a command is executed
- Alerts, to notify the user whenever an unusual situation occurs  
Because dialogs and alerts often use controls, controls are described in this section, even though they're also used in other kinds of windows.
