# Icons

- Do your icons represent objects that users are familiar with?
- Do your icons fit in with the desktop metaphor?
- Do you provide complete icon families, with 'ICN#', 'ics#', 'icl4', 'ics4', 'icl8', and 'ics8' icons?
- Are icon colors chosen from the palette of 34 colors?
- If your application supports stationery pads, the Edition Manager, or the Data Access Manager, do you provide icons that distinguish the stationery pads, editions, or query documents for your application?
