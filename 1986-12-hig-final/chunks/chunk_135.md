If the computer is doing something time-consuming, and the user may have turned away from the screen, sound is a good way to let the user know that the process is finished, or it needs attention. (There should also be an indication on the screen, of course.)  
#### Alerts  
Common alerts can use sounds other than the SysBeep for their first stage or two before bringing up an alert box. For example, when the user tries to paste when there's nothing in the Clipboard, or tries to backspace past the top of a field, different sounds could alert them.  
#### Modes  
If your application has different states or modes, each one can have a particular sound when it is entered or exited. This can emphasize the current mode, and prevent confusion.
