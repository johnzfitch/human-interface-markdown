#### **Moving the Insertion Point** ,-  
The Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys move the insertion point one character left and right, respectively.  
Up Arrow and Down Arrow move the insertion point up and down one line, respectively.  
Horizontal screen position is maintained in terms of screen pixels, but not necessarily in tenns of characters. (Character boundaries seldom line up vertically when proportional  
fonts are used.) When the insertion point moves to a new line, it may also move slightly left or right, to the nearest character boundary on the new line. During successive movements up or down, the application should keep the insertion point as close as possible to the original horizontal position as it moves from line to line.
