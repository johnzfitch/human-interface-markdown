The width of the left pane of a split view is fixed at 320 points in all orientations. Users cannot resize either pane of a split view.  
**Note:** Even though the left pane is often called the *master pane* and the right pane is often called the *detail pane*, this relationship is not enforced in code.  
Both panes can contain a wide variety of objects and views, such as:  
- Table, image, map, text, web, or custom views.
- Navigation bars, toolbars, or tab bars.
