The mouse controls the movement of the cursor on-screen. Typically, the user moves the cursor over an object in the workspace and presses a mouse button to make something happen. With the mouse, the user can edit documents, rearrange windows, and operate any control. The mouse is the essential tool of a graphical interface.  
Users can manipulate the mouse injust two ways:  
- Move it to position the cursor. The standard arrow cursor "points to" the object touched by its tip. (The cursor is also said to be positioned "over" the object at its tip.)
- Press and release the mouse buttons. The NeXTTM mouse has two buttons, one on the right and one on the left. Initially, both buttons work alike, but they can be differentiated by the Preferences application (see "Left and Right Orientation" later in this chapter).  
From these two simple actions, a few basic mouse operations are derived:  
- Clicking
- Multiple-clicking
- Dragging
- Pressing
