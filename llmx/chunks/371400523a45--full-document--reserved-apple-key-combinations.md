### *Reserved Apple Key Combinations*

There are several menu items, particularly in the File and Edit menus, that commonly have keyboard equivalents. Keyboard equivalents are provided for people who prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard instead of using a pointing device to choose operations from menus. For the sake of consistency, several of those keyboard equivalents should be used only for the operations listed below and should never be used for any other purpose.

Keyboard equivalents for menu operations are case-independent. In other words, both Apple-S and Apple-s mean *Save.* The keyboard equivalent for *Help* in the Apple menu is shown as Apple-?, but it doesn't actually require that the Shift key be used. The keyboard equivalents are shown in the menus as capital letters just for consistency and aesthetics. Modifier-key combinations other than the ones listed here should also be case-independent. Except for its usual function of providing uppercase characters, the Shift key should be used as a modifier key only as a last resort.

| Menu<br>Apple |       |
|---------------|-------|
| Apple-?       | Help  |
| Menu<br>File  |       |
| Apple-N       | New   |
| Apple-O       | Open  |
| Apple-S       | Save  |
| Apple-Q       | Quit  |
| Edit<br>Menu  |       |
| Apple-Z       | Undo  |
| Apple-X       | Cut   |
| Apple-C       | Copy  |
| Apple-V       | Paste |
|               |       |

Many desk accessories (which are accessible from *all* applications) use the Clipboard and must be able to depend on the keyboard equivalents for Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste.

The keyboard equivalent for Quit is important in case there's a mouse malfunction. The user can still leave the application in an orderly way (with a dialog box that accepts the Return key as a Yes response), saving any changes to documents that haven't already been saved.

Note that the Edit menu's four reserved letter keys are in close proximity to each other and to the Apple key, allowing easy one-hand operation.

The keyboard equivalents in the Style menu are less strictly reserved. Applications that have a Style menu shouldn't use these keyboard equivalents for any other purpose, but applications that have no Style menu can use them for any purpose. Remember that you

risk confusing users if a given key combination means different things in different applications.
