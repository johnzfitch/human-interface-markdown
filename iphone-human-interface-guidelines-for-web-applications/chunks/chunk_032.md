For most webpages, the automatic zooming that Safari on iPhone performs in response to user gestures is sufficient to allow users to read the content with ease. For in-depth information on how Safari on iPhone zooms and centers content, see Creating Compatible Web Content. In addition, following web-design best practices, such as avoiding fonts, font colors, and font sizes that are difficult to read, and displaying text in a column format, is probably all you need to do to display clear, easily readable text in your webpage.

**Note:** Even though Safari on iPhone supports a wide range of built-in fonts, it's best to use the most readable fonts, such as Helvetica, for most of the text you display. For example, you may have a good design reason to display a word or two in Zapfino, but using it for all the text on your webpage can make your content difficult to read.  
If you're developing an iPhone web application, on the other hand, you might want to go a bit further to ensure your text is easy to read and helps focus the user's attention on your content. The following list presents guidelines that help you save space and make text more readable in your application:  
- Use a 17-pixel to 22-pixel font.
- Use bold for emphasis, to delineate list items, or to show hierarchy or sort order (see [Figure](#page-37-1) 4-10 (page 38) and [Figure](#page-38-1) 4-11 (page 39) for examples).
- Make each label as succinct as possible, begin it with a capital letter, and do not follow it with a colon.
- Left align text, especially in a list layout.
- Consider avoiding the underlined style for displaying links, because it can make the text appear crowded.
