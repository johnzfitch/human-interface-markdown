## Modifier Keys

Modifier keys are those that alter the way other keystrokes are interpreted. These keys sometimes affect the way the mouse-button actions are interpreted as well. They are the Shift, Caps Lock, Option, Command, and Control keys. Not all Macintosh keyboards contain all of these keys. It is important that you use these keys consistently from application to application, as outlined in these guidelines.
