<span id="page-61-4"></span>Developers may also find some features of the Dock useful for conveying information.  
- <span id="page-61-6"></span>■ Use badging to convey status information in an unobtrusive manner. Badging is the process of superimposing a small image on an application's Dock tile icon. For example, Mail uses a badge to show the number of unread messages. This is a good example of providing appropriate feedback and communication. For more information on this principle of user interface design, see ["Feedback](#page-41-1) and [Communication"](#page-41-1) (page 42).
- <span id="page-61-2"></span>■ Use the Notification Manager to convey more seriousinformation,such as error conditions. Notifications cause your Dock tile icon to bounce. Make sure you disable this effect once the user has addressed the problem. (Note that error-related classesin a Cocoa application initiate Dock notifications automatically.)
