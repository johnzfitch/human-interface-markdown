<span id="page-230-0"></span>A **sheet** is a modal dialog attached to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog appliesto. Because a sheet is attached to the window from which it emerges, a sheet does not have its own title. Figure 14-46 shows an example of a sheet.

The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window helps users take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model (see "Window [Layering"](#page-216-0) (page 217)). Sheets also allow usersto perform other tasks before dismissing the dialog, with no sense of the system being "hijacked" by the application.  
Lay out sheets as you would any other dialog in Mac OS X. For guidelines on laying out a dialog, see "Positioning [Regular-Size](#page-336-1) Controls in a Window Body" (page 337).  
#### **Sheet Behavior**  
Sheets are displayed as an animation that appears to emerge from the window's title bar. When a sheet opens on a window near the edge of the screen and the sheet is wider than the window it's attached to, the sheet movesthe window away from the edge; when the sheet is dismissed, the window returnsto its previous position.  
Only one sheet may be open for a window at any one time. A sheet prevents any other operation on that window until the sheet is dismissed. If, when the user responds to a sheet, another sheet for that document must open, the first sheet closes before the second one opens.  
A sheet on an active document window should cover (appear on top of) any active panels (if necessary). However, if the user leaves a sheet open and clicks another document in the same application, the inactive window and its sheet should go *behind* any open panels.  
<span id="page-231-4"></span>In an application that allows multiple windows for the same document (so that the user can see different parts of a document simultaneously), a sheet is not appropriate. Use an application modal dialog in this situation to make it clear that changes to one window affect other windows in the application.  
In an application that displays multiple documents in a single window at different times, such as in a tabbed browser, a sheet is appropriate even though it applies to only the current document in the view. This is because, in a single-window situation, the user can't move the view and its sheet aside to handle later when choosing to view a different document. Rather, the user in effect dismissesthe view's contents when choosing to view a different document. The usershould therefore dismissthe sheet on the current view before selecting a different document.  
#### <span id="page-231-1"></span>**When to Use Sheets**  
Use sheets for dialogs specific to a document when the user interacts with the dialog and dismisses it before proceeding with work. Here are some examples of when to use sheets:  
- A modal dialog for an activity that is specific to a particular document, such as saving or printing.
- A modal dialog that is specific to a single-window application that does not create documents. A single-window utility program might use a sheet to request acceptance of a licensing agreement from the user, for example.
- Other window-specific dialogs that are typically dismissed by the user before proceeding. Use a sheet when a dialog benefitsfrom being attached to the window as a modal dialog, even if you might otherwise design the dialog as a modeless dialog.
