The fIrst Apple desktop interface, introduced in 1983, drew on work done elsewhere. At SRI International in the 1960s, the Augmentation Research Project introduced the idea of integrated media that would augment human intelligence. This project also introduced "intelligent cut and paste." The mouse, too, was developed at SRI.  
The concept of overlapping windows that can be moved around on a screen, much as papers on a desktop, was developed at Xerox as part of the Smalltalk interactive environment. The graphical menu, one that is always on the screen, originated with CAD systems. Smalltalk features a mouse; two ofits three buttons are used to call menus that "pop up" under the pointer, varying according to which button is pressed and where the pointer is on the screen.  
The desktop metaphor, with icons to represent objects, was developed around 1974 at Xerox and evolved into the Star workstation that was introduced in 1981. The Star's ."plain paper" metaphor means that, for example, that the user can edit a graphic that has been pasted in a text document without leaving the text editor (the tool that created the graphic is always available). Star's impact on software development has been dramatic.  
Though the plain paper metaphor was thought too complex at that time, other Smalltalk features influenced Apple's Lisa project. Scroll bars and consistent text editing were adapted to the Lisa. Lisa's Filer was originally a remember-and-type interface that gave the user the feeling of asking an agent (the Filer) to carry out a task. But after seeing the introduction of the Star, the Lisa team redesigned the Filer, making the desktop metaphor and icons a high priority and taking advantage of Lisa's bit-mapped graphics to provide the directness and visualness they wanted.  
Several now-common interface features appeared ftrst on the Lisa: the menu bar (because most people read left-to-right and top-to-bottom), the one-button mouse (users never have to think about which button to press), dialog boxes, the Clipboard, and the Trashcan. Until Lisa, users couldn't drag icons or make them zoom into overlapping windows.  
Here are the key design concepts of the Lisa, introduced in 1983:  
- bit-mapped display and windows
- mouse as pointing device consistent human interface (and its byproduct, and ease of learning)
- the office desktop metaphor
- multitasking  
(  
(  
Except for multitasking, all of these features were incorporated in the smaller and less expensive Apple Macintosh, introduced in 1984. The Macintosh's popularity and obvious ease of use caused many loyal Apple II users to want a desktop interface for that family of  
computers. Now, several programs are available that give Apple II users the benefits of the mouse, windows, pull—down menus, and icons.
