An adaptable program is one that adjusts appropriately to its surroundings; that is, it does not stop working when the current conditions change. One of the strengths of OS X isits ability to adapt to configuration changes quickly and easily. For example, if the user changes a computer's network configuration in System Preferences, the changes are automatically picked up by apps such as Safari and Mail. Follow the guidelines in this section to ensure that your app is similarly adaptable.  
**Expect people to be mobile.** First of all, be prepared for network configuration changes and make sure that users can benefit from your app when their network connection isslow or nonexistent. For example, be flexible when accessing the file system, in case network volumes go offline. If a network volume disappears, show users that it is unavailable and provide an option to save files to a different volume. (If you want to learn about using Bonjour to publish and discover services, see *Bonjour Overview*.)  
Second, be conservative with your app's power usage so that mobile users can use their computer as long as possible before recharging. For example, avoid polling for events and accessing the hard disk as much as possible. Also, make sure that your app is completely idle unless it is actively processing a user's request. (To start learning how to optimize your app's performance, see *Performance Overview*.)  
**Anticipate variations in display size, resolution, and number.** OS X users can plug in and unplug displays at any time, and these displays might have different sizes and resolutions. Your app should respond gracefully when a display goes away or when a new display has a different size or resolution. Make sure your graphics look good at all resolutions and be prepared to adjust window locations and dimensions.  
**Be prepared for multiple users with different privileges.** The OS X fast user switching feature allows multiple usersto be logged in simultaneously and to switch quickly between accounts. To ensure that your app behaves appropriately when there are multiple users logged in or when the current user has limited privileges, keep the following things in mind:  
Some users may be working under limited privileges and have limited access to some parts of the system. For example, only administrator users can write filesin /Applications. In particular, users with limited privileges may not be able to:  
- Access all panes in System Preferences
- Modify the Dock
- Change their password
- Burn DVDs and CDs
- Open certain apps
- Visit certain websites  
Users on a computer can include both local and network users, so don't assume that a user's home directory is on a local volume. Be prepared for the possibility that you are accessing a network volume instead.  
Named resourcesthat might potentially be accessible to an app from multiple usersessionsshould incorporate the session ID into the name of the resource. This applies to cache files, shared memory, semaphores, and named pipes, among others.  
**Avoid depending on the availability of specific hardware.** Hardware configurations can vary greatly based on the computer, country, and user. For example, not every Macintosh hasthe same graphics card or processor. Similarly, not all keyboards have the same set of keys. Hardware can also be added or removed at runtime. To detect available device configurations, you can use the I/OKitinterfacesthat are described in *Accessing Hardware From Applications*.  
**Avoid making assumptions based on the current user's locale.** Be prepared to handle different date, time, and number formats. Also, don't assume that the address format of the current user is the only address format in use. For example, in Contacts the user may store contacts with foreign addresses.  
To make sure your user interface adapts gracefully to changes in locale (especially when users switch to right-to-left languages), use Cocoa Auto Layout as described in "Auto [Layout"](#page-96-0) (page 97).
