A list picker that pops up from a button or text label should appear next to the label or button but should not completely cover the label or button, so users can see where the picker comes from. If a picker is too wide to fit in the space next to the picker label or button, the picker should appear below (or above) and flush with the label or button.  
If possible, a list picker should line up with the top edge of the label or button that makes it appear. If top alignment would cause the picker to extend past the bottom of the screen, then the picker should line up with the bottom of the label or button that makes it appear. A long picker (or a short screen) may require aligning the top or bottom of the picker to the top or bottom of the screen. [Figure 4-6](#page-134-0) illustrates proper and improper alignment of list pickers and the labels or buttons that make them appear.

If you want your application to work when a user rotates the display (with the Extras Drawer's Rotate button), your application may need to make picker alignment dependent on screen size.
