Another way to show the presence or absence of an attribute is by a toggled command. In this case, the attribute has two states, and a single command allows the user to toggle between the states. For example, when rulers are showing in MacWrite, a command in the Format menu reads "Hide Rulers". If the user chooses this command, the rulers are hidden, and the command is changed to read "Show Rulers". This kind of group should be used only when the wording of the commands makes it obvious that they're opposites.
