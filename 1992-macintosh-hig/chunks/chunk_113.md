Document windows present a view into the content that people create and store. If the document is larger than the window, the window shows a portion of the document. The Window Manager provides support for the window frame. Your application determines window content and what happens in the content area. Document windows also provide a graphic representation of opening, closing, and other operations performed on documents. Windows are usually, but not necessarily, rectangles.  
This section discusses the appearance of document windows and utility windows. The section "Window Behaviors," beginning on page 139, includes information about the behavior of window components as well as information about general window behaviors.
