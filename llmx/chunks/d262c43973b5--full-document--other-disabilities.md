#### Other disabilities

People with cognitive or verbal impairments are greatly helped by clear and simple language, icons with obvious meanings, and carefully designed displays. Don't make the user's success depend on his or her ability to *remember* many different things.

Another way to make computers easier for both disabled people and others is to provide macros, making it possible to combine a number of keystrokes and mouse movements into *one* keystroke. The way macros are created and accessed must be clear and simple. It shouldn't be easy for a user to accidentally invoke a macro.

Elements of the Desktop Interface To implement the principles stated in Chapter 1, Apple has defined two classes of standard interface elements for the Apple Desktop Interface:

- Screen elements that define the "look" of the Apple Desktop Interface.
- Conventions for human-computer interactions that account for the "feel" of the interface.

The consistent "look and feel" of this interface makes users feel comfortable when they use a range of applications on Apple Computers.

Both kinds of elements are introduced briefly in this chapter. Chapter 3 provides details of their content and form.
