Under the heading "Reference Library" on that page, click Documentation to go to the main Documentation page. From there you can go to Documentation pages for various categories of information and see the lists of documents applicable to that category.  
In this document, cross-references to Apple documents look like this:  
See *Handling Carbon Windows and Controls* in Carbon User Experience Documentation.  
To navigate to that document from the main Documentation page, you click Carbon, then click User Experience on the Carbon Documentation page. You are then on the Carbon User Experience Documentation page, which lists all the documents that have information related to the user experience in Carbon.  
You can sort all the document lists by title or revision date. All documents are available in HTML, and many are also available in PDF.
