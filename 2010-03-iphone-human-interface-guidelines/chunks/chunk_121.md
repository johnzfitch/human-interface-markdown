A **detail disclosure button** reveals additional or more detailed information about something. Usually, you use detail disclosure buttons in table views, where they give users a way to see detailed information about a list item (for more information about this usage, see ["Table-View](#page-97-0) Elements" (page 98)). However, you can use this element in other types of views to provide a way to reveal more information or functionality.  
<span id="page-109-2"></span>For example, the Maps application displays a detail disclosure button users can tap to access more functionality related to the dropped pin. Figure 9-3 shows an example of a detail disclosure button.
