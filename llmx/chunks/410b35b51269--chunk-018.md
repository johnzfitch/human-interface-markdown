Most people now using computers don't have years of experience with several different computer systems. What they do have is years of direct experience with their immediate worlds. To take advantage of this prior experience, computer designers frequently use metaphors for computer processes that correspond to the everyday worlds that people are comfortable with.  
The desktop itself is the primary metaphor for the Apple Desktop Interface. It appears to be a surface on which users can keep tools and documents. Elements of this metaphor are seen plainly in the icons that represent the documents and file folders that appear on the desktop, as well as in the actions (open, close, and so on) that can be performed on those objects.  
Other metaphors are possible, within this particular interface, that can enhance ease of use, and many actions simply do not correspond to any articulated metaphor. Consider MacPaint's toolbox. You can reconcile it with the desktop by thinking of these tools as sitting on your desktop, but this isn't necessary. This alternative metaphor is successful because it makes sense for the task at hand, without fundamentally contradicting the prevailing metaphor. After all, the major principles of the desktop interface are consistency and clarity—not "desktop-ness."  
Many activities of the Apple Desktop Interface don't match any particular physical intuition or specific metaphor. For example, scroll bars clearly belong to the computer domain, bearing only a loose relationship to real scrolls. Pull—down menus aren't much like restaurant menus, except in providing a choice from alternatives. And the complete absence of a desktop in some applications is not disconcerting.
