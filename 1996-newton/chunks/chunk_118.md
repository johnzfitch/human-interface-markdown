Use icons consistently throughout your application. If there is an existing design for an icon, use it. Don't invent new designs for icons that have a standard design, such as the icons for printing, faxing, beaming, mailing, duplicating, and deleting. Figure 5-4 shows that the icon for faxing is the same in an Action picker, in the Fax routing slip, and in the Out Box.

People generally assume that different icons have different functions or behaviors, and they may try to find operational differences even if none exist. In contrast, where applications use standard icons consistently, users can quickly learn what those icons represent.
