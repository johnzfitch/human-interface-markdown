Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time. This is in contrast to the criterion for a panel, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer. (For more information about panels, see ["Panels"](#page-221-0) (page 222).)  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are modal dialogs (as described in "When to Use [Sheets"](#page-231-1) (page 232)), whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.  
<span id="page-209-1"></span>You should not use a drawer to provide users with a way to navigate hierarchically arranged content in your window. If you need to do thisin your application, you should use a source list instead. See ["Source](#page-202-0) Lists" (page 203) to learn more about source lists.
