When your app displays a window, you must decide where to put it and how big to make it. You must also respond appropriately when users move your app's windows.  
**Horizontally center new document windows and display as much of the content as possible.** The top of the document window should butt up against the menu bar (or the toolbar, if one is open and positioned below the menu bar). Subsequent windows on the same desktop should open to the right 20 points and down 20 points. Make sure that no part of a new window overlaps with the Dock (for more information about the Dock, see "The [Dock"](#page-65-0) (page 66)).  
**In general, horizontally center a new nondocument window.** The vertical position should be visually centered: The distance from the bottom of the window to the top of the Dock (if it's at the bottom of the screen) should be approximately twice the distance as that from the bottom of the menu bar to the top of the window. Subsequent windows are moved to the right 20 points and down 20 points. Make sure that no part of a new window overlaps with the Dock.

**As much as possible, reopen a window in the same location, and at the same size, that the user last specified.** Users appreciate being able to predict where a window will open. Before reopening a window, make sure that the size and state are feasible for the user's current display setup, which may have changed since the last time the window was open. If you can't reproduce both the size and location of the window, maintain the window's location, but reduce its size as necessary. If you can't reproduce either the location or the size, try to keep the window on the same display, and open the window so that as much of the content as possible is visible. If the user moves a window so that it is entirely positioned on a second display and later opens the window on a single-display system, respect the window's previous size, if possible.  
Note that if a user opens, moves, and closes a document window without making any other changes, you should save the new window position but you should not modify the file's date stamp.  
**On a multidisplay system, visually center the first new window in the screen that contains the menu bar.** If the user doesn't move that first window, display each additional window below and to the right of its predecessor. If the user moves the window, display each additional window on the screen that contains the largest portion of the frontmost window, as shown below.

In particular, you want to avoid opening a window so that it spans more than one display. The **initial position** of a window should always be contained on a single screen. If the user opensseveral windows on a multidisplay system, continue to place the windows on the screen where the user is working, each new one below and to the right of its predecessor.  
<span id="page-197-0"></span>**Don't allow users to move a window to a position from which they can'treposition it.** For example, itshould not be possible for users to "lose" a window below the Dock or on a second display that they unplug at a later time.
