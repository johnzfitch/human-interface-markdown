#### **dial** See **slider.**

**dialog box** A box that appears on the screen to solicit information from the user or to report that the computer is waiting for a process to complete. For example, a typical printing dialog box requests the user to specify such options as number of copies of a document to print. A dialog box is internally represented in a dialog record. See also **modal dialog box, modeless dialog box,** and **movable modal dialog box.**

**dimmed** Used to describe words or icons that appear in gray. For example, menu commands appear dimmed when they are unavailable; folder icons are dimmed when they are open.

**dimmed icon** An icon that represents an opened disk or folder or a disk that has been ejected.

**disabled** Describes a menu item or an item in a dialog box or alert box that cannot be chosen; the item appears dimmed.

**discontinuous selection** A selection that consists of objects that are *not* adjacent to one another.

**document** A file the user creates and can open, edit, and print. See also **file.**

**document window** The window that displays the content of a document.

**double click** (n.) Two clicks in quick succession, interpreted as a single command. The action of a double click is different from that of a single click. For example, clicking an icon selects the icon; double-clicking an icon opens it.

**double click** (v.) To press and release the mouse button twice in quick succession without moving the mouse.

**drag** To position the pointer on something, for example, a window icon, press and hold the mouse button, move the mouse, and release the mouse button.

**drag region** A region in a window frame; usually the title bar. Dragging inside this region moves the window to a new location and makes it the active window. (The window doesn't become active if the Command key is down while the window is dragged.)

**Easy Access** A feature of system software that assists people who have difficulty typing on the keyboard or manipulating the mouse. See also **Mouse Keys, Slow Keys, Sticky Keys.**

**edit** To change or modify. For example, to insert, remove, replace, or move text in a document.

**Edit menu** A menu that contains editing commands such as Copy, Cut, and Paste.

**Enter key** A key that notifies the application that the user is through entering information in a particular area of the document, such as a field in a database record. The user can also press the Enter key (like the Return key) to dismiss dialog boxes and alert boxes.

**ergonomics** The science of designing work environments that allow people and products to interact efficiently and safely. Examples include screen ergonomics and workplace ergonomics. Sometimes called *human engineering.*

**Escape key** A key that allows the user to quickly get out of a situation while working on a computer. In many applications, pressing the Escape key allows the user to stop an operation in progress. The user can also press the Escape key as an alternate to clicking the Cancel button in a dialog box.

**event-driven** Describes a kind of program that responds to user input in real time by repeatedly testing for events posted by interrupt routines. An event-driven program does nothing until it detects an event such as a click of the mouse button.

**extension** A software program that adds some feature to the operating system.

**field** A data item separated from other data by blanks, tabs, or other specific delimiters. A particular type or category of information in a database.

**file** Any named, ordered collection of information stored on a disk. Application programs and operating systems on disks are files as well as documents that users create. A Macintosh file consists of a data fork and a resource fork. See also document.

**File menu** A menu that contains commands that affect whole documents such as Open, Save, Print, and Quit.

**file server** A combination of controller software and a mass-storage device that allows computer users to share common files and applications through a network. A file server on an AppleTalk network system typically consists of a Macintosh computer with AppleShare software and one or more hard disks.

**Finder** The application that maintains the Macintosh desktop and starts up other programs at the request of the user. The user uses the Finder to manage documents and applications, and to get information to and from disks.

**fixed-point method** A method for extending a continuous selection of text, using Shift-click, which extends the selection on *either* side (but not both) of a fixed point. Compare **additive method.**

**Font menu** A menu that contains text fonts, such as Geneva and Chicago, available on a system (residing in a user's System Folder). See also **font.**

**font size** The size of a font of characters in points; equivalent to the distance between the ascent line and the descent line of one line of text. Examples of font size are 12 point and 18 point.

**font style** A set of stylistic variations other than size, such as italic, bold, and underline.

**Forward Delete key** A key on the Apple Extended Keyboard that causes the character to the right of the insertion point to be deleted in left-to-right systems. The insertion point does not move: the characters to its right are "vacuumed" in toward it as each is deleted. Compare **Delete key.**

**graphics** Information presented in the form of pictures or images. Compare **text.**

**grow region** A window region, usually within the content region, where dragging changes the size of an active window.

**input** Information transferred into a computer from some external source, such as the keyboard, a disk drive, or a modem. Compare **output.**
