A **window** provides a frame for viewing and interacting with apps and data.  
Although users tend to view most rectangular areas on the screen as "windows," developers need to know about the main varieties of windows in OS X.  
- A **document window** contains file-based user data.
- An **app window** is the main window of an app that is not document-based.
- A **panel** floats above other windows and provides tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. In some cases, a panel can be transparent. (For more information about panels, see ["Panels"](#page-208-0) (page 209).)
- A **dialog** appears in response to a user action and typically provides ways users can complete the action. A dialog requires a response from the user before it can close. (For more information about dialogs, see ["Dialogs"](#page-214-0) (page 215).)
- An **alert** is a special type of dialog that appears when a serious problem occurs, such as an error. Because an alert is a dialog, it also requires a user response before it can close. (For more information about alerts, see ["Alerts"](#page-235-0) (page 236).)  
Examples of these window types are shown here.

As you can see in the window examples above, the overall appearance of windows on OS X is subtle and understated. This muted appearance helps users focus on the content that's important to them.  
**Note:** A popover is not a window per se, but users might think of it as one (especially if they can detach it from its parent UI element or area). To learn more about how to use popovers in your app, see ["Popovers"](#page-204-0) (page 205).
