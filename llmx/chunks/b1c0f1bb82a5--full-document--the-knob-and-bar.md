#### **The Knob and Bar**

The bar of a scroller represents the entire scrollable area. The knob represents the part of the area that's visible. The placement of the knob in the bar shows which part is currently visible in the opening. On a vertical scroIler, the height of the knob relative to the height of the bar indicates how much of the material, from top to bottom, is visible. On a horizontal scroIler, the width of the knob indicates how much of the material is visible from side to side. The knob shrinks as the user adds to the material, and grows as material is deleted. However, the knob never shrinks to be smaller than a square.

Users scroll the display by moving the knob in the bar. The knob can be moved in four ways:

- By dragging it to a new location. The display is adjusted as the knob moves.
- By clicking in the bar (outside the knob). The knob jumps to the location of the click, and the display is adjusted accordingly. If the user doesn't immediately release the mouse button after pressing it, the knob can be dragged to a new location .. This permits users, in a single mouse action, to select the general part of a document they want to view (by clicking in the bar) and then to adjust the display (by dragging the knob).

- By clicking or pressing the scroll buttons. The arrows on the scroll buttons point in the direction the knob will move.
- By extending a selection outside the opening where it's displayed. This automatically scrolls unseen portions of the selection into view.
