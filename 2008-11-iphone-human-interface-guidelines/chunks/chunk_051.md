A **web view** is a region that can display rich, HTML content in your application screen. For example, Mail uses a web view to display message content, because it can contain elements in addition to plain text (Figure 8-11 shows an example of this).

In addition to displaying web content, a web view provides elements that support navigation through open webpages. Although you can choose to provide webpage navigation functionality, it's best to avoid creating an application that looks and behaves like a mini web browser.  
If you have a webpage or web application, you might choose to use a web view to implement a simple iPhone application that provides a wrapper for it. If you plan to access web content that you control, be sure to read *Safari Web Content Guide for iPhone OS* to learn how to create web content that is compatible with and optimized for display on iPhone OS–based devices.
