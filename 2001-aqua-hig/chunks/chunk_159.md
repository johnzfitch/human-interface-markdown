- **New keyboard equivalents:** Command-H is reserved as an equivalent to the "Hide <Application Name>" menu command that appears in the application menu of all applications. Command-M is reserved as an equivalent to the Minimize menu command in the Window menu. It applies to any active window that can be minimized. The command initiated in Mac OS 9 by Command-M, Make Alias, now has the keyboard equivalent Command-L. For more information, see ["Keyboard Equivalents" \(page 172\)](#page-171-1).
