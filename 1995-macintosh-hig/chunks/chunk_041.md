It's essential to store region-dependent information in resources so that text the user sees can be translated during localization without modification of your application's code. When you create resources, consider text size, location, and direction. Text size varies in different languages. Also, depending on the script system, the direction of text may change. Most Middle Eastern languages read from right to left. Text location within a window should be easy to change.
