- **Size of button:** 20 x 20 pixels minimum
- **Size of icon:** 32 x 32 pixels recommended, with at least 5 pixels between icon and button edge
- **Spacing:** Leave at least 8 pixels between buttons with rounded corners, stacked vertically or aligned horizontally.
- **Text:** Label font (10-point Lucida Grande Regular)  
If a bevel button has an icon and a label, you can put the text anywhere in relation to the icon. Carbon and Cocoa developers can specify the location in Interface Builder.  
In some situations—providing text-alignment options, for example—it is appropriate to use bevel buttons to graphically represent several mutually exclusive choices. You can also use bevel buttons for nonstandard-size push buttons.
