Each application and document window exists in its own layer, so documents from different applications can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the window was last accessed. When a user clicks an inactive document or chooses it from the Window menu, only that document, and any open utilitywindows, should be brought to the front. Users can bringallwindows of an application forward by clicking its icon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the application's Window menu. These actions should bringforward all of the application's openwindows, maintainingtheir onscreen location, size, and layering order within the application. For more information, see "The [Window](#page-161-1) [Menu"](#page-161-1) (page 162).  
<span id="page-187-4"></span><span id="page-187-2"></span>Utilitywindows are always in the same layer, the top layer. Theyare visible onlywhen their application is active and they float on top of any document windows in the application.  
Users can cycle forward or backward through all open document windows by using Command-` (grave accent) and Command-Shift-` (grave accent). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.
