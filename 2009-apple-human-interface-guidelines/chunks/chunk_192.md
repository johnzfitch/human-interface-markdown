The **application menu** contains items that apply to the application as a whole rather than to a specific document or other window.

#### <span id="page-177-1"></span>The Application Menu Title  
To help users identify the active application, the application menu title is in boldface.  
In order to fit within the allotted menu bar space, the application menu title should be one word, if possible, and a maximum of 16 characters. Don't include the application version number in the name; version information belongs in the About window. If the application name is too long, provide a short name (16 characters or fewer) as part of the application package. The Hide, Quit, and About items should also use the short application name. If you don't provide a short name, the application name is truncated from the end (and an ellipsis is added), if necessary.  
#### <span id="page-177-2"></span>The Application Menu Contents  
<span id="page-177-5"></span>**About** *ApplicationName***.** Opens your application's About window, which contains copyright information and version number. (For more information,see "About [Windows"](#page-233-1) (page 234). If you've specified a short name (see "The [Application](#page-177-1) Menu Title" (page 178)), use it in the About menu item; use the full application name in the About window.  
**Preferences…(Command-,).**Opens a preference window for your application. See *MultipleUser Environments* for more information on handling preferences in a multiple-user environment.  
<span id="page-177-6"></span>In the application menu, put all commands that provide access to your application's preference dialogs first, followed by application-specific items. Put a menu separator between the About command and the Preferences command. If your application provides document-specific preferences, make them available in the File menu (see "The File [Menu"](#page-178-0) (page 179)). Most document-specific preferences should have a unique name, such as Page Setup, rather than Preferences.  
<span id="page-177-4"></span><span id="page-177-3"></span>**Services.** The Services submenu provides a way for one application to offer its capabilities to another application. See ["Services"](#page-76-0) (page 77) for more information on providing and using services.  
<span id="page-177-7"></span>**Hide** *ApplicationName* **(Command-H).** Hides all of the windows of the currently running application and brings the most recently used application to the foreground. If necessary, use the short application title (see "The [Application](#page-177-1) Menu Title" (page 178)).  
**Hide Others (Command-Option-H).** Hides the windows of all the other applications currently running.  
**Show All.** Shows all windows of all currently running applications.  
<span id="page-178-4"></span>**Quit** *ApplicationName* **(Command-Q).** This last item in the application menu should be preceded by a separator. When a user chooses Quit and there are unsaved documents, present the necessary alerts (see "Dialogs for Saving, Closing, and [Quitting"](#page-245-0) (page 246)). If necessary, use the short application name (see ["The](#page-177-1) [Application](#page-177-1) Menu Title" (page 178)).  
<span id="page-178-2"></span>You may include other application-specific menu items between the Preferences and Services menu items. Don't include a Help menu item however, because this belongsin the Help menu (see "The Help [Menu"](#page-186-0) (page 187)).
