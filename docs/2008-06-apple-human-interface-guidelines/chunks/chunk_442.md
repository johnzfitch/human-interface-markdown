A **column view** provides a way for users to view and select items from an organized hierarchy of data. When users click an object in one column, its contents (its descendants in the hierarchy) are revealed in a column to the right. Each column displays only those objectsthat are descendants of the item selected in the previous column. If the item selected in the previous column has no descendants, the column to the right might display details about the item.  
Columns in a column view are usually resizable. In addition, a column view includes a vertical scroll bar between each pair of columns and a horizontal scroll bar along the bottom of all columns. A good example of a column view is the column-view mode of the Finder, shown in Figure 15-81.
