<span id="page-60-1"></span>People use **scroll bars** to view areas of a document or a list that is larger than can fit in the current window. Only the active window can be scrolled. A window can have a horizontal scroll bar, a vertical scroll bar, or both, or neither.

The **scroller** size reflects how much of the document is visible; the smaller the scroller, the less of the content the user can see at that time. The scroller represents the relative location, in the whole document, of the portion that can be seen in the window.  
If the entire contents of a document is visible in a window, the scroll bars do not contain scrollers. Scroll bars in inactive windows have an inactive appearance. See [Figure 5-5 \(page 59\).](#page-58-2)  
The user can use scroll bars by doing the following:  
- Dragging the scroller: This method is usually the fastest way to move around a document. In Mac OS X, the window's contents changes in "real time" as the user drags the scroller.
- Clicking a scroll arrow: This means, "Show me more of the document that's hidden in this direction." The scroller moves in the direction of the arrow. Each scroll arrow click moves the content one unit; your application determines what one unit equals. For example, a word processor would move a line of text per click, a spreadsheet could move one row or column. To ensure smooth scrolling effects, specify units of the same size throughout a document.  
■ Clicking or pressing in the scroll track: Clicking advances the document by a windowful—the height or width of the window, minus at least one unit of overlap to maintain the user's context. This unit of overlap should be the same as one scroll arrow unit. The Page Up and Page Down keys also move the document view by a windowful.  
Pressing in the scroll track displays consecutive windowfuls of the document, until the location of the indicator catches up to the location of the pointer (or until the user releases the mouse button).  
**Note:** The user can change scroll bar behavior in General preferences so that clicking or pressing in the scroll track scrolls to the pointer location.  
It's best not to add controls to scroll bars. If you add more than one control to this area, it's hard for people to distinguish among controls and click the right one. Acceptable additions to the scroll bar include a splitter bar and a status bar. To ensure that window controls are easy to use and understand, it's best to place the majority of your features in the menus as commands. If you really want to provide additional access to features, consider creating a utility window such as a palette with buttons.  
<span id="page-62-3"></span><span id="page-62-2"></span>Make sure you don't use a scroll bar when you should really use a slider. Use sliders to change settings; use scroll bars only for representing the relative position of the visible portion of a document and in scrolling lists.
