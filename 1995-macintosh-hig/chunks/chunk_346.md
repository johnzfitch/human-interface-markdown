- Are the Apple, File, and Edit menus present, with at least the standard items? (These menus are needed for desk accessories, even when the application doesn't use them.)
- Has enough room been left on the right side of the menu bar for the menu that some desk accessories add to the menu bar? Is there also enough extra room to allow for the expansion that almost always occurs during translation into other languages?
- Do the unique menus of the application have names that are appropriate? Are the names sufficiently different from the standard menu names? Can the user understand and remember their meaning?
- Are frequently used menu items available at the top level rather than in a submenu or a dialog box? If not, can the user move them up?
- When an item in a menu is currently disabled, is it dimmed in the menu rather than missing from it?
- If all the items in a menu are currently disabled, is the menu title dimmed? Can the user still pull down the menu and see the dimmed names of the operations?
- Are toggled menu items either unambiguously a verb or unambiguously a state of being?
- Are menu titles and items in caps/lowercase unless there is a compelling reason to have a different style, such as ALL CAPS in a Style menu?
- Do menu items have an ellipsis character (…) if more information is required from the user before completing the command?
- Do menu items blink briefly, and is the menu title highlighted until the command is complete?
- Are the dotted lines in menus (as well as dimmed items) unselectable? These items should not be highlighted when the user moves the mouse pointer over them.
- Are the menu items truly menu items? Menu items should not be used as text, section titles, or status indicators.
- In a hierarchical menu, does the title of the submenu have a right-pointing triangle? Are submenus used only for lists of related items?  
**358** Menus  
- <span id="page-382-0"></span>■ Can the user see all the commands, items, and submenu titles in a menu without scrolling? Scrolling should be necessary only for menus that users have added to or for menus that spill over because the user has selected a large system font.
- Does the application support Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste?
- If the application is text oriented, can the user change the font and style by using menu commands?
