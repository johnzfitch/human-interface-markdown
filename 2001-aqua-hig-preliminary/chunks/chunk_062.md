A drawer is a "child" window that slides out from a parent window, and which the user can open or close (show or hide). A drawer contains controls that are tightly linked to the controls in its parent window.

#### <span id="page-65-0"></span>When to Use Drawers  
Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time. (Contrast this criterion with a palette, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer.) Some examples of uses of drawers include access to favorites lists, access to the Mailboxes drawer in the Mail application, or access to favorites or bookmarks in a browser.  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are primarily intended to replace modal dialogs, as described in ["When to Use Sheets" \(page 74\)](#page-73-0).  
#### <span id="page-65-1"></span>Drawer Behavior  
The user shows or hides a drawer, typically by pressing a button or choosing a command. If a drawer contains a valid drop target, you may also wish to have the drawer open when the user drags an appropriate object to where the drawer appears.  
When a drawer opens or closes, it appears to be sliding from behind its parent window, to the left or right side. You should ensure that a parent window's default position allows its drawer to open fully without disappearing offscreen.  
To support the illusion that a closed drawer is hidden behind its parent window, an open drawer should be smaller than its parent window. When the parent window is resized vertically, an open drawer resizes if necessary to ensure that it does not exceed the height of the parent window. (A drawer can be shorter than its parent window.) The illusion is further reinforced by the fact that the inner border of a drawer is hidden by the parent window and that the parent window's shadow is seen on the drawer when appropriate.  
The user can resize an open drawer by dragging its outside border. The degree to which a drawer can be resized is determined by the content of the drawer. If the user resizes a drawer to the point where content is significantly obscured, the drawer should simply close. For example, if a drawer contains a scrolling list, the user should be able to resize the drawer to cover up the edge of the list. But if the user makes the drawer so small that the items in the list are difficult to identify, the drawer should close. If the user sets a new size (that is allowable) for a drawer, the new size is used the next time the drawer is opened.  
#### <span id="page-66-3"></span><span id="page-66-0"></span>Using Controls in a Drawer  
A drawer can contain any control that is appropriate to its intended use. Follow normal layout guidelines, as stated in ["Positioning Controls in Dialogs" \(page 114\)](#page-113-0). To ensure that the parent window's shadow does not affect any controls in the drawer, leave a border around the controls as shown in [Figure 5-8.](#page-64-4)  
<span id="page-66-4"></span>Consider a drawer part of the parent window; don't dim a drawer's controls when the parent window has focus, and vice versa.
