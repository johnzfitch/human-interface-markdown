#### Scrolling menus

If a menu becomes too long to fit on the screen, an indicator appears at the bottom of the menu to show that there are more items (Figure 3-24). When the user drags over the indicator, the menu scrolls to show the additional items. When the last item is shown, the indicator disappears.

As soon as the menu starts scrolling, another indicator appears at the top of the menu to show that some items are now hidden in that direction (Figure 3-25).

If the user drags back up to the top, the menu scrolls back down in the same manner. If the user lets go of the mouse button or selects another menu, and then selects the original menu again, it appears in its original position, with the hidden items and the indicator at the bottom.
