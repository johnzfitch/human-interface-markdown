#### Option

The Option key, when used together with other keys, produces <sup>a</sup> set of international characters and special symbols. For example, in many Macintosh fonts, Option-4 produces the <t symbol, Option-r produces ®, and Option-g produces ©. Shift and Option can be used together, in combination with a character key, to produce yet other symbols—for example, Option-Shift-? to produce the Spanish ,; character. The Key Caps desk accessory lets the user preview these combinations in all available fonts. The Option key can also be used in conjunction with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag.
