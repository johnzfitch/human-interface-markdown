Query documents are documents that contain instructions used to get data out of or into a database. The query document icon uses the outline of a document page with a database element attached to its lower right. Figure 8-38 shows the default icons that appear in the Finder if you don't supply a custom icon.

You can customize a query document icon by adding graphics to the document page. Be sure to maintain the outline of the icon and the volume symbol that represents the database. See *Inside Macintosh: Interapplication Communication* for information on using the Data Access Manager.
