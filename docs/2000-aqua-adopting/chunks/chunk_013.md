This section describes how to design alerts for Mac OS X. [Figure 1-4](#page-10-0) shows an example of a standard alert and describes its dimensions.

Alert guidelines in Mac OS X are similar to those published in *Mac OS 8 Human Interface Guidelines* with several notable exceptions.  
Designing Alerts **11**  
■ The icon in a Mac OS X alert should be that of the application displaying the alert. The new window layering model described in ["Window Layering"](#page-2-0)  [\(page 3\)](#page-2-0) makes this change important. Without an identifying icon, it may not be obvious to the user which application is displaying the alert. One exception to this guideline: If there is a critical need to warn the user of a potentially data-damaging operation, you may wish to use the caution icon, as shown in [Figure 1-5.](#page-11-0)

- Button names in alerts should correspond to the action the user performs when pressing the button—for example, Erase, Save, or Delete.
- We strongly encourage the inclusion of informative text in Mac OS X alerts, in addition to the standard message text. This text, which appears in the Small System Font, provides a fuller description of the situation and its consequences. Providing a warning that an action cannot be undone, for example, is an appropriate use of informative text.
