Mail is one of the most highly visible, well-used, and appreciated applications in Mac OS X. It is also a very powerful program, one that allows users to create, receive, prioritize, and store email, track action items and events, and create notes and invitations. Mail provides most of thisfunctionality in a single multipane window. Thisis convenient for people using a desktop computer, because they can leave a Mail window on the display screen (or minimized to the Dock) all the time and switch to it whenever they choose. Figure 1-6 illustrates many of the features available in the Mail message-viewing and compose windows on the desktop.

But when people are mobile, their needs for an email application are simpler, and they want access to core functionality quickly. For thisreason, Mail on iPhone OS–based devicesfocuses on the most important things people do with their email: receive, create, send, and organize messages. To do this, it displays a pared-down user interface that makes the organization of the user's accounts and mailboxes clear and centers the user's attention on the messages.  
Mail in iPhone OS is a perfect example of a productivity style application: To ease navigation through the content, Mail in iPhone OS takes advantage of the naturally hierarchical organization of people's email and displays on successive pages accounts, mailboxes, message lists, and individual messages. Users drill down from the general (the list of accounts) to the specific (a message) by selecting an item in a list and viewing the things associated with that item. To learn more about the productivity style of iPhone applications, see "Productivity [Applications"](#page-18-0) (page 19).  
In addition, Mail in iPhone OS enables actions, such as create and send, by displaying a handful of familiar controls that are easy to tap. Figure 1-7 shows how Mail makes it simple to view and send email in iPhone OS. Note how elements at the top of each screen make it easy for users to know both their current and previous location in the application.
