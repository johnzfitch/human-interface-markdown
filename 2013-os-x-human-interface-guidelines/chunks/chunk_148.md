Text is prevalent throughout the OS X interface forsuch things as button names, menu labels, dialog messages, and help tags. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of UI design.  
In the same way that it is best to work with a professional graphical designer on the icons and images in your app, it's best to work with a professional writer on your app's user-visible text. A skilled writer can help you develop a style of expression that reflects your app's design, and can apply that style consistently throughout your app.  
For guidance on Apple-specific terminology, the writer should refer to the *Apple Style Guide* . That document covers style and usage issues, and is the key reference for how Apple uses language.  
For issues that aren't covered in the *Apple Publications Style Guide* , Apple recommends three other works: *The American Heritage Dictionary* , *The Chicago Manual of Style* , and *Words Into Type* . When these books give conflicting rules, *The Chicago Manual of Style* takes precedence for questions of usage and *The American Heritage Dictionary* for questions of spelling.
