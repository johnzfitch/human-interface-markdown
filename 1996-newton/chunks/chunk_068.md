In addition to scrolling, an application that deals with multiple instances of similar information can show an overview of the information—a view of the forest instead of the trees. From the overview a user can select a part of the information to see in detail. [Figure 2-37](#page-88-0) shows a conceptual view of the Notepad's overview.  
#### Overview Contents 2  
An overview is not another view displayed on top of the current view; an overview is the same view in a different format. Instead of showing individual data items in full detail, an overview presents a summary list of multiple data items.  
**Figure 2-37** How an overview relates to a detail view  
<span id="page-88-0"></span>![](images/_page_88_Figure_3.jpeg)  
An overview commonly takes the form of a table of contents. It lists the titles or names of items that can be viewed in more detail. Together with the name or title of each item, the overview lists a a key bit of information about the item. For instance, the Notepad lists the first part of each note next to its title. The Names File lists a phone number with each name. The Call Log lists the date and time of each call. And the Extras Drawer lists each item's size and where it is stored.  
If an item's title or supplemental information is too long for the space available in an overview, the application can use an ellipsis to indicate there is more information.  
Next to each item in an overview there may be a small icon that symbolizes the type of item—note, checklist, or outline in the Notepad; person, company, group, or place in the Names File; and so forth. The overview may also have a checkbox next to each item so a user can select one or more items and act

<span id="page-89-0"></span>on the selected items with controls in the status bar, such as a Filing button or Action button (see ["Primary Controls and Status Bar" on page 2-11](#page-54-0)). A gray line separates checkboxes from data items.  
If an overview lists items that users may have filed in folders, the overview should have a folder tab at the top so users can determine which folder's items are displayed (see ["Folder Tab" on page 8-19\)](#page-260-0). If listed items cannot be filed in folders, the application can organize the overview by some other criterion, such as by date. For example, the Date Book groups meetings and events by date, starting with the displayed date.  
#### Overview Button 2  
The control for seeing an overview is the round black button located between the universal scroll arrows. On an Apple MessagePad the Overview button is at the center of the screen below the display area. Figure 2-38 shows the Overview button.

Like the universal scroll arrows, the Overview button is a function of the Newton system and is not attached to one view. The Overview button affects one open view. To be affected a view must be set up during application development to receive taps on the Overview button. In addition, the view must be in front of all other open views that have also been set up to receive those taps. The view that is affected by the Overview button may be partially or completely covered by other open views that were not set up to receive Overview-button taps. (A view that receives taps on the Overview button also receives taps on the universal scroll arrows, which are described in ["Universal Scroll Arrows" on page 2-38](#page-81-0)).  
#### <span id="page-90-0"></span>Switching to and from an Overview 2  
To see an overview, a user taps the Newton device's Overview button. The detail item that was displayed should either be centered in the overview or at the top of the overview. Figure 2-39 shows the change when a Names File user taps the Overview button.

To see an item in detail, a user taps its title in the overview. Tapping an item listed in the overview closes the overview and displays the detail view for the item that was tapped. Your application could also take different actions depending on where the user taps an entry in the overview. For example, in a Names File overview, tapping the left part of a line, where the name is

<span id="page-91-0"></span>displayed, causes the normal view of the tapped name to appear; but tapping the right part of the line, where the telephone number is displayed, initiates a phone call.  
If an application spends more than a few seconds preparing an overview, it should display a status slip with a message such as "Preparing overview..." (see ["Status Slips" on page 2-20\)](#page-63-0).  
#### Scroll and Overview in an Overview 2  
An overview should respond to the universal scroll arrows and the Overview button. When a user taps a scroll arrow, your application should scroll all the currently visible items out of view except the last item. After scrolling, there should always be one item still visible from before scrolling. When scrolling the last item into view, the application can leave more than one item still visible from before scrolling so that the overview remains full of items; users can't do anything with empty space in an overview.  
When a user taps the Overview button, the overview goes away and the detail view reappears, showing the same item as before the overview appeared. Thus, repeatedly tapping the Overview button switches back and forth between the overview and the detail view. Avoid any temptation to use the Overview button to zoom up or down multiple levels of detail or to step through a hierarchy of views, because the user can easily become confused about whether the next tap will go up or down.  
An application that doesn't have a list-style overview can use the Overview button to toggle a view between two levels of detail or magnification. If there are more than two levels of zooming, the Overview button must always toggle between the same two levels, preferably the biggest and smallest levels. For access to other levels, use another type of control described in [Chapter 3, "Controls."](#page-94-0) For example, you could use a button on the status bar—the Show button or a special Zoom button or zoom-looking picture button. For completeness, the magnification control should provide access to all levels, including the two levels controlled by the Overview button.  
#### <span id="page-92-0"></span>Closing an Overview 2  
Tapping the Close box has the same effect whether a view is displaying item detail or an overview—the application closes. Tapping a Close box in an overview does not switch to item detail.
