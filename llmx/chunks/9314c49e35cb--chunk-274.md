Carroll, John M., ed. *Designing Interaction: Psychology at the Human-Computer Interface.* Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1991.  
This book consists of articles by a number of leading HCI researchers and practitioners. It focuses on trying to bridge the gap between psychological theory and HCI design practice. Other themes in the book include close examinations of the design process and discussions of what can be learned from looking at real-world artifacts and situations. This collection will be of particular interest to those people with an interest in the theoretical and conceptual foundations of HCI design.  
Greenbaum, Joan, and Morten Kyng, eds. *Design at Work: Cooperative Design of Computer Systems.* Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1991.  
An excellent collection that strikes a nice balance between practice and theory. In general, the articles reflect what has been called the Scandinavian approach, emphasizing participatory design and trying to ensure that computer systems enhance human work rather than mechanize it. Although the articles draw on concepts from anthropology, sociology, and linguistics, the book's strength is in its many examples and its practical orientation.

Winograd, Terry, and Fernando Flores. *Understanding Computers and Cognition: A New Foundation for Design.* Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1987.  
This book lays a foundation for interface design by grounding it in human behavior, language, and the social and cultural contexts within which they occur. The book provides a perspective on human-computer interface design very different from the more traditional approach described by Card, Moran, and Newell's GOMS (goals, operators, methods, and selectors) model.
