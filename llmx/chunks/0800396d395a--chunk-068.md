Modified by the Shift key, the left arrow key positions the insertion point to the left of the current selection at the beginning of a word. The right arrow key positions it to the right of the current selection at the end of a word. Thus both keys move the insertion point from word to word.  
The up arrow key puts the insertion point at the beginning of the word one line directly above the beginning of the current selection. The down arrow key puts it at the end of the word one line directly below the end of the current selection. As the up and down arrow keys move the insertion point from line to line; they choose words that lie directly above or below the original starting point. (In other words, the location of the insertion point can be calculated by the same rules that determine the edge of the selection when the user double-clicks and drags directly upward or directly downward.)
