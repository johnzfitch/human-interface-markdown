People are extremely complex and varied. A theory of human existence that would provide a framework for the design of human—computer interaction seems a long way off. It would be oversimplified anyway, because computers themselves change the way people think, feel, and behave. Computer design and human activity will therefore evolve together. But if computer designers avoid making sound models for human—computer interaction, there can be no evolution in the field. If a designer is to provide a consistent world that a person can enter with ease and effectiveness, it is important to have a specific model of how people behave.  
The Apple Desktop Interface represents the result of a great deal of concern with the human part of human—computer interaction. It has been designed explicitly to enhance the effectiveness of people. This approach has frequently been labeled "user friendly," though "user reasonable" is probably more appropriate. It has been thought of as the ideal interface for beginners, though it would be more useful to think of it as good for people in general. It has been labeled "simple," though "direct" and "effective" make more sense. And it has been described as "easy to learn," though "accessible by humans" would be as true.  
The following sections discuss the differences between these contrasting descriptions, and describe the Apple Desktop Interface in the context of the model of human—computer interaction that it assumes.  
#### **Human Tasks**  
Not very long ago, most personal computer users were also programmers. In fact, many of them were computer builders as well, because personal computers were available only as kits. Today, most personal computers are seen as *tools* that magnify a person's ability to perform all kinds of tasks that formerly were done without computers. The Apple Desktop Interface provides an environment in which people can perform their many tasks in a consistent and familiar computer environment—one that supports these human tasks. *Tasks* are critical. Ideally, the computer supports the performance of tasks without being a separate focus for the user's attention.  
The desktop interface is optimized for non-programmers, for people involved in tasks other than strictly computer tasks, but it is not *just* for them. In fact, much of the early development of computer interfaces was aimed at enhancing the programmer's working environment (it was once thought that *everyone* should program). But even programmers often have non-programming tasks, and the interface also serves them well. It is a *human* interface, for non-computer human tasks.  
#### Active Users  
Unless people are actively involved in what they are doing, they don't remember what they've done and don't learn much from the experience. Computer interactions require that users participate in the exchange with the computer. It is unfortunate when users react in a non-planned way to the computer's actions. The Apple Desktop Interface is designed explicitly to maximize the individual's involvement in computer activities. Most of the time, users have a wide range (not simply a constrained set) of possible activities from which they choose.  
Users can customize the interface to their tastes and tasks. Consider the Control Panel, which allows them to choose (or create) background desktop patterns, set the sound volume, and so on. User can arrange icons on the desktop in whatever way helps them categorize and find things. And they can choose from several ways to view files and documents. All this relieves the computer designer from having to create a system that matches every person. Instead, the designer creates a general model that individual users can tailor to their individual needs.
