This document describes what you need to do in order to design your application for the Mac OS X user interface (known as Aqua). This document is primarily intended for Carbon and Cocoa developers who want their application to look right and behave correctly for Mac OS X. This document assumes the reader is familiar with *Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines*, which can be found at <http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macos8/HumanInterfaceToolbox/ HumanInterfaceGuide/humaninterfaceguide.html>  
**Note:** This document applies as of Mac OS X Public Beta Release. Note that control sizes are compatible with platinum appearance metrics, but that layout guidelines for Mac OS X differ somewhat from Mac OS 8 and 9. Carbon developers, in particular, should review the material in ["Control Layout](#page-25-0)  [Guidelines" \(page 26\)](#page-25-0),["Menu Layout" \(page 33\),](#page-32-0) and ["Using the Appearance](#page-41-0)  [Manager" \(page 42\)](#page-41-0). Apple reserves the right to make changes in future releases.
