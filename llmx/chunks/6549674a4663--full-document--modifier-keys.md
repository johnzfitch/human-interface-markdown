# Modifier keys

Modifier keys are those that alter the way other keystrokes are interpreted. They are the Shift, Option, Caps Lock, Control, and Apple (or Command) keys. Not all Apple keyboards contain all of these keys. These keys sometimes affect the way the mouse button is interpreted as well. It is important that you use these keys consistently from program to program, as outlined in these guidelines.
