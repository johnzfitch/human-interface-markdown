# COMMANDS

Once the information to be operated on has been selected, a command to operate on that information can be chosen from lists of commands called menus.

The Apple II's pull-down menus have the advantage that they're not visible until the user wants to see them; at the same time they're easy for the user to see and choose items from.

Most commands either do something, in which case they're verbs or verb phrases, or else they specify an attribute of an object, in which case they're adjectives. They usually apply to the current selection, although some commands apply to the whole document or window.

When you're designing your application, don't assume that everything has to be done through menu commands. Sometimes it's more appropriate for an operation to take place as a result of direct user manipulation of a graphic object on the screen, such as a control or icon. Alternatively, a single command can execute complicated instructions if it brings up a dialog box for the user to fill in.
