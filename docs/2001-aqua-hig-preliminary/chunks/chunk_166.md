<span id="page-181-2"></span>A good alert message states clearly what caused the alert to appear and what the user can do about it. Express everything in the user's vocabulary. Here's an example of an alert message that provides little useful information:

You could improve this message by describing the problem in the user's vocabulary:

To really make the alert useful, provide a suggestion about what the user can do to get out of the current situation:

Consider the questions in the checklist as you review your software. Answering every question with a "yes" will ensure that your product conforms to the Aqua human interface guidelines. Even if you can't answer "yes" to every question, this checklist can help your product maintain the spirit of the guidelines and principles.  
Although business realities (such as product schedules) often force you to make design tradeoffs, remember that, for many users and product reviewers, the extent to which you adopt Aqua is the most visible means of measuring how "Mac-like" your product is.
