A preferences window is a modeless dialog that contains settings that the user changes infrequently. If you have several different groups of preferences, consider using a toolbar within the preferences window in which each item in the toolbar changes the content of the main window. For examples, note how some of the applications provided with Mac OS X—such as the Finder, Safari, or Mail—implement preferences windows.

Avoid including a resize control or a zoom button. The preferences window should not be a utility window and it should be modeless.  
If you have changeable panes in your preferences window, be sure to remember which pane the user selected the last time the window was open.
