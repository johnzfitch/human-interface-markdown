As stated already, double clicking involves a second click that follows immediately after the end of a first click. If the two clicks are close enough to one another in terms of time (as set by the user in the Control Panel) and of screen location, then they constitute a double click. Its most common use is as a shortcut way (but *never* the only way) to perform an action. For example, clicking twice on an icon is a faster way to open it than selecting it and choosing Open; clicking twice on a word to select it is faster than dragging through it.  
Some applications support selection by double clicking and triple clicking. As always with multiple clicks, the second click extends the effect of the first click, and the third click extends the effect of the second click. For example, in a text-oriented application, the first click selects an insertion point, the second click might select the whole word containing the insertion point, and the third click might select the whole sentence. In a graphics application, the first click might select a single object, and double and triple clicks might select successively larger sets of objects.  
Three clicks is probably the practical limit, and even that is difficult for many people. If an application defines the effect only of single and double clicking, a third click should have no effect. If triple clicking is defined, then the fourth click should have no effect.  
Double clicking is a shortcut for those users physically able to use it. For example, users with a little experience like to be able to launch an application by double clicking on its icon rather than clicking on it to select it and then selecting Open from the File menu. Again, double clicking should never be the *only* way to accomplish a task. Many novice users, children, and disabled people have a hard time double clicking.  
To allow the software to distinguish efficiently between single clicks and double clicks on objects that respond to both, an operation invoked by double clicking an object must be an enhancement, superset, or extension of the feature invoked by single clicking that object. Triple clicking is also possible; it should similarly represent an extension of a double click.  
#### Insertion Points and Pointers  
Each pointer has a **hot spot**, the portion of the pointer that must be positioned over a screen object before mouse clicks can have an effect on that object. The hot spot should be intuitive, such as the tip of an arrow pointer or the center point of a crosshair pointer. Mouse clicks have effect only when the pointer's hot spot is positioned over the target object's **hot zone**.  
Don't confuse the user by changing the pointer's shape without a reason. You might want to have the pointer change shape to give feedback on the range of activities that make sense either in a particular area of the screen or in a current mode. Sometimes, the result of mouse actions depends on the item under the pointer when the mouse button is pressed. Where an application uses modes for different functions, the pointer can be a different shape in each mode. For example, in MacPaint, the pointer shape always reflects the currently selected tool.  
Figure 3 shows some examples of pointers and their effect. An application can use additional pointers as needed for other contexts.

During a particularly lengthy operation, when the user can do nothing but wait until the operation is completed, the pointer may change its shape and become a status or progress indicator. This indicator lets the user know that the system hasn't died—it's just busy. The standard pointer used for this purpose is a wristwatch. During even longer operations, the beachball pointer spins to provide positive feedback that all is well.
