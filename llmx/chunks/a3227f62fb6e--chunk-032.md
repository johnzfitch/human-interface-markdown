BACKSPACE is not a character, but an editing command executed whenever a certain key is pressed. If the selection contains characters, BACKSPACE does nothing. If the selection is just a caret, BACKSPACE deletes the character to the left of the caret and places it in the backspace buffer.

APPLE-BACKSPACE means "backword", that is, it deletes characters to the left of the caret and places them in the backspace buffer until the first character of a word has been deleted.
