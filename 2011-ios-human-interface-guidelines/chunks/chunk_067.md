People often expect to use their iOS-based devicesin any orientation. You need to determine how to respond to this expectation, within the context of your app and the task it enables.  
**In all orientations, maintain focus on the primary content**. This is your highest priority. People use your application to view and interact with the content they care about. Altering the focus on that content in different orientations can make people feel that they've lost control over the application.  
**Think twice before preventing your application from running in all orientations**. People expect to use your app in different orientations, and it's best when you can fulfill that expectation. iPad users, in particular, expect to use your app in whichever orientation they're currently holding their device. But in certain cases an app needs to run in portrait only or in landscape only. If it's essential that your application run in only one orientation, you should:  
- **Launch your app in your supported orientation, regardless of the current device orientation**. For example, if your game or media-viewing application runs in landscape only, it's appropriate to launch your app in landscape, even if the device is currently in portrait. This way, if people start your application in portrait, they know to rotate the device to landscape to view the content.
- **Avoid displaying a UI element that tells people to rotate the device**. Launching in your supported orientation clearly tells people to rotate the device, if required, without adding unnecessary clutter to your UI.
- **Support both variants of an orientation**. For example, if your application runs only in landscape, people should be able to use it whether they're holding the device with the Home button on the right or on the left. And, if people rotate the device 180 degrees while using your application, it's best if you can respond by rotating your content 180 degrees.  
**If your application interprets changes in device orientation as user input, you can handle rotation in app-specific ways**. For example, if your app is a game that allows people to move game pieces by rotating the device, you can't respond to device rotation by rotating the screen. In a case like this, you should launch in either variant of your required orientation and allow people to switch between the variants until they start the main task of the application. Then, as soon as people begin the main task, you can begin responding to device movement in application-specific ways.  
**Take advantage of the one-step change in orientation to perform smoother, often faster rotations**. However, if yourscreen layout is very complicated, you might choose instead to perform a cross-fade transition when users change the orientation of the device. "Handling View Rotations" in *UIViewController Class Reference* explains how to use the one-step process in your code.  
**Pay attention to accelerometer values**. To learn more about these values and how to receive them, see *Core Motion Framework Reference*. If appropriate, your application should respond to all changes in device orientation.  
**On iPhone, anticipate users' needs when you respond to a change in device orientation**. Users often rotate their devices to landscape orientation because they want to "see more." If you respond by merely scaling up your content, you fail to meet users' expectations. Instead, you should respond by rewrapping lines of text and, if necessary, rearranging the layout of the user interface so that more content fits on the screen.  
**On iPad, strive to satisfy users' expectations by being able to run in all orientations**. The large iPad screen mitigates people's desire to rotate the device to landscape to "see more." And, because people don't pay much attention to the minimal frame of the device or the location of the Home button, they don't view the device as having a default orientation. This lack of awareness of an app's default orientation leads people to expect appsto run well in the device orientation they're currently using. As much as possible, your application should encourage people to interact with iPad from any side by providing a great experience in all orientations.  
Follow these guidelines as you design how your iPad app should handle rotation:  
● **Consider changing how you display auxiliary information orfunctionality**. Although you should make sure that the most important content is always in focus, you can respond to rotation by changing how you provide secondary content.  
#### **CHAPTER 5**  
User Experience Guidelines  
In Mail on iPad, for example, the lists of accounts and mailboxes are secondary content (the main content is the selected message). In landscape, secondary content is displayed in the left pane of a split view; in portrait, it's displayed in a popover.  
Or, consider an iPad game that displays a rectangular game board in landscape. In portrait, the game needs to redraw the board to fit well on the screen, which might result in additional space above or below the board. Instead of vertically stretching the game board to fit the space or leaving the space empty, the game could display supplemental information or objects in the additional space.  
- **Avoid gratuitous changes in layout**. As much as possible, provide a consistent experience in all orientations. A comparable experience in all orientations allows people to maintain their usage patterns when they rotate the device. For example, if your iPad app displays images in a grid while in landscape, it's not necessary to display the same information in a list while in portrait (although you might adjust the dimensions of the grid).
- **When possible, avoid reformatting information and rewrapping text on rotation**. Strive to maintain a similar format in all orientations. Especially if people are reading text, it's important to avoid causing them to lose their place when they rotate the device.
- If some reformatting is unavoidable, use animation to help people track the changes. For example, if you must add or remove a column of text in different orientations, you might choose to hide the movement of columns and simply fade in the new arrangement. To help you design appropriate rotation behavior, think about how you'd expect your content to behave if you were physically interacting with it in the real world.
- **Provide a unique launch image for each orientation**. When each orientation has a unique launch image, people experience a smooth application start regardless of the current device orientation. In contrast with the Home screen on iPhone, the iPad Home screen supports all orientations, so people are likely to start your application in the same orientation in which they quit the previous app.
