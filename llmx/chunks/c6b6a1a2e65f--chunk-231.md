<!-- Chunk 231 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 703 -->
This section focuses mostly on messages in caution alert boxes and stop alert boxes, but you can apply the principles to messages in other dialog boxes.  
Dialog boxes and alert boxes communicate to the user. It is your responsibility to make sure that the user can understand what is going on when you can't be there to explain. Dialog box and alert box messages should be descriptive rather than evaluative. When you're writing messages, try to put yourself in the place of your users and imagine how they will feel when confronted with your message.  
A good alert box message says what went wrong, why it went wrong, and what the user can do about it. Try to express everything in the user's vocabulary. Figure 11-3 shows an example of an alert box message that provides little information and doesn't suggest to the user what is really going on.

You could improve this message by describing the problem in the user's vocabulary, as shown in Figure 11-4.

To really make this alert box useful to the user, you need to provide some suggestion about what the user can do to get out of the current situation. Figure 11-5 shows the optimal alert box message for this condition.

Some dialog boxes include categories of options presented as lists of radio buttons or checkboxes with options. Often a phrase introduces the set of options. Don't include a colon after the phrase that introduces a list if that list is a complement or object of a verb or preposition in the introductory statement. In other words, don't use a colon when the introductory phrase is not a complete sentence and the items in the list complete the sentence. For example, the phrase that follows does not contain a colon:  
The objects included are  
- radio buttons
- checkboxes
- push buttons
- text boxes  
Though you may find some situations in which a colon is used to introduce a bulleted list, Apple's publications generally follow the style given in the *The Chicago Manual of Style* and *Words Into Type*, which recommend *not* using a colon in that kind of construction. Another example that illustrates when you would *not* use a colon is shown in Figure 11-6.

Use a colon after an introductory statement that contains the words *as follows* or *the following.* Figure 11-7 shows an example of when to use a colon.
