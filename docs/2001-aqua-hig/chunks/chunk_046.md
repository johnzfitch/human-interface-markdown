<span id="page-39-5"></span><span id="page-39-3"></span>When appropriate, an application's Dock tile icon can include a small badge superimposed on the icon. In Mail, for example, when a user has unread email, the Dock icon displays a red circle indicating the number of new messages. This type of badging provides important information without being obtrusive or distracting.

<span id="page-39-4"></span>If an open and inactive application needs the user's attention right away and calls the Notification Manager, the application icon in the Dock bounces. This type of notification should be reserved for errors or problems that the user needs to address right away. If you implement this kind of notification, you should also provide a way for the user to turn off the animation. When your application is active, you may wish to display an alert rather than using the Notification Manager.  
<span id="page-39-6"></span>To animate an application or document Dock tile in a Carbon application, look for functions that include CollapsedWindowDockTile. In Cocoa, use the SetApplicationIcon method of the NSApplication class or the SetMiniWindowImage method of the NSWindow class.
