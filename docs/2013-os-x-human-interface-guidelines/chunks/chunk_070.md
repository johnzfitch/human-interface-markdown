Calendar helps people manage their schedules and create and respond to events. You can integrate Calendar information into your app so that users don't need to look up or reenter information. With the Event Kit framework, you can access users' events and create, edit, or delete new events. See *Calendar and Reminders Programming Guide* for more information.

Additionally, when you perform operations on a group of events that result in significant changes to the user's Calendar, make sure the user is fully informed of the action your app is about to perform.
