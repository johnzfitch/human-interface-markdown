# **Preface**

This document describes the Lisa user interface. It is primarily for people who want to develop applications for the Lisa Office System using the Toolkit, but may also be of use to those who just want to learn more about the Lisa interface.

The Lisa user interface is the common part of the ways in which the user and the Lisa applications interact. The version of the interface described in this document is the "ideal" version. Usually, but by no means always, it matches the way the applications already released behave. However, there are many deviations from this standard in these applications. Wherever the behavior of an application and the behavior in this document disagree, the user should assume that this document describes the way we think the interface should behave, rather than the way it does behave.

Each section of this document consists of three parts:

- 1) A general description of the feature from the user's point of view.
- 2) Under the heading Details, additional nitty-gritty details about the feature. These details are of interest only to those planning to develop applications.
- 3) Under the heading Implementation, a brief discussion of what a developer needs to know in order to implement the feature. Mostly, this just tells you whether the feature is provided by the Toolkit, and if so, by which component. For more details, refer to the Lisa Applications Toolkit reference manual.

A note on terminology: This document mostly doesn't distinguish between things that are done by the Toolkit and things that are done by an application that uses the Toolkit. Therefore, when we say "the application does this or that," it may be that actually the Toolkit does it, but from the user's point of view, it is all done by the application. The only place where the distinction between the application and the Toolkit is relevant is in the Implementation sections.

To get the most from this document, you should be pretty familiar with the Lisa Office System. It is especially helpful to have learned to use LisaWrite, LisaDraw, and either LisaCalc or LisaGraph. Where relevant, this document takes examples from these and the other first release applications.

For those who want to become more familiar with the Office System, hands-on experience is essential. In addition, the following materials should be helpful:
