The controls described in this section allow users to modify how information is presented to them in a window. Some view controls allow you to provide additional information or functionality that remains hidden until users choose to see it, and others give you a frame for organizing and displaying data, such as a list.  
<span id="page-328-1"></span>**Important:** The controls described in this section are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the window-frame areas. See ["Window-Frame](#page-254-1) Controls" (page 255) for controls designed specifically for use in the toolbar and bottom-bar areas in your window.
