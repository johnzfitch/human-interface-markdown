<!-- Chunk 8 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 433 -->
These guidelines apply to BASIC and assembly language programs and their calls to Monitor service routines.  
Have any greeting program's first action be to determine if an 80-column text card is in the system (see Peripheral Card Firmware section below for identification methods).  
- 2. Make sure that an 80-column card is installed before attempting to turn it on; otherwise, unpredictable system conditions may result.
- 3. To turn on the Apple Ile 80-column firmware, use PR#3 or the equivalent. The Apple 80-column firmware is associated with slot 3 for compatibility with the Apple Pascal Operating System.
- 4. Do not use PR#0 to turn off the 80-column firmware. To turn it off, issue a CONTROL-U (NAK character; decimal code 21).
- 5. Never have a program issue a PR#0 or IN#0 while the 80-column firmware is active.
- 6. Before sending output to devices other than the video display, issue a CONTROL-L (Form Feed character, decimal code 12) to clear the screen, then a CONTROL-U to turn off the 80-column firmware.
- If the 80-column firmware is active, look at location 49152 (\$C000) directly to check for a keypress. If you use the BASIC GET command or the Monitor KEYIN routine, each Esc keypress will be executed before its modifying escape code can be retrieved.
- 8. If the 80-column firmware is active, a program should not attempt to display flashing lowercase characters; they are not available in the alternate character set.
- 9. If your software turns on the 80-column firmware, be sure it turns it off before ending.  
The Pascal Operating System automatically checks for the presence of an 80-column text card in slot 3 or the AUX CONNECTOR slot, and turns on the 80-column firmware if such a card is present.
