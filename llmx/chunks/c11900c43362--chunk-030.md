<!-- Chunk 30 | Source: 1987 Apple Human Interface Guidelines - The Apple Desktop Interface.pdf | Est. Tokens: 2257 -->
A window is <sup>a</sup> frame for viewing something, as determined by the application. For example, each MacWrite window provides <sup>a</sup> view into <sup>a</sup> written document. To provide <sup>a</sup> common framework for the many kinds of information that users work with, windows are highly standardized (Figure 2-2).  
Because more than one window can be viewed at once, users can arrange things the way they like and move information between windows. Because windows can overlap, users can "set aside" information yet still have ready access to it.  
Manipulating windows—moving them, overlapping them, resizing them—does not affect the content of the windows, only the user's view of it.Again, this lets users tailor their work environment without fundamentally changing the elements in this environment.
