Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides several images you can use as standalone icons in toolbars. These images represent three types of items:  
- System entities or elements
- Preferences categories  
#### ● Common toolbar items  
Use the first set of images (shown in Table 11-3) to give users access to system entities, such as Dot Mac and network. For the most part, the images in Table 11-3 identify system entities, they do not represent actions. However, if you needed to represent an action, such as "create a new smart folder," you could add a plus sign badge to the smart folder icon.

|       | Network or Internet                      | NSImageNameNetwork        |  
<span id="page-158-1"></span>The second set of images is intended for use as standalone icons in preferences window toolbars. Use these images to give users access to familiar preferences categories, such as user-account settings and advanced settings. Table 11-4 shows the images you can use in a preferences window toolbar.  
**Table 11-4** Images that represent common preferences categories  
| Image | Preferences category | Constant name                 |

|       | General              | NSImageNamePreferencesGeneral |
|       | User accounts        | NSImageNameUserAccounts       |  
The third set of images is suitable for toolbar items in windows other than preferences windows. You can use these images asstandalone iconsin a window or panel toolbar to give users accessto the system-provided Colors and Fonts windows or to an Info or inspector window you supply.
