In applications in which users can format data for printing, publish to the web, or write to film, DVD, or other formats, make sure there are no significant differences between what users see onscreen and what theyreceive in the final output. When the user makes changes to a document, displaythe results immediately; the user shouldn't have to wait for the final output or make mental calculations about how the document will look later. Use a preview function if necessary.  
People should be able to find all the available features in your application. Don't hide features by failing to make commands available in a menu. Menus present lists of commands so that people can see their choices rather than try to remember command names. Avoid providing access to features only in toolbars or contextual menus. Because toolbars and contextual menus may be hidden, the commands they contain should always be available in menu bar menus as well.
