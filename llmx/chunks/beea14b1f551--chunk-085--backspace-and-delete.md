#### **Backspace and Delete**  
The Backspace or Delete key deletes text or graphics. Generally, if a selection has been made, pressing Backspace or Delete deletes the selection without putting it in the Clipboard—and without backspacing the insertion point. If there is no selection, pressing Backspace or Delete deletes the character to the left of the insertion point without putting it in the Clipboard.
