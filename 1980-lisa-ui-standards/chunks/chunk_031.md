All characters including commands invoked with the Apple key may be typed ahead. The initial press of a key always types ahead, but auto repeat characters will not be typed ahead. Mouse button— ahead is normally disabled, but may be turned on by the User Profile.  
When an application detects a keyboard error, it may beep, delay a short time, then flush the type ahead buffer.  
The length of the type-ahead buffer is sufficient to hold a line of text.
