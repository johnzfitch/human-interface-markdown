Aesthetic integrity means that information is well organized and consistent with principles of good visual design. Your product should look pleasant on the screen, even when viewed for a long time.  
Keep graphics simple, and use them onlywhen theytrulyenhance usability. Don't overloadwindows and dialogs with dozens of icons or buttons. Don't use arbitrary symbols to represent concepts; they may confuse or distract users. The overall layout of your windows and design of user interface elements should reflect the user's mental model of the task your application performs. See ["Reflect](#page-31-0) the User's [Mental](#page-31-0) Model " (page 32) for more information on this concept.  
When implementing your user interface, there are many things you can do to ensure high quality. For example:  
- All icons should be rendered at the highest quality(see ["Icons"](#page-122-0) (page 123) for extensiveguidelines for icon design).
- All text should be anti-aliased, which is automatic when you use the standard system fonts (see ["Fonts"](#page-116-1) (page 117) for more information).
- The font size and type should be consistent within a window (see ["Text"](#page-116-0) (page 117) for more information on the font sizes and styles available to you).
- The control size should be consistentwithin awindow—for example, don't mix small and standard controls (see ["Controls"](#page-220-0) (page 221) for more information on the controls Mac OS X supplies).  
Match a graphic element with a user's likely expectations of its behavior. Don't change the meaning or behavior of standard items. For example:  
- Always use checkboxes for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices
- Use push buttons for immediate commands such as "Open"
