## Define Your Audience

There are several steps to involving users in your design process. The first step, done at the beginning of a project, is to define the users and then do an analysis of the target audience. You want to determine what these people are like, how they might use a product like yours, if they have any similar products, and what features they would desire in your product. By doing some research on your target audience, you can find out if what you're including in or adding to a product is desirable and useful.
