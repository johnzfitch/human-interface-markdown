Mac OS X reserves two key combinations as new equivalents to menu commands that affect all applications:  
- Command-H is reserved as an equivalent to the "Hide <appName>" menu command that appears in the Application menu of all applications.
- Command-M is reserved as an equivalent to the Minimize menu command in the Window menu. It applies to any active window that can be minimized. The command initiated in Mac OS 9 by Command-M, Make Alias, now has the keyboard equivalent Command-L.
