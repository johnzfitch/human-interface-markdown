#### **Tearing Off an Attached Submenu**

The user can *tear off* an attached submenu by dragging it away from its supermenu. Moving it free of its supermenu gives it an independent life on-screen. As a sign of its independence, it gets, for the first time, its own close button. The close button identifies the menu as a tom-off submenu. (Any submenus that were attached to the tom-off submenu move with it and remain attached.)
