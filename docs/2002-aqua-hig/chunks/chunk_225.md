Some applications that represent objects, such as QuickTime Player and Calculator, are most easily recognized by the objects themselves. When creating icons for such applications, it's more aesthetically pleasing to create a simplified, idealized representation of the object, rather than using an actual screen shot of the software. Re-creating the object is particularly important when users could confuse the icon with the actual interface.

These icons, many of which are a precursor of what you'll see when you open the application, use a straight-on perspective (rather than the "on a desktop" user application style). You never see the Calculator on screen in three dimensions, for example, so its icon doesn't depict it that way.
