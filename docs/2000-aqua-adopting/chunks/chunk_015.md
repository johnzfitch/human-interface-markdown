The Human Interface Toolkit includes smaller versions of some controls. These small versions should be used sparingly; your first choice in designing for Aqua should be to use the full-size controls. If you are designing windows such as palettes or utility windows, you may need to use small versions of a given control when space is at a premium and the window cannot be redesigned to allow the full-size version. You may also find it necessary to use smaller controls when converting existing designs for use with Aqua.  
In the sections describing individual control types, a figure describing the small version of a given control (when a small version is available) immediately follows the figure that describe the full-size version. Again, you should use the smaller version of controls only when absolutely necessary.
