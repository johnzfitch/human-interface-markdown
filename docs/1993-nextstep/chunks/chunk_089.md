Most standard windows-especially those with scrollable contents-should have a resize bar. It gives users control of their environment by letting them choose how much screen space to devote to the contents of th~ window.  
If a window has a resize bar, you should be careful that the window remains as useful and attractive as possible, no matter how small or large it becomes. Each window can constrain its shape so that it doesn't become too big or too small, or so that it grows and shrinks in unit amounts. For example, the Workspace Manager File Viewer grows and shrinks only by the width of its browser columns, which eliminates the possibility of showing only a partial column.
