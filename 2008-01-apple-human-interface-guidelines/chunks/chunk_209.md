A scope bar is a horizontal strip that can appear just belowyour application's toolbar. It can be visible at all times, but is usually invisible until the user initiates an operation such as a search or find.  
Although a scope bar may contain a search field control, it often contains only two types of controls, both of which are designed solely for use in a scope bar. The first control is the recessed-style scope button, which is used to display scoping locations and categories. The second is the round rectangle–style scope button, which is used to save or manipulate a scoping operation (for details on these controls, see "Scope [Buttons"](#page-273-0) (page 274)).  
You can also display filter rows below a scope bar that allow users to specify additional rules that help refine the scoping operation. In addition to the round rectangle–style scope button (used for selecting or saving scoping criteria), a filter row can also contain text fields that accept user input. For example, when users search in the Finder, they can click the Add button to view a new row with supplementary rules they can use to refine their search. Figure 14-20 shows a Finder window with several filter rows displayed below the scope bar.

#### Designing a Scope Bar  
Scope bars are useful for integrating search or filtering in your application. You might choose to provide a scope bar (instead of a separate Find window, for example) if you want the user's focus to remain on the window. Be sure that you use a scope bar only to specify and narrow a search or to filteritems byspecified criteria. Ifyou need to provide awayfor users to navigate orto select collections of items or data that should appear in the window, however, you should use a source list instead (described in "Source Lists and [Sidebars"](#page-209-0) (page 210)). For example, the Dictionary application uses a scope bar to allow users to dynamically filter results by reference type (such as dictionary, thesaurus, or Apple dictionary), as shown in Figure 14-21.

Asyou choose the locations and categories that should appear in a scope bar, revisit the user's mental model of the tasks your application performs. (See ["Reflect](#page-41-0) the User's Mental Model" (page 42) for more information on discovering this cognitive model.) Determine the objects the user works with, and identify the attributes of those objects. For example, an application that allows users to create, use, and store recipes might display a scope bar when the user begins a search, providing buttons that correspond to different recipe collections.  
<span id="page-209-0"></span>If appropriate, allow users to define subsets of the locations and categories you offer by providing filter rows that display additional rules and filtering criteria. For example, the recipe application described above could display filter rows that allow users to filter their results by ingredient, cuisine, seasonal availability, complexity, date last used, diet type, and other criteria. You should also allow users to save their searches. As shown in [Figure](#page-208-0) 14-20 (page 209), the Finder offers many types of additional filtering functionality and the ability to save searches.
