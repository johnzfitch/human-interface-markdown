## **How to Use Dragging**

Dragging is used in a variety of situations, principally these three:

- To move an object, such as a window or the knob of a scroller
- To define a range, usually to select the objects falling within the range
- To slide from one object to another, in order to extend an action initiated in the first object to the second object
