#### **Dragging**  
The user *drags* by pressing a mouse button and moving the mouse (and cursor) while the button is down.  
In general, every dragging action implies a click. Dragging a window, for example, also brings it to the front, as if it had been clicked. However, sometimes it's appropriate to separate an object's response to dragging from its response to clicking. See "When Dragging Shouldn't Imply Clicking," later in this chapter, for infonnation on when dragging should not imply a click.
