**In general, avoid increasing control sizes.** If you use the minimum tappable size for controlsin your app—that is, no smaller than 44 x 44 points—you should not need to adjust them for iPhone 5. However, you might choose to add a little more space between existing controls.  
**Don't use the extra space to display an additional bar or banner.** People expect to see more content on iPhone 5. To avoid disappointing your users, resist the temptation to use the extra vertical space for a custom button bar or banner.
