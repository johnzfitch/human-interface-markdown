You are strongly encouraged to use the standard Aqua controls in your app. When you do this, you benefit in three important ways:  
- When users see familiar controls, they can begin to enjoy your app immediately, rather than spend time figuring out how it works.
- Aqua controls are automatically updated whenever the OS X UI is refreshed, which means that you don't have to produce a new version of your app to take advantage of the new look.
- Standard AppKit controls automatically render correctly at any resolution, which means you do not have to provide separate resources for standard and high resolution displays.  
**Avoid mixing control sizes in the same view.** Many controls are available in three sizes: regular, small, and mini. In most cases, you want to use regular-size controls in your windows. When space is at a premium, such as in a panel or within a pane, you might want to use small or (less often) mini controls. Although in rare cases a pane might contain small controls while the surrounding window contains regular controls, it's best to avoid mixing different sizes of controls in the same window. (Note that all panes in a window should use controls of the same size.)  
**In general, avoid resizing controls vertically.** Many controls can be resized horizontally, but most controls are fixed vertically for each available size. If you vertically resize some controls, you might trigger unexpected results, such as a change in control style.  
**Use the proper text size and font within a control.** For example, a regular-size control generally uses the regular system font for text that appears within it, such as "OK" in a button or a menu item name in a pop-up menu. When you create your UI in Interface Builder, you automatically get the proper font and size for each standard control you use.  
**Use the proper spacing between controls.** When controls are spaced evenly in a window, the window is more attractive and easier for usersto use. The layout guidesin Interface Buildershow you the recommended spacing between controls and between UI elements and window edges.  
**Note:** Every control described in this chapter is accompanied by at least one illustration that shows an example of the control. These images do not necessarily exhibit the precise measurements or colors you would observe in a running app.  
For thisreason, you should never measure the imagesin this document and use those measurements to create custom controls or other UI elements. Note that when you use Interface Builder to create your user interface, you automatically get the proper control sizes.
