A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (showor hide)while the parentwindowis open. A drawer should contain frequentlyaccessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. A drawer's contents should be closely related to the contents of its parent window. A drawer automatically inherits the brushed metal appearance if its parent window is brushed metal (see "Brushed Metal [Windows](#page-178-0) " (page 179).
