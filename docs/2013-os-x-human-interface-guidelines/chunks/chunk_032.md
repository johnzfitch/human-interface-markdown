Aesthetic integrity means that information is well organized and consistent with principles of good visual design. Your product should look pleasant on the screen, even when viewed for a long time.  
Keep graphics simple, and use them only when they truly enhance usability. Don't overload windows and dialogs with dozens of icons or buttons. Don't use arbitrary symbols to represent concepts; they may confuse or distract users. The overall layout of your windows and design of user interface elements should reflect the user's mental model of the task your app performs. See ["Mental](#page-26-2) Model" (page 27) for more information on this concept.  
When implementing your user interface, there are many things you can do to ensure high quality. For example:  
- All icons should be rendered at the highest quality (see "Icon Design [Guidelines"](#page-109-0) (page 110) for extensive guidelines for icon design).
- All text should be anti-aliased, which is automatic when you use the standard system fonts.
- The font size and type should be consistent within a window (see "Text Style [Guidelines"](#page-297-0) (page 298) for more information on the font sizes and styles available to you).
- The controlsize should be consistent within a window—for example, don't mix small and standard controls (see "UI Element [Guidelines:](#page-236-0) Controls" (page 237) for more information on the controls OS X supplies).  
Match a graphic element with a user'slikely expectations of its behavior. Don't change the meaning or behavior of standard items. For example:  
- Always use checkboxes for multiple choices, not for mutually exclusive choices
- Use push buttons for immediate commands such as "Open"
- Avoid using push buttons to display pop-up menus or serve as tabs
- Avoid using bevel buttons as tabs
