#### The Apple (or Command) key  
The Apple key islabeled on different computers with an Apple symbol, a cloverleaf symbol, or both. It has also been known as the Command key or Open Apple key. Pressing <sup>a</sup> character key while holding down the Apple key usually tells the application to interpret the key as a command, not as a character. In some applications, the Apple key is used with other keys to provide special functions or shortcuts—for example, pressing Apple-Shift-3 on a Macintosh saves, on disk, a snapshot of the current screen. The Apple (or Command) key can also be used in conjunction with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag.
