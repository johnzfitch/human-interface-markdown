As much as possible, it's a good idea to use the standard UI elementsthat UIKit provides. When you use standard elements instead of creating custom ones, both you and your users benefit:  
- Standard UI elements automatically receive updates if iOS introduces a redesigned appearance—custom elements don't get updated.
- Standard UI elements tend to offer various ways to customize their appearance or behavior. For example, all views (that is, objects that inherit from UIView) are tintable, which makes it easy to add color to an app. To learn more about adding color to UI elements, see "Using Tint Color" in *iOS 7 UI Transition Guide* .
- People are comfortable with the standard UI elements, so they instantly understand how to use them in your app.  
To take advantage of the benefits of using standard UI elements, it's crucial that you:  
**Follow the guidelines for every UI element.** When a UI element looks and works the way people expect it to, they can depend on their prior experience to help them use it in your app. You can find UI element guidelines in ["Bars"](#page-142-0) (page 143), ["Content](#page-155-0) Views" (page 156), ["Controls"](#page-181-0) (page 182), and ["Temporary](#page-196-0) Views" (page 197).  
**Don't mix UI element styles from different versions of iOS.** You don't want to confuse users by displaying UI elements that look like they belong in a different version of iOS than the version that's currently running on the device.  
**In general, avoid creating a custom UI element that performs a standard action.** First, ask yourself why you're creating a custom UI element that behaves exactly like a standard one. If you just want a custom look, consider changing the look of a standard element by using the UIKit appearance customization APIs or tint  
color. If you want a slightly different behavior, be sure to find out whether a standard element might do what you want when you adjust its properties and attributes. If you need completely custom behavior, it's best to design a custom element that doesn't look too similar to the standard ones.

**Tip:** Interface Builder makes it easy to get the standard UI elements, use the appearance customization APIs, access properties and attributes, and apply custom and system provided icons to your controls. To learn more about Interface Builder, see *Xcode Overview*.  
**Don't use system-defined buttons and icons to mean something else.** iOS provides many buttons and icons that you can use in your app. Be sure you understand the documented, semantic meaning of these buttons and icons; don't rely on your interpretation of their appearance. (You can find the meaning of each icon in "Toolbar and [Navigation](#page-147-0) Bar Buttons" (page 148) and "Tab Bar [Icons"](#page-151-0) (page 152).)  
If you can't find a system provided button or icon that has the appropriate meaning for a function in your app, you can create your own. For some guidelines to help you design custom icons, see "Bar [Button](#page-217-0) Icons" (page 218).
