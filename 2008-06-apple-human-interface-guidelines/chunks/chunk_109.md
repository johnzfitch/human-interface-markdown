You should support drag-and-drop installation if your application bundle contains everything needed for the application to run. However, you might need to create an installation package if any of the following conditions is true:  
- You need to install frameworks or other files in specific locations on the user's system.
- You need to install software on any part of the system that requires administrative access.  
If you are developing software other than an application, the need for an installation package depends on the type of software and where it is installed. For example, you might want to use an installer to install a screen saver, because it involves placing files in either the user's Library directory or the local Library directory.
