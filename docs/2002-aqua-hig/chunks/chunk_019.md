<span id="page-23-6"></span>APIs, frameworks, and other tools are available to help you implement the design principles and interface specifications described in this document.  
- **Interface Builder** provides a rich environment for creating application menus, windows, dialogs, palettes, and other standard Aqua interface elements. It provides full Cocoa support. Carbon developers can also make their applications Aqua-compliant by using Interface Builder to create nib files.
- [Interface Builder is on the Mac OS X Developer Tools CD, or you can download](http://developer.apple.com/membership/index.html)  [it from the Apple Developer Connection website \(http://developer.apple.com/](http://developer.apple.com/membership/index.html) [membership/index.html\)](http://developer.apple.com/membership/index.html).
- <span id="page-23-4"></span><span id="page-23-3"></span><span id="page-23-2"></span>■ **The JFC/Swing Toolkit** provides the Aqua look and feel for applications written using Java. For more information, go to http://java.sun.com/products/jfc[/.](http://java.sun.com/SFC)
- **The Appearance Manager.** If your application is Carbon-based but uses custom controls, use the Appearance Manager to unify these elements with the rest of the Aqua interface. The Appearance Manager provides a variety of functions you can use to handle most aspects of drawing and tracking so that controls in your application look and behave correctly in both the Aqua and Graphite themes.
