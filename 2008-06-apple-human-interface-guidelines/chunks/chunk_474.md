Grouping related controls helps users understand what particular controls do and helps them locate the controls that affect the specific actions they want to perform. This section provides examples of different ways to group controls.  
The three examples show different ways to group the same set of controls within a tabbed window using three grouping elements:  
- White space, shown in [Figure](#page-349-2) 16-18 (page 350)
- Separators, shown in [Figure](#page-350-2) 16-20 (page 351)
- Group boxes, shown in [Figure](#page-351-0) 16-21 (page 352)  
<span id="page-348-1"></span>Note that none of these examples are more or less correct than any other. The effectiveness of a layout in your application depends on the overall aesthetic of your other windows as well as your application's workflow.
