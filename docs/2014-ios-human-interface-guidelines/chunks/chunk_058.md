Keynote users instantly understand how to use the app on iPad because it delivers expected functionality using native iPad paradigms. New users easily learn how to use Keynote on iPad because they can directly manipulate their content in simple, natural ways.  
The transformation of Keynote from the desktop to iPad is based on myriad modifications and redesigns that range from subtle to profound. These are some of the most visible adaptations:  
**A streamlined toolbar.** Only a handful of items are in the toolbar, but they give users consistent access to all the functions and tools they need to create their content.

**A simplified, prioritized inspector that responds to the user's focus.** The Keynote on iPad inspector automatically contains the tools and attributes people need to modify the selected object. Often, people can make all the modifications they need in the first inspector view. If they need to modify less frequently changed attributes, they can drill down to other inspector views.

**Lots of prebuilt style collections.** People can easily change the look and feel of objects such as charts and tables by taking advantage of the prebuiltstyles. In addition to colorscheme, each collection includes prestyled attributes, such as table headings and axis-division marks, that are designed to coordinate with the overall theme.

**Direct manipulation of content, enriched with meaningful animation.** In Keynote on iPad, a user drags a slide to a new position, twists an object to rotate it, and taps an image to select it. The impression of direct manipulation is enhanced by the responsive animations Keynote on iPad performs. For example, a slide pulses gently as users move it and, when they place it in a new location, the surrounding slides ripple outward to make room for it.
