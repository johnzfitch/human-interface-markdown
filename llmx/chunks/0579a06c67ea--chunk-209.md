Character keys include keys for letters, numbers, and punctuation, as well as the Space bar. If the user presses one of these keys while entering text, the corresponding character is added to the text. Nonprinting characters such as the Enter, Tab, Return, Delete (or Backspace), Clear, and Escape (Esc) keys are also treated like character keys.
