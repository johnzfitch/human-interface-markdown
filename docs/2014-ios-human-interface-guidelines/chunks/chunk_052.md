Imagine that your initial idea is to develop an app that helps people shop for groceries. As you think about this activity, you come up with a list of related tasks—that is, potential features—that users might be interested in. For example:  
- Creating lists
- Getting recipes
- Comparing prices
- Locating stores
- Annotating recipes
- Getting and using coupons
- Viewing cooking demos
- Exploring different cuisines
- Finding ingredient substitutions
