Fundamentally, users delight in applications that seem to understand them, anticipating their needs and providing them with powerful, intuitive, and streamlined solutions. The best way to follow this guideline is to keep the user's mental model firmly in mind as you design your application (for a discussion of this concept, see ["Reflect](#page-39-0) the User's Mental [Model"](#page-39-0) (page 40)).
