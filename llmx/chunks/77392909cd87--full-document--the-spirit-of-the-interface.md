# The Spirit of the Interface

This section outlines the principles behind the Apple human interface—the *spirit* of the interface. These principles are not limited to the present "desktop" interface—they are more general than that and will still be valid when new interface metaphors are found. For example, computers will always provide views of information, but not necessarily by means of "windows."
