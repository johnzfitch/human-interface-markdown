When people share information, it is important to be able to identify all the people who are participating in the collaboration. You should allow the owner of shared resources to be able to obtain as much information as possible, such as the name, location, and access privileges, about the people who are using the shared resource. Finding out that another person is using a machine as a "guest" provides no useful information and prevents the owner from further communication in case of a problem or situation that requires it.
