#### **Modifier Keys**

The keyboard's Shift, Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys are *modifier keys:* They change the effect of a keyboard or mouse action. For example, Shift-3 yields #, and Command-c issues a Copy command. Unlike character keys, modifier keys by themselves don't generate characters.

To use a modifier key, the user must hold the key down and, while keeping it down, press the key (or perform the mouse action) to be modified. More than one modifier key may be used at a time-for example, Command-Shift-C.

The modifier keys and their effects when used with other keys are presented below.

- The Shift key modifies keystrokes to produce the uppercase character on letter keys and the upper character on two-character keys.
- The Alternate key modifies keystrokes to produce an alternate character to the one that appears on the key. In general, these are special characters that are used relatively infrequently. To find out which alternate characters are generated by which keys, see the *User's Guide.*
- The Control key modifies keystrokes to produce standard ASCII control characters. Some control characters are generated by single character keys-for example, Tab is Control-i, Return is Control-m, and backspace (Shift-Delete) is the same as Control-h.
- The Command key provides a way of choosing commands with the keyboard rather than the mouse. As an alternative to clicking a menu command with the mouse, the user can press the Command key in conjunction with the character displayed in the menu next to that command. For example, Command-c chooses the Copy command.
- The Help key doesn't modify keystrokes. It's used only to modify mouse actions, as described in "Using Modifier Keys with the Mouse" in this chapter.
