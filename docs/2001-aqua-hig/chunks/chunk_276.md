- Do you have high-quality Aqua-style icons?
- Do the graphics resemble items that users are familiar with? Did you leave out insignificant detail (which unnecessarily complicates a graphic)?
- Do windows, dialogs, and palettes look "clean" and free from clutter?
- Does the user have control over the design of the workspace (location and sizing of windows, toolbar customization), allowing him or her to individualize it?
- Is the information in windows organized so the most important information can be read first?
- Do you use a consistent light source, one that always comes from the center top of the screen?
- Do you use white space and graphics to break up long pieces of text?
