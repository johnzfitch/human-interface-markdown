The **Edit menu** commands allow people to change (that is, edit) the contents of documents and other text containers, such as fields. It also provides commands that allow people to share data, within and between apps, through the Clipboard.  
![](images/_page_93_Picture_3.jpeg)  
Even if your app doesn't handle text editing within its documents, the expected Edit commands should be available for use in dialogs and wherever users can edit text.  
The Edit menu includes the following standard menu items, listed in the order in which they should appear.  
| Menu item | Expected | Keyboard shortcut | Meaning                                                                                                                                                     |

**As much as possible, support undo and redo functionality.** In particular, support the Undo command for:  
- Operations that change the contents of a document
- Operations that require a lot of effort to re-create
- Most menu items
- Most keyboard input  
It might not be possible to support undo for every operation users can perform in your app. For example, selecting, scrolling, splitting a window, and changing a window's size and location aren't necessarily undoable.  
**Let the user know when Undo isn't possible.** If the last operation can't be reversed, change the command to Can't Undo and display it dimmed to help the user understand that the action isn't available.  
If a user attempts to perform an operation that could have a detrimental effect on data and that can't be undone, warn the user. For more information on how to do this, see [Alerts](#page-171-0) (page 172).  
**Add the name of the last undo or redo operation to the Undo and Redo commands, respectively.** If the last operation was a menu command, add the command name. For example, if the user has just entered some text, the Undo command could read Undo Typing. If the user chooses Undo Typing, the Redo command should then read Redo Typing, and the Undo command should include the name of the operation the user performed *before* typing.  
**Don't change the Delete menu item name.** Choosing Delete is the equivalent of pressing the Delete key or the Clear key. Use Delete as the menu command, not Clear or Erase or anything else.  
**Determine the best placement for the Find command.** For example, the Find command could be in the File menu, instead of the Edit menu, if the object of the search is files. When appropriate, your app should also contain a Find/Replace command.  
**Provide a Find submenu, if appropriate.** You might want to include a Find submenu if find is important functionality in your app. Typically, a Find submenu contains Find (Command-F), Find Next (Command-G), Find Previous (Shift-Command-G), Use Selection for Find (Command-E), and Jump to Selection (Command-J). If you include a Find submenu, the Find menu item name should not include an ellipsis character.  
**Group Find Next with Find.** Whether you place the Find command in the File menu or the Edit menu, this item should be grouped with the Find command because users think of them together.  
**Provide a Spelling submenu, if appropriate.** If your app provides multiple spelling-related commands, you might want to include a Spelling submenu that contains Check Spelling (Command-;) and Check Spelling as You Type commands. If you include a Spelling submenu, the Spelling menu item name should not include an ellipsis character.
