#### Color Labeling Mechanism for Color Icons

The labeling mechanism tints color icons toward the label color chosen by the user from the Label menu. Figure 8-26 shows some icons and the same icons in their labeled state. To provide system support for this technique, it was necessary to limit the number of colors used in icons. Using the 34 identified icon colors does not guarantee that labeled icons will look good, only that they will actually look labeled. As with icons that are selected, the tinting applies to only the 34 colors. As a result, if you use colors other than the 34 colors in your icon, the icon will not look labeled when a label color is applied.
