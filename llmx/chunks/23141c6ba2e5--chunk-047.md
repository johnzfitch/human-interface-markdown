Providing universal access means creating products that all people can use, including people who have a disability. Approximately forty-three million people in the United States alone have some type of disability. Computers hold tremendous promise for people with many kinds of disabilities. In terms of increasing productivity and mobility, computers can have a far greater impact on people with a disability than on other users.  
It's a good idea to build in support for universal access for several reasons. First, United States law mandates that computer manufacturers that provide office equipment to their organizations and agencies provide access for users with a disability. Second, it makes sense to plan ahead and incorporate support for universal access from the beginning of your design process rather than having to add it after your product is done.  
When you think about designing for the wide range of abilities in your target audience, think about increasing the amount of productivity for the entire audience and be careful not to overcompensate for the special needs of certain members of the group. Don't add features for disability access that get in the way of able users. The features you include should be additional ways to access the hardware or software, not primary ways of input and output that make it more difficult for other, nondisabled users.  
In general, if you follow the design principles described in Chapter 1, "Human Interface Principles," beginning on page 3, you will meet the needs of most of your users. This section describes the main categories of disabilities and gives suggestions for specific design solutions and adaptations you can make.
