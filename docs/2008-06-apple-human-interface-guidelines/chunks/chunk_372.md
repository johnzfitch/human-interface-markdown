**Control sizes**: The height of a combo box is fixed for each size, but its width should be wide enough to accommodate the longest list item.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: The text of the list items in a combo box should be in a font that is proportional to the size of the control. The text of the introductory label should be an emphasized version of the same font. Use the following metrics and specifications for a combo box:  
- Regular size:
- ❏ List-item text: System font. This font is automatically supplied by Interface Builder.
- ❏ Introductory label: Emphasized system font. Leave 8 pixels between the end of the text (colon) and the left edge of the control.
- Small:
- ❏ List-item text: Small system font. This font is automatically supplied by Interface Builder.
- ❏ Introductory label: Emphasized smallsystem font. Leave 6 pixels between the end of the text (colon) and the left edge of the control.
