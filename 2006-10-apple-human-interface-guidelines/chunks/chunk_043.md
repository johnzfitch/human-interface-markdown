Direct manipulation is an example of an implied action that allows users to feel that theyare controlling the objects represented bythe computer. Accordingto this principle, an onscreen object should remain visible while a user performs an action on it, and the impact of the action should be immediately visible. For example, with a drag-and-drop operation (the most common example of direct manipulation) users can move a file by draggingits icon from one location to another, or dragselected text directly into another document. Other examples of direct manipulation are the resizing of a graphic object in a drawing application and the positioning of an object or camera view in a three-dimensional scene.  
Support direct manipulation when users are likely to expect it. Avoid forcing users to use controls to manipulate data. For example, an application that manages a virtual library might allow the user to drag a book icon onto a patron's name to check it out. Such direct manipulation supports the user's mental model of the task and is much more natural than opening a window, selecting a book title, selecting a patron name, and clicking a Check Out button. (For more information on the concept of a mental model, see ["Reflect](#page-39-0) the User's Mental Model" (page 40).)
