<span id="page-52-1"></span>This section describes how to extend the Mac OS X user interface when your application requires an element or a behavior that doesn't already exist. When a need arises that can't be met by the standard elements, you can extend the set of controls using these guidelines, provided that the new element or behavior supports Apple's interface design principles. This section contains information on how to determine when it's appropriate to go beyond the guidelines, how to use the existing interface elements to build new elements, and what to avoid when you design additional interface elements.
