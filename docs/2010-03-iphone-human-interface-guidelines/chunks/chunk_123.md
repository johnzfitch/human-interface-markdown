A **label** is a variably sized amount of static text. Figure 9-5 shows an example of a label.

You can use a label to name parts of your user interface or to provide limited help to the user. A label is best suited to display a relatively small amount of text.  
You can determine various properties of the label's text, such as font, text color, and alignment, but above all, you should take care to make your labels legible. Don't sacrifice clarity for fancy fonts or showy colors.  
As you compose the text of your labels, be sure to use the user's vocabulary. Examine the text in your application for developer-centric terms and replace them with user-centric terms.
