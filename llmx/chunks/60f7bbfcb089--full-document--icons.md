### **Icons**

Icons are graphic representations of disks, applications, folders, documents, and the trash can. The user can drag icons around on the desktop (if it can't be dragged, it's not an icon).

Figure 36. Five Kinds of Icons

Icons can contribute greatly to the clarity and attractiveness of an application. They can provide concrete representations of abstract concepts such as open, select, and save. The use of icons instead of words also makes it much easier to translate programs into other languages. Wherever an explanation or label is needed, consider using an icon in addition to (or instead of) text—but, like everything else, don't overdo it!
