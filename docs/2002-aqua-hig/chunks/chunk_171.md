In text, the Return key inserts a carriage return (a line break) and moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next line. In arrays, the Return key signals movement to the leftmost field one step lower (like a carriage return on a typewriter). Like Tab, pressing Return can cause data to be entered before focus moves to the next item.  
If a dialog has a default button, pressing Return (or Enter) is the same as clicking it.
