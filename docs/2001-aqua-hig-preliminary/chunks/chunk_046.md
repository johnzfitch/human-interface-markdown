A **checkmark** next to a menu item indicates that the setting applies to the entire selection. You can use checkmarks for mutually exclusive attribute groups (the user can select only one item in the group, such as font size) or accumulating attribute groups (more than one item can be selected at once, such as Bold and Italic.  
Use **dashes** to indicate that an attribute applies to only part of the selection. For example, if selected text has two styles applied to it, put a dash next to each style name. When it's appropriate, you can combine checkmarks and dashes in the same menu.  
A **bullet** appears next to a document with unsaved changes. A **diamond** appears if the user has minimized the document into the Dock.
