People with a hearing disability cannot hear auditory output at normal volume levels or cannot hear it at all. Software should never rely solely on sound to provide information; if cues are given with sound, they should be available visually as well. Since Mac OS X allows users to specify a visual cue in addition to the standard audible cue for the system alert, be sure to use the standard system alert when you need to get the user's attention.  
To indicate activity, hardware should have visible lights in addition to the sound generated by the mechanisms. Hardware that specifically produces sound should facilitate external amplification. For example, including a jack for external speakers or headphones allows people to amplify sound to an appropriate level.
