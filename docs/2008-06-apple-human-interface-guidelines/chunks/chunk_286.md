<span id="page-237-4"></span>A Find window is a modeless dialog that opens in response to the Find command to provide an interface for specifying items to search for. Its appearance can vary depending on the needs of your application, but if your application handles text you might want to make your Find window similar to the one shown in Figure 14-53 to provide a consistent user experience.

Find windows are useful in document-creation applications, because users can use one Find window to search for a term in several different documents. If your application is not document-based or if it is a single-window application, however, you might instead choose to offer find or searching functionality in a scope bar. A scope bar is attached to a window and provides both search and filtering capabilities to users. [Figure](#page-200-1) 14-19 (page 201) shows a scope bar in Safari. For more information about scope bars and how to use them in your application, see ["Scope](#page-200-0) Bars" (page 201).
