A mental model is the concept of an object or experience that people carry in their heads. As people learn and experience things—in both the real and digital worlds—they refine their mental models and build new ones.

It'simportant to acknowledge the mental modelsthat people bring to your app, because these modelsinfluence people's expectations. If you're developing an email app, for example, you need to understand how people think about email tasks (such as composing, reading, sending, and managing) and objects (such as messages, mailboxes, and addresses). But if you delve deeper, you might discover that people approach the email task with mental models that are rooted in the nondigital world. For example, people are likely to have mental models that are informed by writing, sending, and receiving physical letters. A great email app could use these insights to provide a highly intuitive and delightful user experience.  
Although you should understand the user's mental models, don't feel that you must treat them as blueprints for your app. A great app builds on existing mental models and extendsthem appropriately,so that the unique and exciting experience it offers balances familiar experiences with new ones.
