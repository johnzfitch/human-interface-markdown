#### *attention panel*  
A panel that demands the user's attention. Until the user acts to dismiss the panel from the screen, no other action within the application is possible. Attention panels permit the user to rescind a command (such as Close), ask the user to complete a command (such as Save As), and give warnings that the user must acknowledge. See also *panel* and *ordinary panel.*
