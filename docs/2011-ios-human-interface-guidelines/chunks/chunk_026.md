Aesthetic integrity is not a measure of how beautiful an application is. It's a measure of how well the appearance of the app integrates with its function. For example, an app that enables a productive task generally keeps decorative elements subtle and in the background, while giving prominence to the task by providing standard controls and behaviors. Such an app gives users a clear, unified message about its purpose and its identity. If, on the other hand, the app enables the productive task within a UI that seems whimsical or frivolous, people might not know how to interpret these contradictory signals.  
Similarly, in an app that encourages an immersive task, such as a game, users expect a beautiful appearance that promises fun and encourages discovery. Although people don't expect to accomplish a serious or productive task in a game, they still expect the game's appearance to integrate with the experience.
