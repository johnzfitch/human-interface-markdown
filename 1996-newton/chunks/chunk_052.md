An application uses a particular type of auxiliary view, a **notification alert,** to provide messages about error conditions, warn users about potentially undesirable situations or actions, and announce alarms. Use a notification alert to convey information that is useful to the user but doesn't present any threat such as a loss of data.  
The notification alert's wavy black border visually distinguishes it from operational slips. A user responds to a notification alert by tapping its Close box, thereby acknowledging the message and putting away the slip. Figure 2-16 shows a notification alert.

Some notification alerts have a Snooze button, which enables a user to temporarily dismiss the alert. The alert reappears after an interval of time chosen by the user. For example, this is the type of notification alert the built-in Date Book application uses for its reminder alarms. [Figure 2-17](#page-61-0)  shows a notification alert with a Snooze button (for more information, see ["Alarms" on page 8-4](#page-245-0).).

Before closing a notification alert, a user can tap the small circled *i* in the upper left corner to display the date and time at which the notification appeared. While any notification alert is open, the user can scroll through recent messages by using the universal scroll arrows (as described under ["Universal](#page-81-0)  [Scroll Arrows" on page 2-38\)](#page-81-0). The Newton operating system logs notification messages, handles notification message scrolling, and provides the small circled *i* and its functionality.  
When you write notification messages, use phrasing that make sense to users. Use simple, nontechnical language; don't provide system-oriented information that a user can't relate to. When possible, give users information that helps explain how to correct the problem. Be as specific as possible; if appropriate, use the name of the application or the name of the view to which the message applies. For example, "The Expense Report slip doesn't scroll" is more helpful than "This view doesn't support scrolling."
