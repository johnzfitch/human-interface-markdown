The **list box** control is a complete solution for creating scrolling lists. It provides for up to two embedded scroll bars and a scrolling list box which features a white background and a two-pixel-wide rectangular frame whose inside lines share the outside lines of the scroll bar(s). Figure 2-25 shows a list box in use.

List boxes can accept keyboard input for navigating within the list. The user can use the arrow keys to move through the list one item at a time in the direction of the arrow. Users can also select an item from the list by typing the beginning character or characters of its name; this technique is called **type selection.**  
List boxes are not appropriate to provide choices in a limited range. Because the full range may not be visible all at once in a scrolling list, it's difficult for  
<span id="page-39-0"></span>users to understand the scope of their choices. Sliders work very well for displaying a limited range of values and letting users choose their preference in the range. See ["Sliders and Tick Marks" \(page 34\)](#page-33-0) for information about sliders.  
The **list box frame** is available as a separate control so that non-standard list boxes can be made Appearance-compliant.
