A user accesses system-wide preferences through the built-in Prefs application. Its main view lists preference categories, and tapping a category displays a slip containing relevant preference items. Your application can add categories and corresponding views that the Prefs application displays, but they must be for system-wide preferences rather than application-specific ones. Figure 8-26 shows the standard system-wide categories on a MessagePad 120.
