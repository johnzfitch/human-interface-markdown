If your app includes a sidebar (or source list), you may need to design icons to display in it. For example, Mail contains several icons that represent the user's mailboxes, VIPs, and archived messages.

Sidebar icons are small and streamlined, but they provide more internal detail and a more realistic outline than the icons that go inside of toolbar controls (to learn more about designing this type of toolbar control, see Create [Template](#page-324-0) Images to Put Inside Toolbar Controls (page 325)). To achieve the sidebar item look, try imagining an X-ray of the object you have in mind, then use transparency to capture the details.  
As with the template images that can be used inside toolbar controls, OS X applies various effects to sidebar icons. Follow these guidelines as you design your sidebar icons:  
- Use black combined with transparency (that is, alpha values) to suggest details.
- Make the outline sharp and clear.
- Use a straight-on perspective.  
- PDF format is recommended.
- Create your icons in three sizes: 16 x 16, 18 x 18, and 32 x 32 pixels (if using PDF).  
**Note:** When you're designing a sidebar icon, it's recommended that you use black, which makes it easier to discern details and outlines. However, you can use any color to create your icons, because the system ignores the color and pays attention only to the alpha values that you add.  
If you create your sidebar icons in PDF format, OS X automatically scales your icon for high-resolution displays, so you don't need to provide high-resolution versions. However, if you use PNG format for your icons, you need to supply the following resources: 16x16, 16x16@2x, 18x18, 18x18@2x, 32x32, and 32x32@2x. (PNG format isrecommended only for designsthat are very intricate and require effectslike shading, textures, and highlights.)
