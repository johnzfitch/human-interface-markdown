#### **Pointers**

Pointers on the screen assume different shapes, according to the context of the application, giving users additional feedback about their interactions with the computer (Table 2-1). The changing pointer is one of the few truly *modal* aspects of the Apple Desktop Interface: a given action may yield quite different results, depending on the shape of the pointer at the time. It is essential that the user can easily distinguish the different modes.

Three common pointer shapes are the arrow pointer, the I-beam, and the wristwatch.

The **arrow pointer** is the general-purpose pointer for selecting icons, pulling down menus, and choosing menu items.

To move the insertion point (the blinking vertical bar that shows the user where text can be entered), the user moves the **I-beam pointer** to the new location and clicks the mouse button. For the user, this is less awkward, more natural, and much faster than a cursor-based system. Unlike cursors moved by arrow keys, the insertion point is moved directly to a new location without intermediate states.

The wristwatch pointer indicates that user input is disabled while the computer is doing something that will take a few moments.
