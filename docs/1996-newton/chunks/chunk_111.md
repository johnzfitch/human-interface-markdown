The People picker is an overview picker that contains names of people and companies from the Names File and Owner Info applications. For each name, a People picker can also include a phone number, fax number, or e-mail address. The controls and behavior of a People picker are the same as any ordinary overview picker (see ["Overview Pickers" on page 4-19\)](#page-144-0). [Figure 4-21](#page-153-0) shows a sample People picker.
