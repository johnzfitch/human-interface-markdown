<span id="page-194-6"></span>The **tab view** provides a convenient way to present information in a multipane format. The tab control displays horizontally centered across the top edge of a content area.  
The content area below the control is called a **pane.** In a window with a tab view, you can use other controls, such as push buttons and text entry fields.The controls can be global—affecting the settings of all panes—or specific to an individual pane; make it clear through labeling and placement (within or outside of a pane's boundary) whether a control affects one pane or all panes.

A segmented control can provide a way to switch between panes. It looks similar to a tab view, but it is not attached to the panes. See ["Segmented Control"](#page-167-0) (page 168).

<span id="page-196-0"></span>Panes can extend from one edge of a window to the other, or they can be inset within a window. Figure 10-52 shows an example of panes that extend from one edge of a window to the other.

For inset tab panes, the recommended inset is 20 pixels on each side within a window, although 16 is also allowed. You can define a window so that space remains below the tab pane for global controls such as push buttons. Figure 10-53 shows an example of tab panes inset within a window, with buttons below the panes.
