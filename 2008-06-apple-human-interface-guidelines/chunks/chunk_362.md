**Control sizes**: The height of a pop-up menu is fixed for each size. The width should be wide enough to accommodate the longest item. If you display multiple pop-up menus in a stack the width of each control should be the same.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: The menu-item text in a pop-up menu should be in a font that is proportional to the size of the control. The text of the introductory label should be an emphasized version of the same font. Use the following metrics and specifications for a pop-up menu:  
#### ■ Regular size:  
- ❏ Menu-item text: System font. Leave 9 pixels from the left edge of the control and at least 9 pixels from the double-arrow area.
- ❏ Introductory text: Emphasized system font. Leave 8 pixels between the end of the text (colon) and the left edge of the control.  
#### ■ Small:  
- ❏ Menu-item text: Small system font. Leave 7 pixels from the left edge of the control and at least 7 pixels from the double-arrow area.
- ❏ Introductory text: Emphasized small system font. Leave 6 pixels between the end of the text (colon) and the left edge of the control.  
#### ■ Mini:  
- ❏ Menu-item text: Mini system font. Leave 5 pixels from the left edge of the control and at least 5 pixels from the double-arrow area.

**Control spacing**: When you display multiple pop-up menus stacked vertically, leave the following amounts of space between them (Figure 15-32 shows how this looks with regular-size controls):  
- Regular size: At least 10 pixels between stacked controls.
- Small: At least 8 pixels between stacked controls.
- Mini: At least 6 pixels between stacked controls.
