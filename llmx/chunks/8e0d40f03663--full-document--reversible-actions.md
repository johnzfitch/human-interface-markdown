#### Reversible Actions

Because the Apple Desktop Interface encourages exploration, users can very easily choose a path they didn't really intend to take. This is all right, unless the results are so unpleasant that users regret their exploration and hesitate to do it again. For this reason, almost everything the user does can be reversed. If a user starts to print a document, then decides against it, he can stop the printer. If a user moves an icon from one place to another, then decides it belongs somewhere else, she can move it again.

When users initiate operations that can't be reversed, the program should explicitly tell them that and give them the opportunity to back out. For example, if I indicate that I want to replace one document with another, ask me to confirm the request before it's carried out. When I quit working on a document, ask me if I want to incorporate the changes made since the last save.
