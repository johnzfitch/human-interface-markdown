A **picker** is a generic version of the date and time picker (see "Date and Time [Pickers"](#page-89-0) (page 90) for more information about this control). You can use a picker to display any set of values. As with a date and time picker, users spin the wheel (or wheels) of a picker until the desired value appears. Figure 9-7 shows a picker with a single wheel.

As you decide whether to use a picker in your application, consider that many, if not most, of the values in a wheel are hidden from the user when the wheel is stationary. This is not necessarily a problem, especially if users already know what those values are. For example, in a date and time picker, users understand that the hidden valuesin the month wheel can only be numbers between 1 and 12. If you need to provide choices that aren't members of such a well-known set, however, a picker might not be the appropriate control.  
If you need to display a very large number of values, you might want to list them in a table view instead of in a picker. This is because the greater height of a table view makes scrolling faster.  
If you need to provide context for a value in a picker, such as a unit of measurement, display it in the translucent selection bar horizontally across the center of the control. Do not display such labels above the picker or on the wheelsthemselves. For an example of the correct way to display labels,see the Timer function of the built-in Clock application, which displays "hours" and "mins" (or "min") next to the values users select.  
<span id="page-95-0"></span>As with a date and time picker, a generic picker can be visible all the time (as a focal point of your user interface) or it can appear only when needed. The overall size of a picker, including its background, is fixed, and is the same size as a keyboard.
