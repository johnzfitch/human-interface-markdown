Avoid making assumptions about display size. Mac OS X can run on systems with a screen size as small as 800 x 600, but a user may have multiple high-resolution displays. Unless you know that your users will be using a specific display size, it is best to optimize your applications for display at 1024 x 768 pixels.  
**Note:** A resolution of 640 x 480 is also available for the iBook and for Classic applications, games, and other multimedia applications. This does not mean that you should assume this is the minimum system resolution, however. Design your user interface for a resolution of at least 800 x 600.  
Be aware that users may have the ability to rotate their displays, so you should also avoid making assumptions about the aspectratio. Displayrotation reverses the aspectratio of the screen.For example, if a user's display is set to a screen resolution of 800 x 600 (an aspect ratio of 1.33:1), after rotation the screen resolution is 600 x 800 (an aspect ratio of .75:1).  
An application can get notified of some types of screen-update events by registering for a callback, such as CGDisplayReconfigurationCallBack. For more information on this and other callbacks, see *Quartz Display Services Reference*.
