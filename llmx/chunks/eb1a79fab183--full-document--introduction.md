# *Introduction*

This manual discusses the NeXTSTEpn. user interface from the programmer's point of view. It's meant to serve as a bridge between your experience as a user of NeXTSTEP and your experience writing applications for other users.

- It explains the user interface and introduces some of its rationale so that it will be easier for you to design your application.
- It gives guidelines that all applications should follow. When the interface to your application is consistent with other NeXTSTEP applications, users will find it more familiar, quicker to learn, and easier to use.

A version of this manual is available on-line through Digital LibrarianT '" (which is described in the *User's Guide).* Digital Librarian also contains Release Notes that provide last-minute information about the latest release of the software.
