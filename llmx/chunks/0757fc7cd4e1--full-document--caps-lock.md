#### Caps Lock

The Caps Lock key latches in the down position when pressed, and releases when pressed again. When down it gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys. Caps Lock has the same effect on alphabetic keys that the Shift key has, but Caps Lock has no effect on any other keys. In other words, even when Caps Lock is down, the user must press the Shift key to produce the uppercase characters (#, ?, and so on) on the nonalphabetic keys.
