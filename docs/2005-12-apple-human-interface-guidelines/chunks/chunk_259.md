<span id="page-200-3"></span>A **dialog** is a window designed to elicit a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog, for example—permit the user to provide many responses at one time.  
**Alerts** are dialogs that appear when the system or an application needs to communicate information to the user. Alerts provide messages about error conditions or warn users about potentially hazardous situations or actions.  
For information about using the keyboard to interact with dialogs, see ["Keyboard Focus and](#page-98-0) [Navigation"](#page-98-0) (page 99).  
For specific design information on how to lay out dialogs, see ["Layout Examples"](#page-282-0) (page 283).
