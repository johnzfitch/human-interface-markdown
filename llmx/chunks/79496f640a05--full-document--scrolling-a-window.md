## Scrolling a Window

People use scroll bars to change which part of a document is shown in a window. Only the active window can be scrolled. This section describes the appearance and behavior of scroll bars and their controls. Figure 5-27 shows a conceptual view of a document and the portion of it that appears in a window.
