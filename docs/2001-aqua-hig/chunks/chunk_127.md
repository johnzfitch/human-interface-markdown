Use **radio buttons** for a set of mutually exclusive, but related, choices. A set of radio buttons should contain at least two items and a maximum of about seven. (For more than seven items, consider using a pop-up menu.) A set of radio buttons is never dynamic (changing contents depending on the context). A radio button should never initiate an action.  
Use **checkboxes** to indicate one or more options that must be either on or off. Each checkbox label should clearly imply two opposite states so it's clear what happens when the box is checked or unchecked. If you can't find an unambiguous label, consider using radio buttons so you can clarify the states with two different labels.
