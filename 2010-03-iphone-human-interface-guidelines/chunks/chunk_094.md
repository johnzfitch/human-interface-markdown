Navigation Bars, Tab Bars, Toolbars, and the Status Bar  
If your application's tab bar contains more than five tabs, iPhone OS displays four of them in the tab bar and adds a More tab, as shown in [Figure](#page-73-2) 6-11 (page 74).  
<span id="page-74-0"></span>Users tap the More tab to see a list of additional tabs in a separate screen, as shown in Figure 6-13.

The More screen can also include an Edit button that users can tap to configure the tab bar so that it displays the tabs they use most often. For example, Figure 6-14 shows the Configure screen users see after they tap the Edit button in the iPod application's More screen.
