A **bottom bar** is a window-frame area that is below the window body. Bottom bars give users access to controls that directly affect the contents or organization of the window body.  
In general, controls in a bottom bar are frequently used, but are somewhat less important than controls in a toolbar. For example, the bottom-bar controls in iChat allow users to add buddies to the list and to text message, call, or video chat with a selected buddy, whereas the controls in the toolbar are focused on the user of the application. Figure 14-25 shows the iChat bottom bar.

#### Bottom Bar Appearance and Behavior  
Because a bottom bar is part of the window frame, it has the same gray gradient surface that is visible in the toolbar–title bar area.  
Bottom bars can contain either regular-size or small rectangular-style toolbar controls; bottom bars should not contain icon buttons, capsule-style toolbar controls, custom controls, or any standard Aqua controls. See ["Controls](#page-256-0) for Toolbars and Bottom Bars" (page 257) for more information about controls that are suitable for use in a bottom bar.  
**Important:** If you choose to use system-provided images in your bottom-bar controls, be sure to avoid redefining their meanings. For example, use the Quick Look symbol to mean "preview with Quick Look" only; don't use it to mean "magnify."  
At the top of Figure 14-26 you can see the Address Book bottom bar (which uses small controls) and below it you can see the iCal bottom bar (which uses regular-size controls).
