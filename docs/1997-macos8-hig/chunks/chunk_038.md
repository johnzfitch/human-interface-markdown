The **modeless dialog frame** is used in the content region of a modeless dialog box. It is a rectangle with a two-pixel-wide border which shares the inside lines of the document window. This control provides an Appearance-compliant way to distinguish modeless dialogs from other windows. The modeless dialog frame has active and inactive states.  
[Figure 2-44](#page-51-0) shows a modeless dialog frame in an active dialog box.
