Figure 16-11 shows a well designed panel with small controls.

<span id="page-344-1"></span>As you do when using regular-size controls, you should use the center-equalized approach to laying out small controls. This visually balanced layout can be seen in Figure 16-12.

Small controls, like regular-size controls,should be aligned vertically when stacked. In addition,similar controls should have consistent widths and be aligned with each other, as shown in Figure 16-13.

Consistent use of white space is as important in windows with small controls as it is in windows with regular-size controls. For example, in Figure 16-14, you can see:  
- Equal margins at the window sides and bottom edge (the window in Figure 16-14 uses 20-pixel margins in these areas). Note that if you use group boxes in a panel with small controls, a narrower margin (such as 10 pixels) is more suitable.
- Equal spacing between groups of controls (the window in Figure 16-14 uses 12 pixels in these areas).
- Equal spacing between section labels and the first control in the section (the window in Figure 16-14 uses 8 pixels between the label of a control section, such as "Icon labels," and the first control in that section).  
In addition, the panel shown in Figure 16-14 uses a 14-pixel margin between the title bar and the top item in the window. To save space while creating distinct sections of controls, the example window uses bold font to label each section, instead of using horizontal separators or group boxes.
