- Do your utility windows use the right window type (kFloatingWindowClass or NSPanel)?
- If a tool palette is present, is the selected symbol (icon, pattern, character, or drawing) highlighted?
- Do palettes provide tracking feedback when the mouse button is down? Does any change in selection in palettes occur only when the mouse button is released?
- If you use any small controls in a utility window, are all the controls in the window the small versions (that is, you haven't mixed standard size and small controls in the same window)?
