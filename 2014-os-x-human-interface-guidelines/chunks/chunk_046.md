After you define your audience, define and analyze the tasks that your users might perform. Discover the mental or conceptual model people associate with the task your product will help them perform. A mental model paints a picture of a task and defines expectations about the components of the task, the organization of those components, and the overall workflow.  
To help you discover the mental models people associate with your product's tasks, look at how they perform similar tasks without a computer. What terminology do they use? What concepts, objects, and gestures do your users associate with this task? Design your product to reflect these things, but don't insist on replicating each step a user might take when performing the task without a computer. Take advantage of the inherent strengths of the computing environment to make the whole process easier or more streamlined.
