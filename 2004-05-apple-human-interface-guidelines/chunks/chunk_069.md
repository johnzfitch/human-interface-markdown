<span id="page-59-1"></span>Some applications that represent objects, such as QuickTime Player and Calculator, are most easily recognized by the objects themselves. When creating icons for such applications, it's more aesthetically pleasing to create a simplified, idealized representation of the object, instead of using an actual screen shot of the software. Re-creating the object is particularly important when users could confuse the icon with the actual interface.

<span id="page-59-2"></span>These icons, many of which are a precursor of what you'll see when you open the application, use a straight-on perspective (rather than the "on a desktop" user application style). You never see the Calculator onscreen in three dimensions, for example, so its icon doesn't depict it that way.  
#### Utility Icons  
Icons for utility applications—which are used less often and not simply for fun or creative activities— convey a more serious tone than those for user applications. Color in these icons is desaturated, predominantly gray, and added only when necessary to clearly communicate what the applications do.

Because utility applications are normally focused on a narrow set of tasks, it's best to keep the number of elements in the icon to a minimum. The focus should be a single object that represents what the utility does. The perspective of utility icons is straight-on, as if they are on a shelf in front of you.
