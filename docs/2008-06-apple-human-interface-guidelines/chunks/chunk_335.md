**Control sizes**: The dimensions of bevel buttons vary; 20 x 20 pixels is the recommended size for use in a tool panel (see ["Panels"](#page-221-0) (page 222) for more information on panels).  
**Icon sizes**: 32 x 32 pixels is the largest recommended icon size. Maintain a margin of between 5 and 15 pixels between the icon and the outer edges of the button. A button that contains an icon and label combined may need a margin around the edge that's closer to 15 pixels than to 5 pixels.  
<span id="page-269-0"></span>**Control spacing**: For bevel buttons with rounded corners that contain a 24 x 24 pixel (or larger) icon, leave at least 8 pixels between buttons, stacked vertically or aligned horizontally. Otherwise, buttons should butt up against each other.  
Figure 15-18 shows some examples of these configurations.
