#### **Multiple-Clicking**

The user *double-clicks* an object by positioning the cursor over it, then quickly pressing and releasing a mouse button twice in succession. The mouse button must be pressed the second time within a short interval of the first, or the action will count as two successive clicks rather than a double-click. In addition, the cursor can't move significantly during the interval. This is to guarantee that the double-click remains focused on a single location on-screen.

With the Preferences application, users can set the maximum length of the time interval between clicks to suit their individual needs.

The user *triple-clicks* an object by rapidly pressing and releasing a mouse button three times in succession. The time interval between successive clicks and the distance the cursor can move between the first and the last click are subject to the same constraints that apply to a double-click.
