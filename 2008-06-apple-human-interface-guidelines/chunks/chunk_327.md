Use a gradient button when you need to offer functionality that is directly related to a source list or other view, such as a column view. Gradient buttons can have push-button, toggle, and pop-up menu behavior. For example, Mail uses gradient buttons at the bottom of the sidebar to offer New Mailbox, Show/Hide Mail Activity, and Action menu functionality, as shown in Figure 15-15.

Gradient buttons with toggle and pop-up menu behavior  
Gradient buttons do not belong in the window-frame areas. If you need to offer an Action menu or other functionality in a bottom bar, use a rectangular-style toolbar control instead (see ["Rectangular-Style](#page-249-0) Toolbar [Controls"](#page-249-0) (page 250) for more information).
