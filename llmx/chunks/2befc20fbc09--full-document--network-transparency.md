## Network Transparency

Most collaborative products are based on a number of sophisticated networking and communications technologies. The details of networking and data transport can be very complicated, technical, and often arcane. Ideally, make your product as self-configuring as possible so your users won't need to confront the technological details of the network. Also, try to make interacting with remote resources as simple as using local resources.

This chapter discusses aspects of the product development process, including ways you can incorporate human interface design into that process. First, this chapter presents several issues to consider when deciding on the features you want to include in your product. Second, this chapter provides suggestions for how to make your product simple and easy to use; too often, users are confused by unnecessary complexity in an application. Next, this chapter describes how to extend the interface when your application requires functionality that isn't covered by existing user interface elements. Finally, this chapter discusses the benefits of involving users throughout the entire phase of your product development process.
