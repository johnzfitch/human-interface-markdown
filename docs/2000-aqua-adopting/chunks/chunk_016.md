Push buttons have a fixed height of 20 pixels. They have fixed-sized end caps (14 pixels wide) that clip text if you don't specify a button that is wide enough to accommodate the text string. [Figure 1-7](#page-13-0) illustrates push button dimensions. If you need to use a font that is larger than the system font, use a bevel button instead of a push button.

If stacked vertically the space should be10 pixels high.  
[Figure 1-8](#page-14-0) shows the dimensions of the small version of push buttons. For information on when to use the small version, see ["Using Small Versions of](#page-12-0)  [Controls" \(page 13\)](#page-12-0).

Non adjustable end caps should be 10 pixels.  
The standard width for OK and Cancel buttons is 69 pixels, as shown in [Figure 1-9](#page-14-1). Push buttons used in other contexts may be sized differently if appropriate.

**Note:** All push buttons are clear except the default button (the button selected by pressing the Return key), which uses the default color (in addition to pulsing). For example, in a dialog containing a default OK button and a Cancel button, the Cancel button is clear and the OK button uses color and pulses. When the user presses a nondefault button such as Cancel, the button acquires color and the default button loses its coloring. [Figure 1-2](#page-5-0) shows an example of a default button that uses color.
