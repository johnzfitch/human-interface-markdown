Menus provide users a point of entry for all the functionality of an application, its obscure and common features alike. Because of this special role, they behave in a special way:  
- All the visible menus for an application disappear when the user starts working in another application. They reappear when the user returns to the application. (Menus that weren't previously on-screen don't reappear.)
- Menus are segregated into two of the frontmost tiers of on-screen windows. They appear to float above everything else on-screen except attention panels and spring-loaded windows such as pop-up lists.
- Menus can't be miniaturized. They don't need to be, since they're small and can be easily retrieved after they've been closed.
- Menus are hierarchically arranged. Choosing a command in one menu can produce another menu with its own list of commands.  
The first three of these points were discussed earlier in this manual. (See "The Active Application," "Window Order," and "Miniaturizing" in Chapter 4, "The Window Interface to Applications.")  
Applications should make use of the menu system's hierarchy to arrange commands in distinct, functionally identifiable menus. A well-defined set of hierarchical menus aids users both in finding the commands they need and in understanding the structure of the application.  
#### **How Menus Work**  
![](images/_page_112_Picture_1.jpeg)  
The main purpose of menus is to provide commands for the user to choose. To choose a menu command, the user presses the mouse button as the cursor points anywhere within the content area of the menu and releases it as the cursor points to the desired command. This can be as simple as clicking the command, or the user can drag through the menu, from command to command. Each command that comes under the cursor while the mouse button is down is highlighted.  
Instead of using the mouse, the user can often use a keyboard alternative to choose a command. A keyboard alternative is a combination of a character and the Command key. For example, holding down the Command key and pressing the **p** key is the standard keyboard alternative for the Print command. Keyboard alternatives are discussed in detail in Chapter 3, "User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse."  
#### The Main Menu  
Every NeXTSTEP application has at least one menu, its main menu. If an application has just a main menu, it holds all the commands for the application. If the application has more than one menu, all but the main menu are submenus of another menu. Through the hierarchical arrangement of submenus, the main menu gives the user access to all the menus of the application.  
Because the main menu is at the top of the menu hierarchy, it lacks a close button and always remains on-screen when its application is active.  
By default, when an application first starts up, its main menu appears in the upper left corner of the screen. Users can change this default location by dragging the main menu to a new position. Another way to change the default location for all applications (except those whose main menus have already been moved) is with the Preferences application.
