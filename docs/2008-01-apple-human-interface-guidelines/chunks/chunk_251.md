**Control sizes**: The round rectangle scope button is available in regular, small, and mini sizes. The height of the control is fixed for each size, but you set the width.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: If you choose to use text to label scope buttons, use the view font (12-point Lucida Grande). Use the view font in bold for recessed scope buttons and the regular view font for round rectangle scope buttons.  
#### Scope Button Implementation  
Scope buttons are available in Interface Builder. You can also use Application Kit programming interfaces to create them. To create a recessed scope button, use the setBezelStyle: method of NSButtonCell with NSRecessedBezelStyle as the argument. To create a round rectangle scope button, pass NSRoundRectBezelStyle as the argument to the setBezelStyle: method.
