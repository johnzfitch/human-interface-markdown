Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some apps attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. Because this approach puts the computer, not the user, in control, it is best confined to parts of the user interface aimed at novice users. Provide the level of user control that is appropriate for your audience.

For example, in situations where the user might destroy data accidentally, you should always provide a warning, but allow the user to proceed if they choose.
