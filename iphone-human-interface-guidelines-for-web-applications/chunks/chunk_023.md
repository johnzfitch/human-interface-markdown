This chapter provides specific layout guidelines and metrics you can use to design the user interface of your web content so it looks great and works well on iPhone OS–based devices. Some guidelines and metrics are more applicable to iPhone web applications than to webpages, but you should read them all and follow the ones that make the most sense for your needs.  
If you're new to web content design, be sure to familiarize yourself with accepted best practices; for an overview, see Creating Compatible Web Content. Then, read this chapter to find out how to adjust your content so it works well with the unique features of iPhone.  
**Note:** This chapter describes metrics and other specifics you need when you create web content "by hand" for display on iPhone OS–based devices. As an alternative, you might choose to take advantage of the comprehensive and intuitive web application development environment in Dashcode 2.0. To learn more about the facilities Dashcode provides, see *Dashcode User Guide*.
