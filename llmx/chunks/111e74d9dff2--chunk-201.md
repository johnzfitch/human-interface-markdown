If you use color to code categories of information in your application, try to limit the use of color elsewhere in the application. Using color to code categories—for example, to label or distinguish groups of items—can make information clear. Providing the user with a small initial selection of distinct colors—for example, from four to seven—and with the capability to change those colors or add more is the best solution.

This chapter describes the aspects of the Macintosh interface that are essential to its "feel." It covers the interaction between the user and the computer, detailing how the computer should respond. This chapter contains information about the mouse and the pointer, the keyboard, and the behavior of different types of objects such as text, graphics, and arrays. It discusses the behaviors associated with the primary user input devices—the mouse and keyboard. It also describes responses generated by your application, such as selection behavior and keyboard navigation through lists.
