To determine the proper use of colons in item labels, see *Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines*.  
There are three approaches you can take to aligning static text fields when you stack multiple dialog box items to which the fields pertain:  
- <span id="page-84-0"></span>■ You can left align the text fields. This is the standard approach.
- You can right align the text fields. This is useful when you use colons at the end of the field. Figure 3-33 shows this approach.

■ A third approach—left aligning both the text fields and their items—is useful for the rare case in which the fields are nearly the same length. If you are designing your application and its interface for the international market, you should not take this approach because it does not lend itself to localization.  
Leave 6 pixels of space between the baseline of text fields and dialog box items that appear below them, as shown in Figure 3-34. This measurement allows space for a keyboard focus ring.
