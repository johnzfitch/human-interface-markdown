#### **Human Tasks**

Not very long ago, most personal computer users were also programmers. In fact, many of them were computer builders as well, because personal computers were available only as kits. Today, most personal computers are seen as *tools* that magnify a person's ability to perform all kinds of tasks that formerly were done without computers. The Apple Desktop Interface provides an environment in which people can perform their many tasks in a consistent and familiar computer environment—one that supports these human tasks. *Tasks* are critical. Ideally, the computer supports the performance of tasks without being a separate focus for the user's attention.

The desktop interface is optimized for non-programmers, for people involved in tasks other than strictly computer tasks, but it is not *just* for them. In fact, much of the early development of computer interfaces was aimed at enhancing the programmer's working environment (it was once thought that *everyone* should program). But even programmers often have non-programming tasks, and the interface also serves them well. It is a *human* interface, for non-computer human tasks.
