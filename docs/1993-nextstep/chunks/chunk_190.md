#### *inspector panel*  
A panel that displays information about the object that's currently selected.  
#### *Interface BuilderTlA*  
A tool that lets you graphically specify your application's user interface. It sets up the corresponding objects for you and makes it easy for you to establish connections between these objects and your own code where needed.  
#### *key-down event*  
An event that occurs when the user generates a character by pressing a key. Holding the key down generates subsequent key-down events at regular intervals.  
#### *key equivalent*

#### *key window*  
The window in the active application that receives keyboard events. The title bar of the key window is highlighted in black.  
#### *keyboard alternative*  
A way of using the keyboard, rather than the mouse, to choose a menu command, operate a button in a panel, or pick an item from a pop-up or pull-down list. While holding a Command key down, the user types a character associated with the command, button, or item. See also *key equivalent.*  
#### *knob*

#### *method*  
In object-oriented programming, a procedure that can be executed by an object.  
#### *miniaturize button*  
The button that can appear at the far left in a window's title bar. Clicking the button removes the window from the screen and replaces it with its miniwindow counterpart.  
#### *miniwindow*  
A small, icon-sized window that stands in for a window that has been miniaturized. Double-clicking the mini window reverses the miniaturization, returning the full window to the screen.

#### *mouse-dragged event*  
An event that occurs when the user moves the mouse while holding down a mouse button. There's one type of mouse-dragged event for when the mouse is moved with the left (or only) mouse button down, or with both buttons down, and another type for when it's moved with the right button down.  
#### *mouse-moved event*  
An event that occurs when the user moves the mouse without holding down a mouse button.  
#### *mouse scaling*  
The responsiveness of the cursor to movements of the mouse. Usually, the faster the mouse is moved, the farther the cursor travels.

An event that occurs when the user releases a mouse button. There's one type of mouse-up event for the left (or only) mouse button and one for the right button.  
#### *multiform panel*  
A panel that has a pop-up list or set of graphical radio buttons at the top that lets the user choose which form the panel takes.  
#### *multitasking*

#### *NeXTSTEpn.*  
NeXT's application development and user environment, consisting of the Workspace Manager, various applications such as Project Builder and Interface Builder, various software kits such as the Application Kit and the Database Kit, and the Window Server.  
#### *object*  
A programming unit that groups together a data structure (instance variables) and the operations (methods) that can use or affect that data; the central focus of object-oriented programming.  
#### *one-state button*  
A button that initiates actions, as opposed to one that sets a state. Also known as an action button. See also *two-state button.*  
#### *ordinary panel*  
Any panel that isn't an attention panel. See also *attention panel* and *panel.*  
#### *panel*  
A window that holds objects that control what happens in other windows (such as a Font panel) or in the application generally (such as a Preferences panel), or a window that presents information about the application to the user (such as an information panel).

#### *press*  
To press a mouse button and keep it down for a period of time while the cursor is positioned over an object on-screen. Pressing an on-screen object (such as a scroll button) may cause it to take repeated action, or may produce another object (such as a pop-up list) that the user can drag into.

#### *tear off*  
To drag an attached submenu away from its supermenu. Tearing off a submenu detaches it from its supermenu and gives it an independent life on-screen. Tom-off menus are the only menus with close buttons.  
#### *tiers*  
The sections of the screen list. Each tier is occupied by a different type of window, with spring-loaded windows such as pop-up lists in the frontmost tier, attention panels in the second tier, menus in the next two tiers, docked icons in the tier below menus, and floating panels below docked icons. All other windows are in the bottom tier.  
#### *triple-click*
