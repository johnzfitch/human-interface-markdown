If your application provides a number of actions users can take in the current context, it might be appropriate to provide a toolbar. A toolbar appears at the bottom edge of the screen and contains buttons that perform actions related to objects in the current view. A toolbar should not be used to switch among different modes in an application; if you need to do this, use a tab bar instead (see "Tab [Bars"](#page-64-0) (page 65) for more information).  
For example, when users view a message in Mail, the application provides a toolbar that contains items for deleting, replying to, and moving the message, in addition to checking for new mail and composing a new message. In this way, users can stay within the message-viewing context and still have accessto the commands they need to manage their email. Figure 6-7 shows what this looks like.

It's a good idea to constrain the number of items you display in a toolbar, so users can easily tap the one they want. Remember that the hit-region of a user interface element is recommended to be 44 x 44 pixels, so providing five or fewer toolbar items is reasonable. Figure 6-8 shows an example of appropriate spacing of toolbar items in a toolbar.

The items in both [Figure](#page-64-1) 6-7 (page 65) and Figure 6-8 do not include a bezel. In iPhone OS this style is called the plain style. (For an example of the bordered style, look at the buttons in [Figure](#page-63-1) 6-6 (page 64).) Although you can use either the bordered or plain style for buttons in a toolbar, you should not mix both styles in the same toolbar.  
<span id="page-64-0"></span>You can design your own icons for use in toolbar buttons, or you can take advantage of the predefined buttons iPhone OS provides. (See "Standard Buttons for Use in Toolbars and [Navigation](#page-105-0) Bars" (page 106) for more information on the buttons available to you.) If you choose to create custom toolbar buttons, be sure to make them as similar in size as possible to achieve a balanced, attractive appearance.
