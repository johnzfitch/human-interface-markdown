This section is specific to the Macintosh family of computers. For full details, see Inside Macintosh.  
The Macintosh Resource Manager allows the separation of code and data. Data (in the form of resources) can be edited with a number of tools such as REdit and ResEdit. Changing the appropriate resources lets you change the appearance of an application (dialog boxes, messages, menus, and so on) without rebuilding the application code. Always use the Macintosh's international resources where applicable.
