An action sheet has two different appearances. On iPhone, an action sheet always emerges from the bottom of the screen and hovers over the application's views. The side edges of an action sheet are anchored to the sides of the screen, which reinforces its connection to the app and to the user's most recent action.  
On iPad, an action sheet is always displayed within a popover; it never has full-screen width. An action sheet can cause a popover to appear, or it can appear within a popover that is already open. In both cases, there is a strong visual connection between the action sheet and the user's action. (To learn more about popovers, see ["Popover](#page-102-1) (iPad Only)" (page 103).)  
An action sheet always contains at least two buttons that allow users to choose how to complete their task. When users tap a button, the action sheet disappears. An action sheet does not include a title or explanatory text, because it appears in immediate response to a user action.
