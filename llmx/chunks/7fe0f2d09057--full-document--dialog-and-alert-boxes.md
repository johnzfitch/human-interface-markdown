#### Dialog and alert boxes

Except for dialog boxes used to select colors, there's no reason to color the controls or text in dialog boxes; they should be designed and laid out clearly enough that color isn't necessary to separate different sections or items. Alert boxes must be as clear as possible; color can add confusion instead of clarity. For example, if you tried to make things clearer by using red to mean dangerous and green to mean safe in the Erase Disk alert box, the OK button—"go"—would be red and the Cancel button—"stop"—would be green. Don't do this.
