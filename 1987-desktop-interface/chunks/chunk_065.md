To choose a menu item, the user positions the pointer over the menu's title in the menu bar, and presses the mouse button. The application highlights the title and displays the menu.  
While holding down the mouse button, the user drags the pointer through the menu. Each menu item is highlighted in turn. When the user releases the mouse button, the operation that's highlighted is chosen. As soon as the mouse button is released, the menu item blinks briefly, the menu disappears, and the operation is executed. The menu title in the menu bar remains highlighted until the operation is completed.  
Nothing actually happens until the user chooses the operation. The user can *look* at any of the menus without making a commitment to do anything. The user can also move the pointer all over the screen (except back into the menu bar) without losing sight of the menu, as long as the mouse button is pressed. To close a pull-down menu without choosing an operation, the user simply returns the pointer to the menu bar or moves it away from the menu, then releases the button.
