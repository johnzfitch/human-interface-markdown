<span id="page-220-4"></span><span id="page-220-2"></span>The principle driving these drag-and-drop guidelines is to prevent the user from accidental data loss. Moving data across applications may result in potential data loss because an Undo command in the destination application does not trigger an Undo in the source application. Moving data within the same window (or same volume, as in the case of the Finder) does not lead to data loss.
