When pressed at the same time as a character key, the Shift key produces the uppercase alphabetic letter or the upper symbol on the key.  
The Shift key is also used with the mouse for extending a selection or for constraining movements in graphics applications. For example, in some applications pressing Shift while using a rectangle tool draws squares.
