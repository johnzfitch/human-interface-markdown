To ensure that your content is readable and well laid out when it displays on iPhone, you can provide a style sheet that adapts to iPhone. For example, you might want to do this if your text looks better in Safari on iPhone when it is displayed at 200%. Or, you might change the display of a set of items from a horizontal orientation to a vertical one, to accommodate the smaller screen.  
<span id="page-31-3"></span>You can also use custom CSS to style controls or provide alternative controls. For example, the Apple website includes a page that displays movie trailers users can watch. When viewed in Safari on the desktop, users can click the numbers or the previous and next controls (shown in Figure 4-3) to see additional trailers.

When viewed on iPhone, however, the next, previous, and number controls are replaced by prominent, easy-to-use buttons with symbols that echo the style of built-in controls. Figure 4-4 shows one of these custom controls.

To provide a style sheet specifically for iPhone, use the CSS 3 media query. For more information on how to do this, including code samples, see Customizing Style Sheets.
