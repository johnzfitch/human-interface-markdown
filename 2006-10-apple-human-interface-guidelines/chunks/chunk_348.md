There is a difference of three pixels in the vertical spacing of tab views between Carbon and Cocoa windows when you follow the blue Aqua guides in Interface Builder. This is because the Aqua guide is measured from a clippingline that is different in the two types ofwindow. Because most developers do not mix Carbon and Cocoa windows in the same application, this does not cause problems. You should still follow the Aqua guides when you use Interface Builder to design your user interface.  
[Figure](#page-281-0) 14-64 (page 282) shows the difference in vertical space. In both windows, the pop-up menu is placed according to the blue Aqua guide, which measures 20 pixels below the clipping line.
