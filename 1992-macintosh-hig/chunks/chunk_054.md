When people work in groups, sharing information among computers over networks, usually one person controls some resource that other people are using simultaneously. A **shared resource** may be a document with data in it, an application, a storage medium, or some other resource. The user in control of the shared resource needs to be aware of the consequences to other current users, particularly in situations in which the user in control wants to cease sharing or disconnect other users from the shared resource. Create a structure that allows clear communication about the shared resource between the users in a group.
