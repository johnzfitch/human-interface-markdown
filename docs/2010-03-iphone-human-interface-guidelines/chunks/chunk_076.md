Here are some scenarios that illustrate how to choose the audio session category that provides an audio experience users appreciate.  
**Scenario 1**. Imagine that you're developing an educational application that helps people learn a new language. You provide feedback soundsthat play when userstap specific controls and recordings of words and phrases that play when users want to hear examples of correct pronunciation.  
In this application, sound is essential to the primary functionality. People use this application to hear words and phrases in the language they're learning, so the sound should play even when the Ring/Silent switch is set to silent or the device locks. Because users need to hear the sounds clearly, they expect other audio they might be playing to be silenced.  
To produce the audio experience users expect for this application, you would use the Playback category. Although this category can be refined to allow mixing with other audio (as described in [Table](#page-56-1) 4-1 (page 57)), this application should use the default behavior to ensure that other audio does not compete with the educational content the user has explicitly chosen to hear.
