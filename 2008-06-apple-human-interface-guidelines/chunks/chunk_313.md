A push button always contains text, it does not contain an image. If you need to display an icon or other image on a button, use instead a bevel button, described in "Bevel [Buttons"](#page-268-0) (page 269).  
The label on a push button should be a verb or verb phrase that describes the action it performs—Save, Close, Print, Delete, Change Password, and so on. If a push button acts on a single setting, label the button asspecifically as possible; "Choose Picture…," for example, is more helpful than "Choose…" Because buttons initiate an immediate action, it shouldn't be necessary to use "now" (Scan Now, for example) in the label.  
Push button labels should have title-style capitalization, as described in ["Capitalization](#page-130-1) of Interface Element [Labels](#page-130-1) and Text" (page 131). If the push button immediately opens another window, dialog, or application to perform its action, you can use an ellipsisin the label. For example, Mail preferences displays a push button that includes an ellipsis because it opens .Mac system preferences, as shown in Figure 15-8.

<span id="page-259-1"></span>All push buttons should be clear in appearance, that is, without color, except the default button. The default button is the button that performs a safe action in a dialog and is activated when the user presses Return or Enter (for more information about the default button, see ["Dismissing](#page-235-1) Dialogs" (page 236)). When the user presses a nondefault button, such as Cancel, that button acquires color and the default button loses its color. If you use system-provided push buttons, this behavior is automatic.
