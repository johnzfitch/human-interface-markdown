# Opening and Closing Windows

Windows come up onto the screen in different ways as appropriate to the purpose of the window. The application controls at least the initial size and placement of its windows.

Most windows have a close box that, when clicked, makes the window go away. The application in control of the window determines what's done with the window visually and logically when the close box is clicked. Visually, the window can either shrink to a smaller object such as an icon, or leave no trace behind when it closes. Logically, the information in the window is either retained and then restored when the window is reopened (which is the usual case), or else the window is reinitialized each time it's opened. When a document is closed, the user is given the choice whether to save any changes made to the document since the last time it was saved.

If an application doesn't support closing a window with a close box, it should not include a close box on the window.
