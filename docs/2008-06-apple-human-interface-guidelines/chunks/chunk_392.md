**Control sizes**: Linear sliders are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. Circular sliders are available in regular and small sizes. The dimensions of sliders are fixed for each size and type, but the inclusion of tick marks changes the effective size of the control. These measurements are stated below to help you with your layout.  
Height of horizontally positioned linear sliders:  
- Regular size, directional thumb: 19 pixels without tick marks, 25 pixels with tick marks.
- Regular size, round thumb: 15 pixels.
- Small, directional thumb: 14 pixels without tick marks, 19 pixels with tick marks.
- Small, round thumb: 12 pixels.
- Mini, directional thumb: 11 pixels without tick marks, 17 pixels with tick marks.
- Mini, round thumb: 10 pixels.  
Width of vertically positioned linear sliders:  
- Regular size, directional thumb: 18 pixels without tick marks, 24 pixels with tick marks.
- Regular size, round thumb: 15 pixels.
- Small, directional thumb: 14 pixels without tick marks, 19 pixels with tick marks.
- Small, round thumb: 11 pixels.
- Mini, directional thumb: 11 pixels without tick marks, 17 pixels with tick marks.
- Mini, round thumb: 10 pixels.  
Diameter of circular sliders:  
- Regular size with tick marks: 32 pixels.
- Regular size without tick marks: 24 pixels.  
- Small with tick marks: 22 pixels.
- Small without tick marks: 18 pixels.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: For the labels that describe the range of values, use the following font sizes:  
- Regular size: Label font.
- Small: Label font.
- Mini: 9-point label font.  
**Control spacing**: When you display multiple linear sliders, leave the following amounts of space between them:  
- <span id="page-299-3"></span>■ Regular size: At least 12 pixels.
- Small: At least 10 pixels.
- Mini: At least 8 pixels.
