Dragging items to the Trash results in moving the item from the source to the Trash. For example, dragging a text selection from a word-processing application and dropping it on the Trash icon (or in the Trash window) results in the text being deleted from the application and a clipping containing that text being created inside the Trash. Note that the item is moved, although it is dragged between two containers. This exception to the rules described earlier is appropriate because the user can undo the operation by draggingthe clippingout of the Trash backto its original source; it is consistentwith the principle of preventing accidental data loss.  
It is important to preserve the Trash's container property; do not simply delete the source without creating a clipping or other item in the Trash.
