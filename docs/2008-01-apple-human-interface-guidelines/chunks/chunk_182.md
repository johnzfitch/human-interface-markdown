Menu item names should be either actions performed on an object or attributes applied to an object:  
- <span id="page-167-1"></span>■ Actions are verbs or verb phrases that declare the action that occurs when the user chooses the item. For example, Save means *save my file* and Copy means *copy the selected data.* Your action menu commands should begin in the same way, with an action verb in its base (simplest) form.
- Attributes are adjectives or adjective phrases that describe the change the command implements. Adjectives in menus *imply* an action and should fit into the sentence "Change the selected object to …" —for example, *Bold* or *Italic*.  
<span id="page-167-2"></span>When a menu item is unavailable—because it doesn't apply to the selected object or to the selected object in its current state, or because nothingis selected, for example—the item should appear dimmed (gray) in the menu and is not highlighted when the user moves the pointer over it.  
Use title-style capitalization in your menus. See ["Capitalization](#page-135-0) of Interface Element Labels and [Text"](#page-135-0) (page 136) for more information on this style.  
<span id="page-167-3"></span>An **ellipsis character**(…) after a menu item indicates to the userthat additional information is required to complete a command. For information on when to use an ellipsis in menu items, see ["Using](#page-130-1) the Ellipsis [Character"](#page-130-1) (page 131).  
<span id="page-167-0"></span>It may be appropriate in some cases to provide **dynamic menu items**—commands that change when the user presses a modifier key. For example, if the user opens the Window menu in the Finder and then presses the Option key, some of the menu items change, as shown in Figure 13-4. The system appropriately sizes the menu to hold the widest item, including Option-enabled commands.

Dynamic menu items are an appropriate way to offer a shortcut to sophisticated users. However, because dynamic menu items are hidden by default, theyshould never be the onlywayto accomplish a task. Be sure that you don't require users to discover a dynamic menu item before they can use your  
application effectively. To return to the example of the Minimize menu items in the Finder Window menu (shown in Figure 13-4), note that a user who hasn't discovered the Minimize All command can still minimize all open Finder windows by minimizing each one individually.  
If you decide to offer a dynamic menu item, be sure to require only a single modifier key to reveal it. Requiring more than one additional key press to reveal a dynamic menu item can make it physically awkward for the user and greatly decreases the user's chances of discovering the key combination.  
You can use Interface Builder to define dynamic menu items. You can also do so using Application Kit programming interfaces. Specifically, you can use the setAlternate: method of NSMenuItem to designate one menu item as the alternate of another.
