iOS 7 embodies the following themes:  
- **Deference.** The UI helps users understand and interact with the content, but never competes with it.
- **Clarity.** Text is legible at every size, icons are precise and lucid, adornments are subtle and appropriate, and a sharpened focus on functionality motivates the design.
- **Depth.** Visual layers and realistic motion impart vitality and heighten users' delight and understanding.

Whether you're redesigning an existing app or creating a new one, consider approaching the job in the way that Apple approached the redesign of the built-in apps:  
- First, strip away the UI to expose the app's core functionality and reaffirm its relevance.
- Next, use the themes of iOS 7 to inform the design of the UI and the user experience. Restore details and embellishments with care and never gratuitously.  
● Throughout, be prepared to defy precedent, question assumptions, and let a focus on content and functionality motivate every design decision.
