On Newton devices that can change the orientation of the display, the Rotate button enables users to control which way the display faces. The effect of tapping a Rotate button depends on the number of available orientations. If a device has two orientations—regular and sideways like a MessagePad 120 then tapping a Rotate button changes between the two orientations. If a device has more than two orientations, then tapping a Rotate button presents a list of possible orientations. [Figure 3-33](#page-124-0) illustrates a Rotate button on a MessagePad 120.

<span id="page-126-0"></span>A **picker** is a black-bordered, unmovable view that pops up in response to a user action, such as tapping a button, label, or hot spot. A picker contains a set of items such as commands, attributes, states, or application data. The items may be presented as a simple list, a table with rows and columns, a numerical counter, or a calendar, and those formats can be mixed in a single picker. Users can choose an item or merely browse the picker. Most pickers close immediately when a user chooses an item, but the more elaborate pickers have a Close box that a user taps after choosing an item. Also, most types of pickers close if a user taps outside them.  
This chapter details the appearance and behavior of the following types of Newton pickers:  
- List pickers
- Number pickers
- Date and time pickers
- Data overview pickers  
This chapter ends with brief descriptions of prefabricated Newton pickers that pop up in many applications: the Info, New, Show, Action, and People pickers.
