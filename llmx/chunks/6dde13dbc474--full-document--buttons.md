## Buttons

A **button** is a rounded rectangle that is named with text. Clicking a button performs the action described by the button's name. Buttons usually perform instantaneous actions, such as completing operations defined by a dialog box or acknowledging an error message. A button's width is sized to fit the name it surrounds; the standard width for OK and Cancel buttons is 59 pixels.

Standard button height is 20 pixels. Figure 7-1 shows some typical buttons in a dialog box.
