CODE pressed with a key looks up that key in the abbreviation folder and acts as if the expansion of that abbreviation were pasted from the Scrap (see Section 12). For unformatted text, it is the same as typing that text in full.  
Certain CODE combinations are reserved, namely:  
```
CODE - ... ~ CODE | ... ~ {
CODE | ... | {
CODE | ... | }
CODE | ... | {
CODE | ... | }
```
