Good design must communicate, not just dazzle. It must inform, not just impress.  
The services of a skilled graphic designer are worth the expense.  
The real point of graphic design, which comprises both pictures and text, is clear communication. In the Apple Desktop Interface, everything the user sees and manipulates on the screen is graphic. As much as possible, all commands, features, and parameters of an application, and all the user's data, appear as graphic objects on the screen.  
Graphics are not merely cosmetic. When they are clear and consistent, they contribute greatly to ease of learning, communication, and understanding. The success of graphic design is measured in terms of the user's satisfaction and success in understanding the interface.  
If you design your icons and other graphics on the target screen, rather than on paper, you'll take advantage of whatever that screen has to offer and you'll have the best design possible. Not all screens are alike: for example, a Macintosh has approximately square pixels that are either black or white. Apple II pixels aren't square, and can be any of many different colors.
