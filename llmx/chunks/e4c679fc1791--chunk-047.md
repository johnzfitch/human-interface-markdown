Figure 1. Ways of Structuring Information  
Text can be arranged in a variety of ways on the screen. Some applications, such as word processors, might consist of nothing but text, while others, such as graphics-oriented applications, use text almost incidentally. It's useful to consider all the text appearing together in a particular context as a block of text. The size of the block can range from a single field, as in a dialog box, to the whole document, as in a word processor. Regardless of its size or arrangement, the application sees each block as a one-dimensional string of characters. Text is edited the same way regardless of where

it appears.  
Graphics are pictures, drawn either by the user or by the application. Graphics in a document tend to consist of discrete objects, which can be selected individually. Graphics are discussed further below, under "Using Graphics".  
Arrays are one— or two-dimensional arrangements of fields. If the array is one-dimensional, it's called a form; if it's two-dimensional it's called a table. Each field, in turn, contains a collection of information, usually text, but conceivably graphics. A table can be readily identified on the screen, since it consists of rows and columns of fields (often called cells), separated in graphics environments by horizontal and vertical lines. A form is something you fill out, like a credit-card application. A form may not be as obvious to the user as a table, since the fields can be arranged in any appropriate way. Nevertheless, the application regards the fields as in a definite linear order.  
Each of these three ways of presenting information retains its integrity, regardless of the context in which it appears. For example, a field in an array can contain text. When the user is manipulating the field as a whole, the field is treated as part of the array. When the user wants to change the contents of the field, the contents are edited in the same way as any other text.  
Another case is text that appears in a graphics application. Depending on the circumstances, the text can be treated as text or as graphics. In MousePaint, for example, the way text is treated depends on which palette symbol is in effect. If the text symbol is in effect, text can be edited in the usual way, but cannot be moved around on the screen. If the selecting arrow is in effect, a block of text can be moved around, but it cannot be edited.
