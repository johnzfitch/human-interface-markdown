The user moves a window by dragging its title bar or, for brushed metal windows, anywhere on the border. As a user drags, the full window and its contents move.  
Pressing the Command key while dragging an inactive window moves the window but does not make it active.  
Your application should never allow users to move a window to a position from which they can't reposition it.
