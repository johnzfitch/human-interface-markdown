You can use a split view to display persistent information in the left pane and related details or subordinate information in the right pane. In this design pattern, when people select an item in the left pane, the right pane should display the information related to that item. (You're responsible for making this happen in code.)  
In general, when an app uses a split view in landscape, it displays the contents of the left pane in a popover when it rotates to portrait. However, you are not required to follow this pattern. If it makes sense in your app, you can design your UI to display side-by-side views in all orientations.  
**Avoid creating a right pane that is narrower than the left pane**. Although the width of the right pane is up to you, it does not look good to use a width of less than 320 points (which is the width of the left pane).  
**Avoid displaying a navigation bar in both panes at the same time**. Doing this would make it very difficult for users to discern the relationship between the two panes.  
<span id="page-106-0"></span>**In general, indicate the current selection in the left pane in a persistent way**. This behavior helps people understand the relationship between the item in the left pane and the contents of the right pane. This is important because the content of the right pane can change, but it should always remain related to the item selected in the left pane.
