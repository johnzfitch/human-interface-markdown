You may choose to provide an Apply button in a dialog that displays multiple settings that affect the user's viewof data. An Applybutton should allowa user to previewthe effect of the selected settings without committing to the changes. Be cautious about using an Apply button for operations that take a long time to implement or undo; it might not be obvious to users that they can interrupt or reverse the process. Save dialogs or dialogs that allow users to make changes that can't be previewed easily should not include an Apply button.  
Clickingthe Applybutton does not dismiss the dialogbecause the user must decidewhetherto accept the previewed changes (by clicking OK) or to reject them (by clicking Cancel). Do not use the Apply button as another OK button—when the user dismisses the dialogwithout clicking OK, all previewed changes should be discarded.
