### **Dragging to Select**

Dragging selects everything in the range defined by the anchor point (where the cursor was located when the mouse button was pressed) and the end point (the cursor's location when the mouse button is released).

What "everything in the range" means depends on the type of material selected, as described in "The Range that Dragging Should Select," later in this chapter.
