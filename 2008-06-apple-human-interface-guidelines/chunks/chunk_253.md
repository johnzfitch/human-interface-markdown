A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (show or hide) while the parent window is open. A drawer should contain frequently accessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. For example, Figure 14-28 shows a drawer that provides details about slide builds in the Keynote Build inspector.
