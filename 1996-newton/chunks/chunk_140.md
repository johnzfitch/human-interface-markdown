The Newton operating system is able to recognize handwriting, printing, and drawing, transforming it into typeset, editable text or editable geometric shapes. The Newton system can also recognize a common set of pen gestures for correcting and editing input. The recognition system has a sophisticated multiple-recognizer architecture. There are separate recognizers for words, geometric shapes, and gestures, any of which an application can make simultaneously active. An arbitrator in the recognition system examines the results from simultaneously active recognizers and returns the recognition match that has the highest confidence.  
The text recognizers can handle printed, cursive, or mixed handwriting. They can work together with built-in dictionaries to choose words that accurately match what a user has written, and they can recognize a user's writing letter by letter. A user can also add new words to a personal dictionary.  
The shape recognizer recognizes both simple and complex geometric objects, cleaning up rough drawings into shapes with straight lines and smooth curves. The shape recognizer also recognizes symmetry, using that property, if present, to help it recognize and display objects.  
<span id="page-183-0"></span>You don't need to do anything in your application to handle ordinary recognition. The Newton system's input interface elements handle recognition of writing and drawing, including a method for users to correct misrecognized words. For example, when a user writes a word on a labeled input line, that interface element automatically passes the pen strokes to the system's text recognizer, accepts the recognized word back, and displays the typeset word. If the recognizer misreads a word, the user can double-tap the word to bring up a list of other possible matches for it, or to use the on-screen keyboard or Corrector view to correct it.  
#### User Control of Recognition 6  
Recognition is modeless. That is, users do not need to put the system in a special mode or do all their writing and drawing in a special slip. Users can write in any text-input area and draw in any shape-input area. They can also write text and draw shapes in any general-input area.  
An application that has general-input areas needs to allow users to designate whether to use the text recognizer or the shapes recognizer. In addition, users should be able to temporarily disable the text recognizer or the shape recognizer as appropriate for the type of input area. The customary way to provide control over recognition is with a Recognizer button and picker, as shown in Figure 6-14.  
**Figure 6-14** The Recognizer button and picker give users control over recognition  
![](images/_page_183_Figure_7.jpeg)  
<span id="page-184-0"></span>The Recognizer picker lists the type of recognition options that are appropriate for the type of input users can make. If users can only write text, the recognizer should only include text-recognition options—Text and Ink Text. If users can only draw shapes, the recognizer should only include shapes-recognition options—Shapes and Sketches. The Recognizer picker should include all recognition options if users can write text and draw shapes.  
The last item in the Recognizer picker is always Preferences. Selecting it gives users quick access to the handwriting recognition section of the built-in Preferences application.  
The Recognizer picker usually pops up from a Recognizer button on the left side of the status bar (next to the Info button). In addition, users may need to control recognition separately in slips. The Recognizer picker should also pop up from a Recognizer button in the lower left corner of a slip that allows users to input text or shapes if that slip covers the status bar and can't be moved out of the way. A slip should also contain its own recognition control if it allows both text and shape input but the Recognizer picker on the status bar only offers text-recognition options. Figure 6-15 shows a shows a slip with its own recognition control.

#### <span id="page-185-0"></span>Deferred Recognition 6  
A user can defer text recognition by selecting Ink Text from a Recognizer picker. While recognition is set to Ink Text, the Newton system recognizes word boundaries but does not recognize words, letters, numbers, or symbols themselves. Later a user can double-tap ink text to have the Newton system recognize it. The user can double-tap one word at a time or can select a group of words and have them all recognized by double-tapping the selection. As the Newton system recognizes a word, it displays a small curved arrow above it and then replaces the ink text with typeset text. When a user double-taps a selection of several words, the Newton system recognizes them all, displaying a small curved arrow above each one in turn, before replacing the ink text selection with typeset text.  
In general, ink text can appear anywhere regular text can appear, and the two can be mixed. Your application should permit ink text everywhere it accepts general text entry. There are times when users need the speed of ink text, and there are users who prefer ink text over recognized text. For those users, ink text is an important data-input tool. If your application does not allow ink text, you have needlessly limited the number of satisfied customers.  
Of course there are exceptions to allowing ink text universally. An application that needs to make decisions or perform calculations based on what users write can't allow ink text. For instance, the built-in Formulas application doesn't and shouldn't allow ink text, because it makes calculations based on values that users write. Similarly, an application that keeps track of mileage might allow ink text in user comments or notes, but not elsewhere. Yet that application would be more versatile if it allowed ink text everywhere and deferred calculations based on ink-text values. A user in a hurry could jot down information in ink text without worrying about recognition errors. Later the user could double-tap the ink text to have it recognized and the application could make calculations based on the newly recognized text.  
Your application does not have to disallow ink text in input fields that may be used for sorting or sequencing. If a user writes ink text in such a field, your application can display an Alpha Sorter picker, in which the user selects a sort key. [Figure 6-16](#page-186-0) shows how the built-in Names File application uses  
<span id="page-186-0"></span>an Alpha Sorter picker if a user writes ink text in the Name field (which determines the card's sequence).  
If your application simply sorts ink text with recognized text, the ink text comes before the recognized text that comes first alphabetically.

#### Forcing Recognition 6  
Under some circumstances your application may have to recognize ink text forcibly. For example, when a user tries to place a call to an ink-text phone number, the Calls application forces recognition of the ink text. If your application forces recognition, make sure it allows the user to correct mistakes in the recognized text before it acts on the text.  
#### Configuring Recognition 6  
You can configure recognition separately for each field in your application. For example, in one field you could disable recognition of shapes and configure the text recognizer to recognize only names, and in another field you could configure recognition differently.  
No matter how you have configured recognition for a text field, users can input the wrong type of text if they try hard enough. For example, a user may manage to input numbers where words are the proper type of input. This happens because every kind of text recognition uses the built-in symbols dictionary, which includes all digits and some punctuation together with all letters of the alphabet. Users have to try hard to input an improper type of text because recognition is weighted towards the proper type of text, and that is what the recognizer usually returns. But if an input stroke is vague enough, the recognizer might return an improper type of text, such as a number instead of a letter. Thus users can manage to write virtually anything in any text field.  
Here is a complete list of recognition options that applications can control:  
- Allow users to control recognition with a Recognizer button on the status bar, in a slip, or both.
- Separately enable or disable recognition of words, shapes, and editing gestures.
- Recognize words letter-by-letter without using dictionaries.
- Improve recognition of complex stroke groups in which users tend to put large spaces, such as telephone numbers. This is accomplished by disregarding spatial cues (distance between gestures or strokes), and relying solely on temporal cues (time between the end of one stroke and the beginning of the next one) to determine when a user has completed a group of strokes.
- Make the Names dictionary or any other built-in dictionary the primary dictionary. (The Names dictionary contains common names for a user's locale, not the names contained in the built-in Names application.)
- Use custom dictionaries with specialized words such as product names or plant species.
- Limit word recognition to one or more of the built-in dictionaries (proper names, surnames, first names, names of days and months, names of countries, names of states, names of cities, names of companies, abbreviations of states, common words, and user's words).  
- <span id="page-188-0"></span>■ Recognize punctuation marks. Preceding a word: single quotation mark, double quotation mark, left parenthesis, or hyphen. Following a word: single quotation mark, double quotation mark, right parenthesis, hyphen, period, comma, exclamation point, question mark, colon, or semicolon.
- Force capitalization of the first letter of every word.
- Recognize numbers, including monetary amounts, decimal points, and signs (+ and −). (Can't be used in combination with letter-by-letter recognition.)
- Recognize phone numbers. (Can't be used in combination with letter-byletter recognition.)
- Recognize dates. (Can't be used in combination with letter-by-letter recognition.)
- Recognize times. (Can't be used in combination with letter-by-letter recognition.)
