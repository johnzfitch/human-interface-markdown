The status bar, navigation bar, tab bar, and toolbar are UI elementsthat have specifically defined appearances and behaviors in iOS applications. These bars are not required to be present in every application (apps that provide an immersive experience often don't display any of them), but if they are present, it's important to use them correctly. The bars provide familiar anchors to users of iOS-based devices, who are accustomed to the information they display and the types of functions they perform.
