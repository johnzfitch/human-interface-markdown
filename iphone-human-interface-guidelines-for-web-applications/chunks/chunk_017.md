A webpage or iPhone web application that establishes and maintains focus on its prime functionality is rewarding and enjoyable to use. Especially critical for iPhone web applications, focus strengthens the user's perception of your content as a standalone solution. As you design your content, therefore, stay focused on your product definition statement and make sure every feature and user interface element supports it. See ["Design](#page-16-0) for Your Users" (page 17) for some advice on how to create a product definition statement.  
In an iPhone web application, a good way to achieve focus is to determine what's most important in each context. As you decide what to display on each page always ask yourself, is this critical information or functionality users need right now? If not, decide if the information or functionality is critical in a different context or if it's not that important after all. For example, an iPhone web application that helps users keep track of car mileage loses focus on this functionality if it also displays the car's maintenance history.  
Following the guidelines for making your content simple and easy to use also helps make your content focused. In particular, avoiding clutter and unnecessary interactivity, and minimizing user input make it easier for users to arrive quickly at the most important parts of your content, which tightens the focus on your solution (for specifics on these guidelines, see ["Simplicity](#page-20-1) and Ease of Use" (page 21)).  
For example, the built-in Calendar application (shown in Figure 3-4) is focused on days and the events that occur on them. Users can use the clearly labeled buttonsto highlight the current day,select a viewing option, and add events. The most important information, days and the events associated with them, is the most prominent. User input is simplified by allowing users to choose from lists of event times, repetition intervals, and alert options, instead of requiring keyboard entry for all input.
