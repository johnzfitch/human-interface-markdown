Friendly systems act by direct cause-and-effect; they do what they're told. Performing actions on a system in an indirect fashion reduces the sense of direct manipulation. To give users the feeling that they're in control of their machines, many of a windowing application's features are implemented with controls: graphic objects that, when directly manipulated by the mouse, cause instant action with visible results.  
There are four main types of controls: buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, and dials. These four kinds are shown in Figure 24.
