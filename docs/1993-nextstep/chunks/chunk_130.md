<!-- Chunk 130 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 126 -->
The Application Kit provides much of the user interface to menus, leaving you the task of determining application-specific characteristics such as:  
- The menu hierarchy
- The names of menu commands
- When each menu command is valid
- Keyboard alternatives  
This section describes standards for the menu hierarchy and for naming menu commands. When a command isn't valid, it should be disabled, as described later in this chapter. Chapter 3 lists all the standard and recommended keyboard alternatives.
