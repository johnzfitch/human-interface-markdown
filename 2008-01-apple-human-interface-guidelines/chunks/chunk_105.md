When the user types faster than the computer can handle or when the computer is unable to process the keystrokes, the keystrokes are queued for later processing. This queuing is called **type-ahead.** There is a limit (varying with the computer) to the number of keystrokes that can be queued, but it's usually not reached unless the user types while the application is performing a lengthy operation.  
When a character key is held down for a certain amount of time, it starts repeating automatically. The user can make adjustments to this feature, called **key-repeat,** in Keyboard & Mouse preferences.  
An application can tell whether keystrokes are generated by key-repeat or by the same key being pressed numerous times. Your application can disregard key-repeatkeystrokes; it should ignore them in keyboard shortcuts that begin with the Command key.  
Key-repeat works only when the application is ready to accept keyboard input; it does not function during type-ahead.
