Make labels for UI elements concise and easy to understand, but don't sacrifice clarity for space.  
**When the context of a label is clear, avoid repeating the contextin the label.** For example, within the context of a document-modal dialog, it's clear that the dialog acts upon a file or document, so there's no need to add the words "File" or "Document" to the Format pop-up label. Similarly, users understand that the items in an app's Edit menu act upon the current editing context, so there is seldom a need to make this explicit in the menu item names.  
**Use the correct capitalization style.** The capitalization style to use in the label for an interface element depends on the type of element. For information on the proper way to capitalize the words in labels for different types of interface elements, see [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) Labels and Text (page 47).  
**Use an ellipsis in the name of a menu item or button that produces a dialog.** The ellipsis (…) indicates that the user must take further action to complete the task. The dialog title should be the same as the menu command or button label (except for the ellipsis) used to invoke it. To learn more about using an ellipsis, see Using the [Ellipsis](#page-48-1) (page 49).
