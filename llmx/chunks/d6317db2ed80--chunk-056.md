A variant of clicking involves performing a second click shortly after the end of an initial click. If the downstroke of the second click follows the upstroke of the first by a short amount of time, and if the locations of the two clicks are reasonably close together, the two clicks constitute a double-click.  
Because of the difficulty of detecting time-between-clicks on the Apple II, it is permissible to define double-clicking simply as two clicks geographically close together and with no intervening events. Its most common use is as a faster or easier way to perform an action that can also be performed in another way. For example, clicking twice on an icon is a faster way to open it than choosing Open; clicking twice on a word to select it is faster than dragging through it.  
An operation invoked by double-clicking an object must be an enhancement, superset, or extension of the feature invoked by single-clicking that object.  
Triple-clicking is also possible; it should similarly represent an extension of a double-click.
