# THE KEYBOARD

The Apple II keyboard, unlike the Macintosh keyboard, is used for entering both text and commands.

The keys on the keyboard are arranged in familiar typewriter fashion. The U.S. keyboard is shown in Figure 3.

There are two kinds of keys: character keys and modifier keys. A character key sends characters to the computer; a modifier key alters the meaning of a character key if it's held down while the character key is pressed.
