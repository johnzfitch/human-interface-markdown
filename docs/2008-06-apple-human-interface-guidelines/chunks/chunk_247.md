A **source list** (also called a **sidebar**) is an area of a window, usually set off by a movable splitter, that provides users with a way to navigate or select objects in the application (for more information on splitters, see ["Split](#page-326-0) [Views"](#page-326-0) (page 327)). Typically, users select an object in the source list that they act on in the main part of the window. You can provide a source list asthe primary means of navigating or viewing within your application, as the Finder and iTunes do, or as a way to select a view in a part of the application, as some panes in System Preferences do.  
Figure 14-22 shows some examples of source lists that function as primary navigation and selection mechanisms.
