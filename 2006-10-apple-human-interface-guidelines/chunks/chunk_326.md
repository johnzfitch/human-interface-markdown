<span id="page-263-1"></span>Use a capacity indicator to provide information about the level or amount of something that has well defined minimum and maximum values. For example, you might use a capacity indicator to show the current level of storage-space usage on a server or the charge left in a battery.  
<span id="page-263-3"></span><span id="page-263-2"></span>There are two styles of capacityindicator, continuous and discrete. The continuous capacityindicator is a translucent track that is filled with a colored bar that indicates the current capacity value. The discrete capacityindicatoris a rowof separate,rectangular segments equal in numberto the maximum value set forthe control. These segments are stretched or shrunkto a uniform width to fit the specified length of the capacity indicator. The discrete capacity indicator displays the current capacity value rounded to the nearest integer. This means that the segments in the discrete capacity indicator are either completely filled or empty, never partially filled.  
The default color of the fill in both capacityindicator styles isgreen. Ifyou define a value for awarning level, the fill color changes to yellow when it reaches that value. If you define a value for a critical level, the fill color changes to red when it reaches that value.  
You can specify which end of the indicator is critical (red) by setting appropriate values. If you define a critical value that is greater than the warning value, the fill is green at values less than the warning level, yellow between the warning and critical levels, and red above the critical level. (This is how the warning and critical values are defined in the continuous capacity indicator shown in [Figure](#page-263-0) [14-40](#page-263-0) (page 264).) This orientation is useful if you need to display a warning when a capacity is approaching the maximum value. If you define a critical value that is less than the warning value, the fill is red belowthe critical value,yellowbetween the critical andwarning values, and green above the warning value (up to the maximum). This orientation is useful if you need to warn the user when a capacity is approaching the minimum value.  
Both continuous and discrete capacity indicators allow the display of tick marks above or below the indicator control to give context to the level shown by the fill. However, only the continuous capacity indicator should displaythe tick marks because the number andwidth of the segments in the discrete capacity indicator provide similar context.

**Carbon:** Continuous and discrete capacity indicators are not available in Carbon.  
**Cocoa:** Continuous and discrete capacity indicators are available in Interface Builder in the Controls palette. You can change the style from discrete to continuous in the Attributes pane of the NSLevelIndicator Inspector.
