<span id="page-306-1"></span>A **capacity indicator**, asits name suggests, provides graphical information about the currentstate ofsomething that has a finite capacity, such as storage space or battery charge. There are two styles of capacity indicator, continuous and discrete. A **continuous capacity indicator** is a translucent track that is filled with a colored bar that indicates the current value. For example, Figure 15-61 shows a continuous capacity indicator that represents how much space has been used (and how much space is left) in the user's mail account.

<span id="page-307-1"></span>A **discrete capacity indicator** is a row of separate, rectangular segments equal in number to the maximum value set for the control. Figure 15-62 shows a discrete capacity indicator that represents the battery charge in a Bluetooth mouse.

#### **Capacity Indicator Usage**  
Use a capacity indicator to provide information about the level or amount ofsomething that has well defined minimum and maximum values. You can configure a capacity indicator to display a different color fill when the current value enters a warning or critical range that you define (for more on this, see "Capacity Indicator Contents and Labeling"). Because capacity indicators provide a clear, easily understood picture of a current state, they're especially useful in dialogs and preferences windows that users tend to view briefly.  
Note that the discrete capacity indicator displays the current value rounded to the nearest integer, and the segments are stretched or shrunk to a uniform width to fit the specified length of the control. This means that the segments in the discrete capacity indicator are either completely filled or empty, never partially filled. This makes a discrete capacity indicator better for showing coarser-grained values than a continuous capacity indicator.  
#### **Capacity Indicator Contents and Labeling**  
The default color of the fill in both capacity indicator styles is green. If you define a value for a warning level, the fill color changes to yellow when it reaches that value. If you define a value for a critical level, the fill color changes to red when it reaches that value.  
You can specify which end of the indicator is critical (red) by setting appropriate values. If you define a critical value that is greater than the warning value, the fill is green at values less than the warning level, yellow between the warning and critical levels, and red above the critical level. This orientation is useful if you need to display a warning when a capacity is approaching the maximum value, such as the limit of storage space.  
If you define a critical value that is less than the warning value, the fill is red below the critical value, yellow between the critical and warning values, and green above the warning value (up to the maximum). This orientation is useful if you need to warn the user when a capacity is approaching the minimum value, such as the end of battery charge.

Both continuous and discrete capacity indicators allow the display of tick marks above or below the indicator control to give context to the level shown by the fill. However, only the continuous capacity indicator should display the tick marks because the number and width of the segments in the discrete capacity indicator provide similar context, making tick marksredundant. If you find that you need to display very smallsegments in a discrete capacity indicator to appropriately represent the scale of values, you might want to use a continuous capacity indicator instead.  
You should label at least the first and last tick marks to define the scale of the control and provide context for the user.  
#### **Capacity Indicator Specifications**  
**Control sizes**: Both styles of capacity indicators are available in regular size only (the bar or segment has a height of 16 pixels), but you determine the horizontal width of the control. Note that as you stretch a discrete level indicator, the number ofsegmentsremains constant, but the width of each segmentstretches accordingly.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: If you want to provide labels for tick marks in a continuous capacity indicator, use the label font (see ["Fonts"](#page-124-1) (page 125) for more information about this font). These labels should be placed 3 pixels below the lower edge of the tick marks.  
#### **Capacity Indicator Implementation**  
Continuous and discrete capacity indicators are available in Interface Builder. You can change the style from discrete to continuousin the Attributes pane of the inspector. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the NSLevelIndicator class with style NSDiscreteCapacityLevelIndicatorStyle or NSContinuousCapacityLevelIndicatorStyle.
