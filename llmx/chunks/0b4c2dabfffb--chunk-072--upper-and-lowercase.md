#### Upper- and Lowercase  
If text must be either upper or lower-cased, the application should call the IUTransliterate routine (in the Script Interface System Package) to perform the operation. The UprString routine in the Macintosh Rom is designed to be used by the File system and as such does not handle diacritical marks or non-Roman scripts correctly.
