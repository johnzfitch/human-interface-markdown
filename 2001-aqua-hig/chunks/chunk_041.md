People with a visual disability have the most trouble with the display (the screen). Software that can handle different text sizes can make it easier to support people with a visual disability. If your application is specifically used to lay out onscreen elements, you can design the software with a zoom feature that increases the view of characters or graphics.  
Color-vision deficiencies are problematic for some people. Don't create interfaces that use only color coding to convey important information. Color coding should always be redundant to other types of cues, such as text, position, or highlighting. If you allow users to select from a variety of colors to convey information, they can choose colors appropriate for their needs.
