The user moves a window by dragging any part of the window frame (see "Window [Appearance"](#page-191-0) (page 192) for more information on parts of the window). As a user drags, the full window and its contents move.  
Pressing the Command key while dragging an inactive window moves the window but does not make it active. See "Main, Key, and Inactive [Windows"](#page-221-1) (page 222) for more information about active and inactive windows.  
<span id="page-219-3"></span><span id="page-219-1"></span>Your application should never allow users to move a window to a position from which they can't reposition it.
