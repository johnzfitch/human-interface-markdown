The Enter key tells the application that the user is through entering information in a particular area of the document, such as a field in an array or table. Most applications add information to a document as soon as the user types or draws it. However, the application may need to wait until a whole collection of information is available before processing it. In this case, the user presses the Enter key to signal that the information is complete. The user can press Enter (like Return) to dismiss dialog boxes and alert boxes, if there is a default button. While the user is entering text into a *text* document, pressing Enter has no effect.

#### <span id="page-299-0"></span>Tab 10  
In text-oriented applications, the Tab key is used to move the insertion point to the next tab stop. In other contexts, Tab is a signal to proceed: it signals movement to the next item in a sequence, as shown in Figure 10-8. Pressing Tab often causes data to be entered before moving to the next item.

#### Return 10  
In text, the Return key inserts a carriage return at the current insertion point. It moves the insertion point to the beginning of the next line, as shown in Figure 10-9. In arrays, the Return key signals movement to the leftmost field one step lower on the display (like a carriage return on a typewriter). Return (like Tab) can cause data to be entered before moving down a step. The user can press Return (like Enter) to dismiss dialog boxes and alert boxes, if there is a default button.
