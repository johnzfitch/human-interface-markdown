Simple design is good design. Don't clutter the screen with too many windows, overload the user with complex icons, or put dozens of buttons in a dialog box. Because icons and dialog boxes must fit in a small space, the messages they convey must be simple and straightforward. Simple designs are easy to learn and to use, and they give the interface a consistent look.  
The icons, menus, windows, and other graphic elements on the screen make up a basic language with which the user and computer communicate. The user selects an icon and chooses an action from a menu, effectively telling the computer to "Open MacPaint," for example. For this language to work well, the messages must be simple.
