<span id="page-198-3"></span>A **dialog** is a window designed to elicit a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog, for example—permit the user to provide many responses at one time.  
**Alerts** are dialogs that appear when the system or an application needs to communicate information to the user. Alerts provide messages about error conditions orwarn users about potentially hazardous situations or actions.  
Forinformation about usingthekeyboard to interactwith dialogs, see "Keyboard Focus and [Navigation](#page-98-0) ["](#page-98-0) (page 99).  
For specific design information on how to lay out dialogs, see "Layout [Examples"](#page-278-0) (page 279).
