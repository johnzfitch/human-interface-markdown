People love OS X because it givesthem the tools and environment they need to create, manage, and experience the content they care about. A great OS X app integrates seamlessly into this environment, while at the same time providing custom functionality and a unique user experience.

Before you dive into the guidelines that help you design a great app, take a few moments to explore how OS X Yosemite uses simplicity, consistency, and depth to give users a content-focused experience.  
Yosemite simplifies many parts of the user interface (UI) to emphasize core functionality. For example, app icons simplify and clarify ornamentation, while remaining gorgeous and instantly recognizable.

The system font is a specially optimized version of Helvetica Neue, which displays textual content with beauty, clarity, and sharpness.

The combined title bar and toolbar area removes clutter from the window UI without decreasing functionality.

Yosemite refreshes and refines the OS X UI, without losing the consistency that helps people feel at home in the environment.  
Icon styles are freshly balanced to communicate a sense of harmony and stability.

The realistic icon style—used by Preview, Mail, Photo Booth, and Dictionary, among others—employs a consistent level of detail, perspective, light source, and rendering style.  
In icons that use the round graphical style—such as those in iTunes, iBooks, App Store, and Safari—the symbols use the same embossed effect, and the overall shape and use of color are consistent.

Using an optimized version of Helvetica Neue asthe system font meansthat both apps and the system present all text consistently. The use of Helvetica Neue also gives users a consistent experience when they switch between iOS and OS X.

Yosemite refines the impression of plausible, physical dimensionality in the UI. In particular, Yosemite uses translucency and vibrancy to help usersfocus on what'simportant to them. (Vibrancy is a sophisticated blending mode that lets UI elements absorb color from content that's underneath them.)  
Drop shadows, translucency, and vibrant colors help the active window stand out so that users instantly notice it.

A translucent toolbar helps the window UI recede, letting the user's content appear more prominent.

Sidebars and overlays can use vibrancy to defer to the user's content in two different ways.

A sidebar that enables app-level navigation, such as the Finder sidebar, lets users see the content behind the window.  
An overlay that provides selection and other controls that are focused on window content,such asthe Maps Directions view, gives users a more expansive view of the window's content.

Notification Center helps people stay anchored to their previous context by using a vibrant, dark appearance that automatically complements the desktop beneath it.
