You should use double-clicking only for actions that logically extend the action of a single click, and triple-clicking only for actions that extend a double-click. There are two reasons for this rule, one philosophical, the other programmatic:  
• Complex mouse actions are best remembered and understood when they appear to grow naturally out of simpler actions.  
• Every double-click includes a single click (the first click in the sequence), and every triple-click includes a double-click. At the time an application receives one click, it can't know that any others are on their way. So it must first act on the single click, then the double-click, then the triple-click.  
For example, double-clicking an icon in a Workspace Manager window picks out that icon just as a single click would. It then goes on to open the application associated with the icon. A single click in text selects an insertion point, a double-click extends the selection to a word, and a triple-click extends it further to a full line, sentence, or paragraph.  
Quadruple clicks (and above) become increasingly difficult for users to produce or understand. They're neither used nor recommended in the NeXTSTEP user interface. Triple-clicks should be used only sparingly.
