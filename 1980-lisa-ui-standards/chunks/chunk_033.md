This is a LIFO stack in which characters backspaced over are stored, and from which they may be retrieved a character at a time by pressing SHIFT-BACKSPACE (un-backspace) or a word at a time by pressing APPLE-SHIFT-BACKSPACE (un-backword).  
This buffer is cleared when the mouse button is pressed or a key other than BACKSPACE or its shifts is typed.
