Sometimes, it makes sense for an app to offer an immersive, full-screen window experience that allows users to focus on a task and avoid distractions. For example, Mail helps users read mail, manage their messages, and compose new messages within a full-screen environment.

When an app uses APIs to support full-screen windows, the standard full screen button (that is, ) is added to the upper-right corner of the title bar. The app also adds the Enter Full Screen menu item to the View menu (to learn more about this menu, see "The View [Menu"](#page-157-0) (page 158)).  
When users click the full screen button or choose View > Enter Full Screen, the app moves the window into a new space, increasing the window's size during the transition. While users are in the full-screen window, they can reveal the menu bar and the Dock (if they are hidden) and activate Mission Control. They can also move to a different desktop or full-screen window, or they might choose to take the window back to its standard size by clicking the full screen button again or choosing View > Exit Full Screen.  
Because a window remains full screen even when users switch away from it, users can leave an immersive task and come back to it later (including after a log out). Users appreciate this behavior because it allows them to create several different environments on one system.  
Note that opening a full-screen window to perform a focused task differs from the full-screen experience provided by Time Machine or Versions. These system features temporarily commandeer the user's current desktop to enable a brief user-initiated task (that is, viewing Time Machine backups or different versions of a document). Mac apps do not generally need to enable this type of full-screen experience.
