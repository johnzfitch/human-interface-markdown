The **View menu** provides commands that affect what users see in a window. In the Finder, for example, the View menu contains commands for displaying windows as columns, icons, or lists.  
<span id="page-60-7"></span>Commands for showing, hiding, and customizing a toolbar belong in the View menu. Create a View menu for these commands even if your application doesn't need to have other commands in the View menu. Show/Hide Toolbar should appear right above Customize Toolbar. The Show/Hide Toolbar commands are provided so that people using full keyboard access can implement these functions with the keyboard.  
Avoid using the View menu to display utility windows (such as tool palettes); use the Window menu instead.
