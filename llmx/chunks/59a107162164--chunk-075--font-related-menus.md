#### Font-related menus  
Three standard menus affect the appearance of text. The Font menu lets the user determine the font of a text selection or of the characters about to be typed. The FontSize menu lets the user determine the size, in points, of the characters. The Style menu lets the user determine such aspects of the text's appearance as boldface, italic, and so on.  
A font (also often called a typeface) is a set of typographical characters created with a consistent design. All the characters in a font share such features as the thickness of vertical and horizontal lines, the degree and position of curves, and the use of serifs. Serifs are fine lines added to the main strokes of a letter. The text of this book is set in various sizes and styles of a serif font. The section headings in this book, on the other hand, are set in a sans serif font, which has no serifs. The characters in a font can appear in many different point sizes, but all have the same general appearance, regardless of size. Because fonts can be either fixed-width or proportional, an application can't make assumptions about exactly how many characters will fit in a given area.
