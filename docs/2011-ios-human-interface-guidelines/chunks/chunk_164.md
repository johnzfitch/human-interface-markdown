iOS provides two styles of progress view. The appearance of each style is very similar, except for height.  
- The **default**style is white and has a weight that makesitsuitable for use in an application's main content area.
- The **bar** style is thinner than the default style, which makes it well-suited for use in a toolbar. The bar style is also white.  
As the task or process proceeds, the track of the progress view is filled from left to right. At any given time, the proportion of filled to unfilled area in the progress view gives people an indication of how soon the task or process will finish. Users do not interact with a progress view.
