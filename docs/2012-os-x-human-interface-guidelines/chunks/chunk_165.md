OS X provides several images you can use as standalone icons in toolbars. These images represent three types of items:  
- System entities or elements
- Preferences categories
- Common toolbar items  
<span id="page-323-2"></span>Use the first set of images (shown in Table B-3) to give users access to system entities, such as the network. For the most part, the images in Table B-3 identify system entities, they do not represent actions. However, if you needed to represent an action, such as "create a new smart folder," you could add a plus sign badge to the smart folder icon.  
**Table B-3** Images that represent system entities  
| Image | System element            | Constant name      |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------------|
|       | Bonjour                   | NSImageNameBonjour |
|       | Network<br>or<br>Internet | NSImageNameNetwork |  
| Image | System element                                       | Constant name             |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
|       | Dot<br>Mac                                           | NSImageNameDotMac         |
|       | The<br>Macintosh<br>computer<br>currently<br>running | NSImageNameComputer       |
|       | A<br>burnable<br>folder                              | NSImageNameFolderBurnable |
|       | A<br>smart<br>folder                                 | NSImageNameFolderSmart    |  
<span id="page-324-0"></span>The second set of images is intended for use as standalone icons in preferences window toolbars. Use these images to give users access to familiar preferences categories, such as user-account settings and advanced settings. Table B-4 shows the images you can use in a preferences window toolbar.  
**Table B-4** Images that represent common preferences categories  
| Image | Preferences category | Constant name                 |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
|       | Advanced             | NSImageNameAdvanced           |
|       | General              | NSImageNamePreferencesGeneral |
|       | User<br>accounts     | NSImageNameUserAccounts       |  
<span id="page-324-1"></span>The third set of images is suitable for toolbar items in windows other than preferences windows. You can use these images as standalone icons in a window or panel toolbar to give users access to the system-provided Colors and Fonts windows or to an Info or inspector window you supply. Table B-5 shows the images you can use in a non-preferences window toolbar.  
**Table B-5** Images that represent standard toolbar items  
| Image | Toolbar item                  | Constant name         |
|-------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
|       | Show/hide<br>information      | NSImageNameInfo       |
|       | Show/hide<br>Fonts<br>window  | NSImageNameFontPanel  |
|       | Show/hide<br>Colors<br>window | NSImageNameColorPanel |
