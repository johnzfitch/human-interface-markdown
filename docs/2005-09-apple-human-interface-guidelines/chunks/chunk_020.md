Use the information about tasks and their component steps to create an initial design, and then create a prototype of your design. Prototyping is a good way to test aspects of your design and verify how well they will work for your users. You can use a variety of techniques to construct prototypes, not all of which involve writing code. For example, you can create storyboards that visually show the appearance of your product as users go through the steps of a specific task. You can also use prototyping software to simulate some features of your product or demonstrate how it will operate.
