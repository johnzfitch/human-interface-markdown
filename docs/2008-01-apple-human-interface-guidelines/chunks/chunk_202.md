<span id="page-192-3"></span>As a developer or a designer, you should be aware of four main types of windows. Although their behavior is generally the same, they have important differences.  
- **Document windows** contain file-based user data. They present a viewinto the content that people create and store. If the document is larger than the window, the window shows a portion of the document's contents and provides users with the ability to scroll to other areas.
- **Application windows** are the mainwindows of applications that are not document-based. These windows use the standard Aqua window look and features; if the application is running in versions of Mac OS X prior to v10.5 (Leopard), thesewindows can use the optional brushed metal look.
- **Panels** float above other windows and provide tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. In some cases, panels can be transparent. In end-user documentation, panels should be called windows. Panels are discussed in more detail in ["Panels"](#page-229-0) (page 230).
- **Dialogs and alerts** require a response from the user. Dialogs and alerts are discussed in ["Dialogs"](#page-237-0) (page 238).  
Examples of all of these types of windows are shown in Figure 14-1.
