<span id="page-21-1"></span>These guidelines are designed to assist you in developing products that provide Mac OS X users with a consistent visual and behavioral experience across applications and the operating system. Following the guidelines is to your advantage because  
- users will learn your application faster if the interface looks and behaves like applications they're already familiar with
- users will accomplish their tasks quickly, because well-designed applications don't get in the user's way
- users with special needs will find your product more accessible
- your application will have the same modern, elegant appearance as other Mac OS X applications
- your application will be easier to document, because an intuitive interface and standard behaviors don't require as much explanation
- customer support calls will be reduced (for the reasons cited above)
- your application will be easier to localize, because Apple has worked through many localization issues in the Aqua design process
- media reviews of your product will be more positive; reviewers easily target software that doesn't look or behave the way "true" Macintosh applications do  
The implementation of Apple's human interface principles make the Macintosh what it is: intuitive, friendly, elegant, and powerful.
