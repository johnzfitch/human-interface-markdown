<span id="page-165-9"></span>If your application provides onscreen help, the **Help menu** should be the rightmost menu of your application's menus. The first item is the name of the application and the word "Help" (Mail Help, for example). This item should open Help Viewer to the first page of your help content. It's best to have only one item in the Help menu, but if you do have more items, they should appear below the *ApplicationName* Help item. Additional items that are distinct from your help content, such as tutorials, website links, registration information, release notes, or support information should be linked to within your help book instead of being separate items in your help menu.  
<span id="page-165-1"></span>Avoid adding multiple items to the Help menu that lead to the same place—your help book. Multiple entries that open Help Viewer can be confusing; differences between sections of your help book may not be as obvious to users as you think they are. Navigating between sections of a help book is typically best handled by providing links in the Help Viewer window.
