Ideally, users can easily figure out how to use your app without reading a user guide, but sometimes they need a little help understanding how to use an advanced or secondary feature. Follow the guidelines in this section to provide app help that doesn't get in the user's way. For detailed guidance on how to compose help content, see User [Assistance](#page-270-0) (page 271); for guidance on creating an onboarding experience, see Start [Instantly](#page-21-1) (page 22).  
**In general, provide help tags that describe how to use UI elements.** Help tags can appear when the user allows the pointer to rest over a UI element for a few seconds. A help tag consists of a small view that displays a succinct description of what the UI element does (shown here in Dictionary). Although it's best when the usage of your app's UI is instantly apparent to users, help tags can be a good way to help novice users without annoying experienced users. Because a help tag's message is short and directly linked to a specific UI element, a help tag is not the appropriate place to describe a higher-level task.

**Provide a help book that describes how to accomplish tasks in your app.** Users open an app's help book when they can't figure out how to accomplish their goal. Although users might also refer to a help book to find out how to use a specific control, they're more likely to be seeking help with a higher-level task. For this reason, your help book should be task-based, and for the most part, it should describe control usage in the context of accomplishing a task.  
**In most cases, avoid constraining user actions.** Unless you're creating a children's app in which it can be appropriate to restrict the user's scope of action, you don't want users to feel that your app is paternalistic. As much as possible, let users do what they want without unnecessary interference.
