The user should not be faced with page after page of instructions: experience has proven that people simply will not read them. Rather, supply help as it is needed. One way of doing that is described in the section on menus.  
When you try your program out on new users, be sensitive to the times they need fundamental help in using the features of the programs. For example, while you may have a program portion with detailed explanations on why ellipsoid analysis is so effective in figuring hog belly futures, your user may never get there: you may not have provided necessary help in how to enter preliminary data.  
The standard help key on the Apple IIe and Apple III series computers is either OPEN-APPLE-? or SOLID-APPLE-? (The SHIFT should not be  
required: therefore, also accept OPEN-APPLE-/ and SOLID-APPLE-/.)  
The standard help key on the Apple II and Apple II Plus, where practical, is a question mark or slash, or else ESCAPE? or ESCAPE /.  
The normal location for help messages is the bottom of the screen. Whether you use this location or another, make your location consistent. When using a separate help screen, clearly title it as a "help" display, and make the transitions as smooth as possible. When help has been given, restore the screen to its original condition.
