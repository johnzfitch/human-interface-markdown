Use a rounded rectangle button to initiate an action. When you supply a title for a rounded rectangle button, follow this approach:  
- Use title-style capitalization (that is, capitalize every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four or fewer letters)
- Avoid creating a title that is too long. Overly long text gets truncated, which can make it difficult for users to understand it.

You can specify the title or image to display in a rounded rectangle button. You can also specify that the button should highlight when it's tapped and how the title should look when the button highlights.
