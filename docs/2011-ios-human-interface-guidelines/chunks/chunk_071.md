**People should have confidence that their work is always preserved unless they explicitly cancel or delete it**. If your application helps people create and edit documents, make sure that they do not have to take an explicitsave action. iOS appsshould take responsibility forsaving people'sinput, both periodically and when they open a different document or quit the application.  
If the main function of your application is not content creation, but you allow people to switch between viewing information and editing it, it can make sense to ask them to save their changes. In this scenario, it often works well to provide an Edit button in the view that displays the information. When people tap the Edit button, you can replace it with a Save button and add a Cancel button. The transformation of the Edit button helpsremind people that they're in an editing mode and might need to save changes, and the Cancel button gives them the opportunity to exit without saving their changes.  
**For iPad, save information that people enter in a popover (unless they cancel their work)**, because they might dismissthe popover without meaning to. For more guidelinesspecific to using popovers,see ["Popover](#page-102-1) (iPad [Only\)"](#page-102-1) (page 103).
