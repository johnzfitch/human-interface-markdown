# Macintosh Guidelines Localization

This section is specific to the Macintosh family of computers. For full details, see *Inside Macintosh*.

The Macintosh Resource Manager allows the separation of code and data. Data (in the form of resources) can be edited with a number of tools such as REdit and ResEdit. Changing the appropriate resources lets you change the appearance of an application (dialog boxes, messages, menus, etc.) without re-building the application code.
