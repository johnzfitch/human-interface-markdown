MouseText-based programs have a restricted ability to deliver what-you-see-is-what-you-get: standard printer features such as bold, underline, and super- and subscript are impossible to produce on the text screen. To enable the user to see where such changes begin and end, flank the changed area with a pair of solid-diamond icons. These icons let the user know that there is some control information at those locations, but not what the information is.  
The user can "look through the keyhole" of the diamond icon by opening a view box. A view box looks like an alert box, except it has no buttons. It displays the information hidden within the solid-diamond icon:  
"Begin Underline" "End Bold Text" "Begin Plain Text"  
The view box is normally located beginning two lines below the icon's position, so that the user need look no further than necessary to see it. (The single unaffected line below the diamond enables the user to continue seeing the diamond in context.) Horizontally, approximately one-third of the view box should lie to the left of the diamond; two-thirds, to the right. This position relative to the icon should be as consistent as possible throughout your application: move it above or slide it toward one side only when you lack room on the display for its normal position.  
The contents of a view box cannot be edited. The diamond icon itself (along with its contents) can be deleted in the same manner as any other text character, and a new icon can be created with the appropriate menu command.  
The user can open a view box in one of two ways:  
- By moving the insertion point to the left of the diamond icon. In this position, the blinking underscore is directly beneath the diamond icon. (Recall that the insertion point itself lies between characters; the blinking underscore is a necessary compromise with the text hardware and appears under the character to the right of the insertion point.) The view box remains open until the insertion point is moved away from the icon, the mouse cursor is moved, or any valid short-cut key is pressed. In all of these cases, the view box remains closed until the user formally reopens it: it is not suddenly reopened when the mouse stops moving.
- By covering the diamond with the mouse cursor. It is irrelevant whether the mouse button is pressed or not: if the mouse cursor is over the diamond, the view box is opened. This enables the user to quickly view all diamonds on the display without having to relocate the insertion point, and lets the user see the

information in the same way whether simply moving the cursor around or actively marking a selection. The view box remains open until either the mouse cursor or the insertion point moves, or until any valid shortcut key is pressed.
