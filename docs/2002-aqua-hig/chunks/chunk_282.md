Speakable Items, an application built in to the Mac OS X user interface, calls the speech-recognition engine and provides all users with the ability to control their computer by voice. It does this by creating a folder in the user's Library folder (Library/Speech/Speakable Items). Anything in the Speakable Items folder is launched when the user speaks its name; saying its name is equivalent to double-clicking that item's icon, except that it works even if the folder is not visible or the Finder is not active.  
Developers can add their own items to the Speakable Items folder—such as AppleScript scripts, documents, templates, applications, or aliases—and when the user speaks the item's name it executes.  
The Speakable Items folder can also contain XML files that associate spoken commands with keyboard shortcuts. "Make this bold," for example, sends Command-B; "Copy this to the Clipboard" sends Command-C.  
The Speakable Items folder also contains an Application Speakable Items folder, which contains a subfolder for each application, so that you can create spoken commands that apply only to your application. Items in your application's folder are speakable only when your application is active (frontmost). Alternatively, you can include application-specific speakable items in a folder within your application bundle.
