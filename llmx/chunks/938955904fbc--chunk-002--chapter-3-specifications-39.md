The Desktop Interface comprises features that are generally applicable to a variety of applications, but not all of the features are found in every application. In fact, some features are hypothetical because they anticipate future needs, and may not be found in any current applications.  
This book will be most useful if you already have some experience with a desktop-based Finder program and with the concepts of pointing, clicking, and dragging with the mouse. You should also be familiar with some application programs that use windows, pull-down menus, and a mouse—preferably one each of a word processor, a spreadsheet or data base, and a graphics application.  
Although you can find examples of most of the features described in this book by looking at existing applications, no one program has fully implemented these guidelines, and perhaps none ever will. Taken together, the Finder (version 5.5), MacWrite® (version 4.5), MacPaint® (version 1.5), and MacDraw® (version 1.9) come close to containing the full set of features as described here. Because these applications evolved in parallel with the Human Interface Guidelines, none of them is a perfect implementation of the guidelines: where the application differs from the guidelines, follow the guidelines. While there are some very good applications that deviate in significant respects from these guidelines, emulate those applications only with good reason. If you do deviate from the guidelines, make sure that the user will not get into trouble by following habits learned from standard applications: a pathological example would be to change the meaning of Command-S from Save to Shut Down-without-saving.  
These guidelines are not the last word on this subject, just as the Desktop Interface is not the last interface. New features will be found that will make the interface more effective, and eventually new interfaces will appear. For now, these guidelines represent the interface that Apple recommends for all computers in the Apple II and Macintosh product lines.  
You'll find detailed implementation specifications in the technical documentation for the particular Apple computer for which you're developing software. If you haven't already done so, you can become a registered or certified developer, which makes you eligible for additional information. Contact Apple Developer Relations for details.  
This book is a joint effort of two groups at Apple: the Human Interface Group and the Technical Publications Group.

Philosophy  
The Apple Desktop Interface is the result of <sup>a</sup> great deal of concern with the human part of human-computer interaction. It has been designed explicitly to enhance the effectiveness of people. This approach has frequently been labeled userfriendly, though user centered is probably more appropriate. It has been thought of as the ideal interface for beginners, though it would be more useful to think of it as good for people in general. It has been labeled simple, though direct and effective make more sense. And it has been described as easy to learn, though accessible would be as true.
