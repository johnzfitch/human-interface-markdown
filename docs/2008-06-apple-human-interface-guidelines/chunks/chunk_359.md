<span id="page-280-3"></span><span id="page-280-2"></span>A **pop-up menu** presents a list of mutually exclusive choices in a dialog or window. The pop-up menu described in this section is suitable for use in window-body areas. If you need to provide pop-up menu functionality in a window-frame area (a toolbar or bottom bar), see ["Window-Frame](#page-248-1) Controls" (page 249) for more information on controls you can use. If you want to add pop-up menu functionality to a bevel or icon button, see "Icon Buttons and Bevel [Buttons](#page-278-0) with Pop-Up Menus" (page 279) for some specifications you can use. Figure 15-29 shows several pop-up menus in a window.

A pop-up menu behaves like other menus: Users press to open the menu and then drag to choose an item. The chosen item flashes briefly and is displayed in the closed pop-up menu. If users move the cursor outside the open menu without releasing the mouse button, the current value remains active. An exploratory press in the menu to see what's available doesn't select a new value.
