## Typeahead and auto-repeat

If the user types when the computer is unable to process the keystrokes immediately, or types more quickly than the computer can handle, the extra keystrokes are queued for later processing. This queuing is called **typeahead**. There's a limit (varying with the computer) to the number of keystrokes that can be queued, but the limit is usually not reached unless the user types while the application is performing a lengthy operation.

When a character key is held down for a certain amount of time, it starts repeating automatically. This feature is called auto-repeat. The user can set the delay and the rate of repetition with the Control Panel desk accessory. An application can tell whether a series of keystrokes was generated by auto-repeat or by pressing the same key several times. It can choose to disregard keystrokes generated by auto-repeat; this is usually a good idea for menu commands chosen with Apple-key combinations.

Holding down a modifier key has the same effect as pressing it once. However, if the user holds down a modifier key and a character key at the same time, the effect is the same as if the user held down the modifier key while pressing the character key repeatedly.

Auto-repeat does not function during typeahead. It operates only when the application is ready to accept keyboard input.
