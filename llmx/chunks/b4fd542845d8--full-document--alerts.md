#### Alerts

Every user is likely at one time or another to do something that an application can't cope with. Applications occasionally have to call the user's attention to such things as <sup>a</sup> loose mouse connection or lack of paper in the printer. Alerts let applications respond to problems in a consistent way, and in stages according to the severity of the problem, the user's expertise, and the particular history of the problem. The two kinds of alerts are beeps and alert boxes.
