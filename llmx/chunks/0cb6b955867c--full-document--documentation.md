# Documentation

- Does the manual include a glossary of potentially confusing terms that relate to the application or to the application's topic?
- If the manual refers the user to another document, is the reference more appropriate than having the information in the manual itself?
- For those who cannot handle book-form manuals, is any part of the manual available in electronic form?
- Is the manual written for its audience?
