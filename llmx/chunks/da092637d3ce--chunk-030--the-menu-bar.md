#### The menu bar  
The menu bar serves as a stabilizing element. Even when the screen changes drastically, as when the user changes from one application to another, the **menu bar** is always visible at the top of the screen, adding to the illusion of stability amid a flexible environment.  
The elements of the menu bar—the words and phrases that are the titles of the different menus—are also quite stable. Three of the menus—the Apple menu, the File menu, and the Edit menu—are **standard menus** that appear as the first three menus in almost every any application. Do not make up your own menus and then give them the same names as standard menus.  
In addition to the three standard menus, each application has its own unique menus. Because they appear to the right of the more standard menus, application-specific menus don't interfere with the user's sense of stability.
