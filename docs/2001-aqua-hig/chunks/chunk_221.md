<span id="page-191-3"></span><span id="page-191-1"></span>A new concept in Mac OS X is the notion of icon genres, which help communicate what you can do with an application before you open it. Applications are classified by role—user applications, software utilities, and so on—and each category has its own icon style. This differentiation is very important for helping users easily distinguish between types of icons in the Dock.

For example, the icons for user applications are colorful and inviting, while utilities have a more serious appearance. Figure 11-3 shows user application icons in the top row and utility icons in the bottom row. These genres are further described in ["User](#page-193-4)  [Application Icons" \(page 194\)](#page-193-4) and ["Utility Icons" \(page 197\).](#page-196-4)

The graphic flexibility of Aqua icons can also help users identify files associated with an application. In iTunes, for example, a visual cue provided in the application icon is carried over into icons for other files associated with iTunes, forming an icon family, as shown in Figure 11-4.
