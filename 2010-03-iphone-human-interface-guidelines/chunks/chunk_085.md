The status bar, navigation bar, tab bar, and toolbar are views that have specifically defined appearances and behaviorsin an iPhone application. These bars are not required to be present in every application (immersive applications often don't display any of them), but if they are present, it's important to use them correctly. The reason is that these bars provide familiar anchors to users of iPhone OS–based devices, who are accustomed to the information they display and the types of functions they perform.
