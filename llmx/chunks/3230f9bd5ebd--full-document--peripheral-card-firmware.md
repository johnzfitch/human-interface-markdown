# Peripheral Card Firmware

Any peripheral card that is to work on the Apple IIe should have firmware that takes into account the protocols of BASIC, Pascal 1.0, and Pascal 1.1. Pascal 1.1 protocols were purposely made flexible enough to meet the requirements of future versions of Pascal, extending the useful life of peripheral card firmware.

These protocols are not unique to the Apple IIe, but rather are published here to make it easier for peripheral firmware designers to find all requirements in one place.
