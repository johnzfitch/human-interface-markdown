## Optimize for Your Target Display

You should optimize your design for the display on which it will most often be seen. For example, some games run on only 4-bit and black-and-white monitors. In this case, you should optimize your design by choosing colors from the 4-bit color palette, rather than starting with the 8-bit version and trying to scale down from there.
