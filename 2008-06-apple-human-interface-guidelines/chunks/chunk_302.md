**Control sizes**: Rectangular-style toolbar controls are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. In a toolbar, display the regularsize by default, but be sure to supply the smallsize to allow usersto customize the toolbar.  
In a bottom bar, you can use either the regular or the small size, depending on the dimensions of the bottom bar. See ["Designing](#page-207-1) a Bottom Bar" (page 208) for guidelines on how to create and lay out a bottom bar.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Labelsfor rectangular-style toolbar controlsshould be in the system font appropriate for the size of the control (these fonts are automatically supplied by Interface Builder):  
- Regular size: System font.
- Small: Small system font.  
■ Mini: Mini system font.  
**Control spacing**: There should be 8 pixels between individual rectangular-style toolbar controls. Note that this happens automatically, and that this spacing can change depending on the length of the external label.
