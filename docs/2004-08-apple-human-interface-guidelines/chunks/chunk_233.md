A **disclosure triangle** allows the display, or disclosure, of information that elaborates on the primary information in a window. Disclosure triangles have two uses: in dialogs that have a minimal state and an expanded state and in hierarchical lists. See Figure 10-45 for an example in a dialog and [Figure 10-47](#page-193-3) (page 194) for an example in a hierarchical list.  
Use disclosure triangles when you want to provide a simple default view of something but need to allow the user to view more details at times.  
Disclosure triangles should be in the closed position, pointing to the right, by default. When the user clicks a disclosure triangle, it points down and the additional information is displayed.  
Disclosure triangles in dialogs should have a label indicating what is disclosed or hidden. An ideal label changes depending on the position of the disclosure triangle. For example, when closed it might say, "Show advanced settings," and when open, "Hide advanced settings."

**Carbon:** Disclosure triangles are available in Interface Builder. To create one programmatically, you can use the Control Manager function CreateDisclosureTriangleControl or the Appearance Manager function, HIThemeDrawButton.  
**Cocoa:** Disclosure triangles are available in Interface Builder. To create one programmatically, set the bezel style to NSDisclosureBezelStyle and the button type to NSOnOffButton. See *Buttons* in Cocoa User Experience documentation.
