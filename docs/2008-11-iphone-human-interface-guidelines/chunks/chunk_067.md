<span id="page-104-2"></span>iPhone OS makes available many of the standard toolbar and navigation bar buttons, tab bar items, and general-use buttons used throughout the built-in applications. You can see a handful of standard toolbar buttons in the Mail toolbar, shown in Figure 10-1.

Buttons such as the Refresh, Organize, Trash, Reply, and Compose buttons shown in Figure 10-1 are used consistently in many of the built-in applications, so users are well-acquainted with what they mean and how to use them. This means that if your application supports these functions, you can take advantage of users' familiarity to streamline the application's user interface. It also meansthat if you associate these buttons with other tasks, you're likely to confuse and irritate users by promising functionality they expect, but delivering something else.  
In addition to the benefit of leveraging users' prior experience, using system-provided buttons and icons imparts two other substantial advantages, specifically:  
- Decreased development time, because you don't have to create custom art to represent standard functions.
- Increased stability of your user interface, even if future iPhone OS updates change the appearances of standard icons. In other words, you can rely on the semantic meaning of a standard icon remaining the same, even if its appearance changes.  
It bears repeating that to realize the advantages of user familiarity, shorter development time, and semantic consistency of the user interface, you must use the buttons and icons appropriately. Specifically, this means that you should use a button or icon in accordance with its documented meaning and recommended placement, and *not* according to your interpretation of its appearance. See ["Standard](#page-105-0) Buttons for Use in Toolbars and [Navigation](#page-105-0) Bars" (page 106), ["Standard](#page-107-0) Icons for Use in Tab Bars" (page 108), and ["Standard](#page-108-0) Buttons for Use in Table Rows and Other User Interface [Elements"](#page-108-0) (page 109) for meaning and placement information for the system-provided buttons and icons.  
If you can't find a system-provided toolbar or navigation bar button or tab bar item icon that has the appropriate meaning for a specific function in your application, you should design a custom button or icon. "Icons for [Navigation](#page-114-0) Bars, Toolbars, and Tab Bars" (page 115) gives some guidelines to help you do this.
