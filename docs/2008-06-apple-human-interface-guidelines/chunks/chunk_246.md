Scope bars are useful for integrating search or filtering in your application. You might choose to provide a scope bar (instead of a separate Find window, for example) if you want the user's focus to remain on the window. Be sure that you use a scope bar only to specify and narrow a search or to filter items by specified criteria. If you need to provide a way for users to navigate or to select collections of items or data that should appear in the window, however, you should use a source list instead (described in ["Source](#page-202-0) Lists" (page 203)). For example, the Dictionary application uses a scope bar to allow usersto dynamically filter results by reference type (such as dictionary, thesaurus, or Apple dictionary), as shown in Figure 14-21.

As you choose the locations and categories that should appear in a scope bar, revisit the user's mental model of the tasks your application performs. (See ["Reflect](#page-38-3) the User's Mental Model" (page 39) for more information on discovering this cognitive model.) Determine the objects the user works with, and identify the attributes of those objects. For example, an application that allows users to create, use, and store recipes might display a scope bar when the user begins a search, providing buttons that correspond to different recipe collections.  
<span id="page-202-0"></span>If appropriate, allow users to define subsets of the locations and categories you offer by providing filter rows that display additional rules and filtering criteria. For example, the recipe application described above could display filter rowsthat allow usersto filter their results by ingredient, cuisine,seasonal availability, complexity, date last used, diet type, and other criteria. You should also allow users to save their searches. As shown in [Figure](#page-201-0) 14-20 (page 202), the Finder offers many types of additional filtering functionality and the ability to save searches.
