Modifier keys are the keys on the keyboard that alter the way other keystrokes are interpreted. They are the Shift, Option, Caps Lock, Control, and Apple (or Command) keys. Not all Apple keyboards contain all of these keys. These keys sometimes affect the way the mouse button is interpreted as well. While one of these keys is being held down, the effect of the other keys (or the mouse button) may change. Many applications It is important that these keys be used consistently from program to program, as outlined in these guidelines.  
The Shift and Option keys let the user choose between the characters on each character key. Shift gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys, or the upper character on two-character keys. The Shift key is also used in conjunction with the mouse for extending a selection. (See "Selecting.") Option gives an altemate character set interpretation, including intemational characters, special symbols, and so on. For example, in most Macintosh fonts, Option-4 produces the ¢ symbol, Option-r produces ®, Option-g produces ©, and so on. Shift and Option can be used together, in combination with a character key, to produce yet other symbols-for example, Option-Shift-? to produce the Lcharacter so important to Spanish writers.  
Caps Lock latches in the down position when pressed, and releases when pressed again. When down it gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys. Caps Lock has the same effect on alphabetic keys that the Shift key has, but Caps Lock has no effect on any other keys.  
The Apple key key is variously labeled with an Apple symbol, with a cloverleaf symbol, or with both. It has also been known as the Command key or Open Apple key. Pressing a character key while holding down the Apple key usually tells the application to interpret the key as a command, not as a character. (See "Commands.") In some applications, the Apple key is used with other keys to provide special functions or shortcuts-for example, Macintosh's Apple-Shift-3 to save a screen snapshot to disk.
