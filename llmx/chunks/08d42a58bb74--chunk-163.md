Color wells are controls that let the user choose a color. They're powerful but inherently indirect, so you should use them only when necessary. Color wells let the user choose many colors from the Colors panel simultaneously, one for each possible aspect of an object's color. For example, in the figure above, an object can have two colors-its fill color and the color of its outline.  
**Note:** The Colors panel is an Application Kit panel discussed in Chapter 5, "Panels." The Colors panel is brought up by the Colors command; it also appears whenever the user selects a color well's border.  
One alternative to using a color well, when the group of acceptable colors is small, is to use graphical radio buttons (as pictured in the "Buttons" section earlier in this chapter). Another alternative, when a wide range of colors is needed, is to use the Colors panel alone. The user can change an object's color by selecting it and then choosing the new color in the Colors panel. You can also use a new, customized control if it's more appropriate in appearance and functionality than a color well.  
To choose a color for a color well, the user drags a color either from the Colors panel or from another color well. Another way to set the color is to select the border of the color well. The well's color then changes every time a new color is chosen in the Colors panel. Because the user might not realize a border is selected, this scheme can be confusing. You should be careful to deselect the border whenever the user isn't likely to want to change the color. For example, you should make sure'that color wells are deselected when their window is miniaturized.  
When an object is selected, each visible color well should change its color to reflect the object's associated color. For example, if a white box with a red border is selected, then the Fill well shown in the previous figure should contain white, and the Line well should contain red. Once the user changes the color in a well, that change should be reflected in the selected object. For example, dragging a swatch of green from the Colors panel into the Line well should immediately make the outline of the selected box green.  
Whether or not a color well's border is selected should have no effect on whether the well affects the object that's currently selected.
