You can use arrow keys in these ways:  
■ In text, the arrow keys move the insertion point. When used with the Shift key, they extend or shrink the selection. If the user makes a selection and then presses the Right Arrow or Left Arrow, shrink the selection to zero length and place the insertion point at the right or left edge of the selection.  
- In lists, the arrow keys change the selection.
- In a graphics application, the arrow keys can be used to move a selected object the smallest possible increment (one pixel or one grid unit).
- In full keyboard access mode, the arrow keys move between values within a control. This behavior is described in ["Keyboard Focus and Navigation"](#page-181-2) [\(page 182\).](#page-181-2)  
Don't use the arrow keys to  
- move the mouse pointer onscreen
- duplicate the function of the scroll bars  
If it's important for your application to make use of the numeric keypad, don't use the Shift–arrow key combinations to extend text selections; the keypad's codes for the four Shift–arrow key combinations are the same as those for the keypad's +, \*, /, and = keys.
