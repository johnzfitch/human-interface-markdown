#### Implementing Pop-Up and Pull-Down Lists

You must provide a title for each pop-up list. Usually this is done by putting a titled box around the pop-up list's button. The figure below shows a typical example, using a box with the title Units.

Because the label on a pull-down list's button doesn't change, pull-down lists don't need a titled box around them.

When using a pop-up or pull-down list, be careful that the open list doesn't blend in with the objects near it. If an item in the list pops up next to a label, for example, users might interpret them in combination. Take care, too, that the open list doesn't obscure any objects that help users understand its content.
