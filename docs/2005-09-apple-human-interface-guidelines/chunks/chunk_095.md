Ifyou provide userswith a downloadable version ofyour application on the Internet,you can simplify the installation process by packaging your software in an Internet-enabled disk image. Disk images eliminate the need to compress your files, because the disk image itself can compress the enclosed data. After the disk image is downloaded, Mac OS X automatically opens it and mounts it on the user's desktop. All the user has to do is copy over the desired files or run the installer.
