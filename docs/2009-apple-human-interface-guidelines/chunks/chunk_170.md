Although toolbar icons should conserve screen real estate (32 x 32 pixels is the recommended size), they should be inviting and easy to identify. The perspective of a toolbar icon is straight-on, as if it is sitting on a shelf in front of you (see "Icon [Perspectives](#page-144-0) and Materials" (page 145) for a graphic depiction of this perspective).  
Although the perspective of icons designed specifically for use in a toolbar is straight-on, if you use a recognizable icon from elsewhere in the interface (such asthe iDisk icon), that icon should retain itsstandard appearance and perspective. That is, don't redesign a toolbar version of a well-known interface element. You may be able to use a system-provided image to represent a standard interface element;see ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) [Images"](#page-154-0) (page 155) for more information on which images are available and how to use them.
