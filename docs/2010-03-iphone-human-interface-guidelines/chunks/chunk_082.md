Every application, regardless of type, has an application window. Programmatically, the window provides the background on which you present all your application's information. But users are not aware of this window; instead, they experience your application as a collection of screens through which they navigate.  
Although it's not a programmatic construct, you can think of a screen as corresponding to a distinct visual state or mode in your application. Users can see individualscreens when they navigate through an information hierarchy, tap different tabs in a tab bar, or tap an Info button to view flip-side configuration options.  
Depending on the style of your application, you might have a large number of screens or just a few. For example, Mail can display an accounts screen, screens that list the mailboxes in each account, screens that list the contents of each mailbox, and a screen for each message, in addition to a message composition screen. On the other hand, the Stocks application displaystwo screens: One screen displays a list of companies and a stock-performance graph and the second screen displays application configuration information.  
For the most part, users think of an application screen and the device screen as identical. However, an application screen's content can extend beyond the bounds of the device screen, requiring users to scroll. For example, the Contacts screen is a single screen in the Phone application, even though it's likely to list enough names to fill the device screen several times over.  
Each application screen can contain various combinations of views and controls. Some views include specific controls that do not belong anywhere else, and some controls can be used in a variety of views.  
Alerts, action sheets, and modal views are distinct types of views that do not exist in an application screen like most other views; instead, they float above application screens and their views. See "Alerts, Action [Sheets,](#page-78-0) and Modal [Views"](#page-78-0) (page 79) for more information about these views.  
Four types of views have special status in the user interface of an application, although they do not need to be included or always be visible in every application. These are:  
■ **The status bar**. This is a unique view that isn't technically part of the application window, although an application can customize the appearance of the status bar to some extent. See "The [Status](#page-66-1) Bar" (page 67) for more information.  
- **The navigation bar**. This optional view appearsjust beneath the status bar and can include titles, buttons, and segmented controls. See ["Navigation](#page-67-0) Bars" (page 68) for more information.
- **The tab bar**. This optional view appears at the bottom edge of a screen and contains segments that activate different modes in the application. See "Tab [Bars"](#page-72-1) (page 73) for more information.
- **The toolbar**. This optional view appears at the bottom edge of a screen and includes controls that perform specific actions in the current context of the application. See ["Toolbars"](#page-70-1) (page 71) for more information.  
<span id="page-63-0"></span>Figure 5-1 shows three of these views in an application screen. Note that if this application used a toolbar, it would appear in place of the tab bar.

In an application that displays some combination of these four views, you can think of the area between the bottom of the navigation bar and the top of the toolbar or tab bar as the **content area**. In this area, an application screen can contain arbitrary views to display content, such as table views, web views, and image views. Figure 5-2 shows examples of two of the content-area views available in iPhone OS: a style of table view and image views. To learn more about the behavior and appearance of some of these views, in addition to the controls associated with them, see "Table Views, Text Views, and Web [Views"](#page-88-0) (page 89).

As mentioned above, there are some controls that are available only in specific views. An example of such a control is the disclosure indicator, which has a specific use in a table view. You can see an example of the disclosure indicator (it looks like >) in the left-hand list in [Figure](#page-88-3) 8-1 (page 89). These controls are described in the sectionsthat cover their associated views. In addition to these, however, there are a handful of controls, such as the detail disclosure indicator, that have a wider usage. See ["Application](#page-106-0) Controls" (page 107) for more information on the controls available to you.
