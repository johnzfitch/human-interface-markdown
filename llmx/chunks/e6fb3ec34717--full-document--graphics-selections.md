# Graphics Selections

There are several different ways to select graphic objects and to show selection feedback in existing Macintosh and Apple II applications. MacDraw, MousePaint, and the Macintosh Finder all illustrate different possibilities. This section describes the MacDraw paradigm, which is the most extensible to other kinds of applications.

A MacDraw document is a collection of individual graphic objects. To select one of these objects, the user clicks once on the object, which is then shown with knobs. (The knobs are used to stretch or shrink the object, and won't be discussed in this manual.) Figure 9 shows some examples of selection in MacDraw.

Figure 9. Graphics Selections in MacDraw

To select more than one object, the user can select either a range or a multiple selection. A range selection includes every object completely contained within the dotted rectangle that encloses the range, while an extended selection includes only those objects explicitly selected.
