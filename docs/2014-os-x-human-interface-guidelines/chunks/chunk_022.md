Almost all apps need to use some words to communicate with users, even if the only words are in button labels. It'simportant to choose all of your app's words carefully so that you can ensure that your communication with users is unambiguous and accurate.  
**In general, avoid jargon.** Above all, you want to use the terminology your users are comfortable with. If your app targets sophisticated users who frequently use a set of specialized, technical terms, it may make sense to use these terms in your app. But if your user audience consists of mostly novice or casual users, it's usually better to use simple, widely understood terms. For example, the Parental Controls preferences pane uses simple, straightforward language to describe the feature and explain what the user can do.

<span id="page-44-0"></span>**Avoid developer terms.** As a developer, you refer to UI elements and app processes in ways that most of your users don't understand. Be sure to scrutinize the UI and replace any developer terms with appropriate user terms. For example, Table 12-1 lists several common developer terms, along with equivalent user terms you should use if you need to refer to these items in the UI.  
**Table 12-1** Some developer terms and their user term equivalents

**Use proper Apple terminology.** If you need to refer to standard parts of the UI or to system features, use the terms that Apple defines. For example, to describe the use of a checkbox in your UI, tell the user to "select" the checkbox, not to "check," "click," or "turn on" the checkbox. If you mention how to start your app by clicking the app icon in the Dock, be sure to capitalize "Dock." You can learn more about Apple terminology by reading *Apple Style Guide* .
