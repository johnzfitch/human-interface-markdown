When implementing any kind of button, you must make the following decisions:  
- The end result of clicking the button
- The image or label (or both) on the button
- How the button's appearance changes during a click  
Of course, before using a button, you should be sure that it's the best control for the job. "Choosing the Appropriate Control," at the end of this chapter, discusses which controls can be used for which types of functionality.  
#### Choosing the Button's Result  
A one-state (action) button shouldn't change the action it performs. Although it's sometimes tempting to alter the action with the application's state—to switch between Erase and Restore, for example—it's best to provide a different button for each action and disable those that aren't operable. This lets the user safely click in the accustomed place without having to consider which state the application is in. However, it's acceptable for buttons that perform time-consuming actions to have a stop state, as described in "Implementing Stop Buttons," later in this chapter.  
One-state buttons are generally labeled with a verb or verb phrase (such as Find), but occasionally they have only a graphic image (such as the arrowhead in a scroll bar button). Labeling conventions are discussed in "Choosing the Button's Image or Label," below.  
Two-state buttons should never perfonn actions, although the characteristic they affect might result in some visible change. For example, an inspector for a graph might have a set of radio buttons that control the graph's type (line, bar, and so on). Clicking one of the buttons resets the graph's type, which in tum results in the graph being redrawn. However, it wouldn't be acceptable for the radio button to, for example, create a second graph of the new type.  
Ideally, as soon as the user clicks a two-state button, the visible consequences (if any) should be shown immediately. However, that's not always practical, as when changing the characteristic takes a long time or isn't easy to reverse. For example, if changing the type of a graph takes a long time, then the application might wait for the user to click a Redraw Graph button before redrawing the graph.  
However, whether or not a two-state button's associated characteristic changes immediately, the button's appearance always changes immediately, as described in "Changing the Button's Appearance during a Click," later in this chapter.  
Buttons with more than two states aren't recommended: It's very difficult to convey their result to the user.  
#### **Choosing the Button's Image or Label**  
A button's label should say, in a succinct shorthand, what action it causes the application to take. Even when a button purports to label a state (such as AM or PM), users are apt to think of it not as the current state, but as the state that will be set if the button is clicked. In other words, they're liable to interpret it as an action. An On button, for example, is more likely to be interpreted to mean "Press this to tum something on" than "This is now on."  
It's best, therefore, to use images and highlighting to show the current state, and reserve the button's label as a brief statement of what the button does. Buttons that do label a state, such as a button that switches between AM and PM, should be used only where what they label is clearly visible. For example, AMIPM buttons can be used alongside a digital representation of the time, but they can't stand alone. These and other two-state buttons are shown in the figure in the following section.  
**Note:** Make sure that the button clearly looks like either an action button or a two-state button. It's confusing to the user to see a two-state button that doesn't clearly have two states, or an action button that doesn't look like it perfonns an action.  
You should always dim the label of a button (using gray text) whenever pushing the button will have no effect. A dimmed button is completely disabled-pushing it shouldn't cause it to highlight, push in, or change in any other way.  
Button labels should be capitalized like menu commands: The first and last words begin with uppercase letters and the words between are capitalized as they would be in a title. Like menu commands, buttons that always bring up a panel (unless it's a warning panel) should have three dots ( ... ) at the end of the label.  
When an action button can be chosen using the Return key, the button should contain the Return symbol to the right of its label, as shown below at the left. However, when pressing Return won't choose the button-for example, when the button's window isn't the key window-the Return symbol should disappear from the button (as shown at the right, below). Removing the Return symbol helps avoid user confusion over whether pressing Return will work.

#### Programming Note: Making the Return Symbol Disappear  
All Application Kit panels automatically remove the Return symbol when the panel isn't the key window. Attention panels created with NXRunAlertPanel() and its related functions also remove the Return symbol automatically.  
For other panels, you need to explicitly remove and add the Return symbol for the appropriate button. You can do so in your implementation of the windowDidResignKey: and windowDid8ecomeKey: delegate methods of the Window class.
