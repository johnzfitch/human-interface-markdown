## When to use sound

There are two general ways that sound can be used in the interface:

- It can be integrated throughout the standard interface to help make the user aware of the state of the computer or application.
- It can be used to alert the user when something happens unexpectedly, in the background, or behind the user's back.

In general, when you would like to put an indicator on the screen to tell the user something—for example, to tell the user that mail has come in, or to show a particular state—this is a good time to use a sound.
