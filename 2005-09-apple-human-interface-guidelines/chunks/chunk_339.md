<span id="page-267-4"></span>The **tab view** provides a convenientwayto present information in a multipane format. The tab control displays horizontally centered across the top edge of a content area.  
The content area below the control is called a **pane.** In a window with a tab view, you can use other controls, such as push buttons and text entry fields.The controls can be global—affecting the settings of all panes—or specific to an individual pane; make it clear through labeling and placement (within or outside of a pane's boundary) whether a control affects one pane or all panes.  
A segmented control can provide a way to switch between panes. It looks similar to a tab view, but it is not attached to the panes. See ["Segmented](#page-233-0) Control" (page 234).
