Branding is most effective when it issubtle and understated. People use your iPhone application to get things done or to be entertained; they don't want to feel as if they're being forced to watch an advertisement. Therefore, you should strive to incorporate your brand's colors or images in a refined, unobtrusive way. For example, you might use a custom color scheme in views and controls.  
The exception to this is your application icon, which should be focused on your brand. (The application icon is the icon users can see on their Home screens after they install your application.) Because users see your application icon frequently, it's important to spend some time balancing eye-appeal with brand recognition. For some guidelines on creating an application icon, see ["Application](#page-128-1) Icons" (page 129).
