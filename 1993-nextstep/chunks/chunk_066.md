Applications that allow text selection are encouraged to implement the modifier-arrow combinations described in this section. Modifier keys alter the basic behavior of the arrow keys, but retain the basic orientation of each of the four keys. Before reading this section, you should understand the existing behavior of the unmodified arrow keys, described in "How the Arrow Keys Affect a Text Selection" earlier in this chapter.
