Table 9-2 describes how to extend text selection by pressing the Shift key with the arrow keys.  
If no text is selected, the extension begins at the insertion point. If text is selected by dragging, then the extension begins at the selection boundary. For example, in the phrase *stop time,* if the user places the insertion point between the "s" and "t" and then presses Shift–Option–Right Arrow, *top* is selected. However, if the user double-clicks so the whole word is selected, and then extends the selection left or up, it's as if the insertion point were before the "s." If the user extends the selection right or down, it's as if the insertion point were between the "p" and the space after the word.  
Reversing the direction of the selection deselects the appropriate unit. In the previous example, if the word *stop* is selected and the user presses Shift–Option–Right Arrow, so *stop time* is selected, and then presses Shift–Option–Left Arrow, *time* is deselected and *stop* remains selected.
