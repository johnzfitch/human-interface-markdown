In most computer systems, the keyboard is the primary input device. In the Apple Desktop Interface, on the other hand, the pointing device is central. A pointing device makes possible the direct manipulation that is a central part of the Desktop Interface. The user can communicate with the computer by manipulating graphic objects on the screen. This manipulation is direct because the user can grab (or seem to grab) an object, then indicate what isto be done with it. How do you "grab" an object that you see only as a two-dimensional representation on a glass screen? By pointing at it with a pointing device.  
In the Apple Desktop Interface, the standard pointing device is the mouse, but there are other devices (track balls and graphics pens, for example) that perform the same functions. The mouse is<sup>a</sup> hand-held device, usually (but not necessarily) connected to the computer by <sup>a</sup> long, flexible cable. There's <sup>a</sup> single button on the mouse. The user holds the mouse and rolls it on <sup>a</sup> flat, smooth surface. On the screen, <sup>a</sup> pointer, which can assume different shapes according to the context of the application, follows the motion of the mouse.  
Simply moving the mouse (without pressing the mouse button) just moves the pointer. Most actions take place only when the user positions the pointer over an object on the screen, then presses and releases the mouse button.
