# Perceived stability

Users feel comfortable in a computer environment that remains understandable and familiar rather than changing randomly.

People use computers because computers are versatile and fast. Computers can calculate, revise, display, and record many kinds of information far faster than people can. If users are to cope with the complexity that the computer handles- so easily, they need some stable reference points.

To provide a visual sense of stability, the Apple Desktop Interface provides a twodimensional space on which objects are placed. It also defines a number of consistent graphic elements (menu bar, window border, and so on) to maintain the illusion of stability.

To provide a conceptual sense of stability, the interface provides a clear finite set of objects and <sup>a</sup> clear finite set of actions to perform on those objects. Even when particular actions are unavailable, they are not eliminated from a display, but are merely dimmed.

It is the illusion of stability that is important, not stability in any strict physical sense. The environment can, and should, change as users interact with it, but users should feel that they have a number of familiar "landmarks" to count on.
