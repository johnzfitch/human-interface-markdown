To get an overview of the technologies available in Mac OS X, you should read *MacOS X TechnologyOverview*.  
The Mac OS X Reference Library website at <http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/navigation/> has links to API reference and conceptual documentation for many of the topics discussed in this book.  
If you are using Xcode, you can peruse the Reference Library without leaving the Xcode development environment. In the Xcode Help menu, choose Documentation to open a document-viewing window. (For more information about using Xcode, see *Xcode Workspace Guide*.)  
The *Apple Publications Style Guide* provides information helpful for choosing the correct language and terminology to use throughout your application in text displays and dialogs as well as your documentation.  
To get access to pre-release software, technical support, and the Apple Developer Forums, you can sign up to become a Mac developer. For more details about this program, see [http://developer.apple.com/pro](http://developer.apple.com/programs/mac/)[grams/mac/.](http://developer.apple.com/programs/mac/)
