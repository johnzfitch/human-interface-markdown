# #1. Color

By: Katie Withey & Annette Wagner

Date: 31 March 87

This information will be in the final versions of Inside Macintosh, vol. V and Human Interface Guidelines: the Apple Desktop Interface (to be published by Addison Wesley)

Apple's goal in adding color to the desktop user interface is to add meaning, not just to color things so they "look good". Color can be a valuable additional channel of information to the user, but must be used carefully; otherwise, it can have the opposite of the effect you were trying for, and can be overwhelming visually (or look game-like).

Color is ultimately the domain of the user, who should be able to modify or remove any coloring imposed by the application. Unless you are implementing a color application such as a paint or draw program, you should consider color only for the data, not the interface.

In order to successfully implement color in an application, you should understand some of the complex issues surrounding its use. Many major theories on the proper use of color are not complete or well defined. The way in which the human eye sees color is not fully understood, nor are color's subjective effects.
