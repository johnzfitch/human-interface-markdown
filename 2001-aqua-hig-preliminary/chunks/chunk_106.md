Dragging means pressing the mouse button, moving the mouse to a new position, and releasing the mouse button. The uses of dragging include selecting blocks of text, choosing a menu item, selecting a range of objects, moving an icon from one place to another, and shrinking or expanding an object.  
Dragging a graphic object should move the entire object (or a transparent representation of it), not just the object's outline.  
Your application can restrict an object from being moved past certain boundaries, such as the edge of a window. If the user drags an object and releases the mouse button outside of the boundary, the object stays in the original location. If the user

Your application can also automatically scroll a document if the user moves an object beyond the boundary of a window (see ["Automatic Scrolling" \(page 63\)\)](#page-62-0).
