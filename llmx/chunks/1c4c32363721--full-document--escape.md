#### Escape

The Escape key has the general meaning "let me out of here." It's <sup>a</sup> sort of panic button for the new user. In certain contexts its meaning is specific:

- The user can press Escape as a quick way to indicate Cancel in a dialog box.
- The user can press Escape to stop an operation in progress, such as printing. (Using Escape this way is like pressing Apple- or Command-period.)

If an application absolutely requires a series of dialog boxes (a fresh look at program design usually eliminates such sequences), the user should be able to use Escape to move backward through the boxes.

Pressing Escape should never cause the user to back out of an operation that would require extensive time or work to reenter. And pressing Escape should never cause the user to lose valuable information. When the user presses Escape during <sup>a</sup> lengthy <sup>I</sup> operation, the application should display a confirmation dialog box to be sure Escape wasn't pressed accidentally.
