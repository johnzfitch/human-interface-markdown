#### Paste  
The Paste command inserts the contents of the Clipboard in a document at the insertion point. It replaces any current selection. The user can choose the Paste command several times in a row to insert multiple copies of the Clipboard contents. After a paste operation, make the object that was pasted the new selection, unless the user pasted text. In this case, place an insertion point after the inserted text. In either case, leave the contents of the Clipboard unchanged.  
People use the Paste command as the last stage of a move or copy operation. Figure 4-78 shows how the Paste command works.  
The Command-V combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Paste command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
