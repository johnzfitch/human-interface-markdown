Clicking in a window brings it to the front of its tier, provided that the click isn't in a title bar button. The window is reordered immediately as the mouse button is pressed. If the user is dragging the window to a new location, this lets the window assume its reordered position before being moved.  
Another way the user can reorder windows is to press the Command key while pressing the up-arrow or down-arrow key. Command-up arrow moves the backmost panel (if it's in the lowest tier) or standard window to the front of the tier. Command-down arrow moves the frontmost one to the back.
