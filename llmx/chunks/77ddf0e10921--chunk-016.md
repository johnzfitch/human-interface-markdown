In order to properly address the needs of the users, you must first know who they are and what their needs are. Software design should begin with a user-profile study. This study should cover the following three phases:  
- 1. Select the target audience. Begin your human interface design by identifying your target audience. Are you writing for businesspeople or children? Will your audience consist of people relaxing at home or accountants under severe time constraints?
- Ascertain the level and limitations of their pre-existing knowledge.
You should have an understanding of how much the target users know about:
- A. using the Apple computer
- B. the general subject matter your program deals with.
- 3. Identify their needs. Once you have an understanding of the knowledge and limitations of the users, you can then figure out what types of information and level of support the the program will have to supply.  
Figures 1 and 2 are mythical examples of two possible user-profiles for programs that fill the exact same function: tax planning. Even though the task performed, the formulas used, the raw data required are identical, the programs that would result from the two user-profiles might bear little external resemblance.  
The "research" quoted in the examples is ficticious—do not start writing a tax planner based on it. (The "case histories" in this document are real; the samples of display and document designs are fictitious.)  
Carrying out an early investigation such as the ones above requires a minimum of time and can save you man-months of work later on. The reports need not be works of art; it is only important that every member of the design team have a clear picture of who the audience for this product will be.  
Make sure you consider all your users:  
In a data-base program recently developed for a computer with large mass storage, no effort was spared in making every section of the program as "friendly" as possible. When a particular task proved somewhat difficult to learn or use, the task was reduced by picking up bits and pieces of it within other tasks. The program slowly drifted toward being consistently somewhat difficult to learn and use.
