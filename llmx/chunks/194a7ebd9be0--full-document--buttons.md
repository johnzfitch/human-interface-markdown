#### Buttons

A button is a small object labeled with text. Clicking or pressing a button performs the action described by the button's label. Label each button according to the *result* of pressing it. If the question is *Save Changes?* then *Save* and *Don't Save* are more meaningful than *Yes* and *No*. If one button in a group is the default button, it has a darker border than the other(s).

Buttons usually perform instantaneous actions, such as completing operations defined by a dialog box or acknowledging error messages. They can also perform continuous actions, in which case the effect of pressing on the button (holding it down) would be the same as the effect of clicking it repeatedly.

Two particular buttons, OK and Cancel, are especially important in dialogs and alerts. They're discussed under "Dialogs" and "Alerts."
