**Control sizes**: The outer dimensions of an icon button are not visible, but they determine the hit target area. Typically, the outer dimensions of an icon button include a margin of about 10 pixels all the way around the icon and label.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Use the small system font for the labels. The text should be below the icon as shown in Figure 15-11.  
**Icon sizes**: Icons for icon buttons work best when they are between 24 x 24 pixels and 32 x 32 pixels in size. For example, the icon shown in Figure 15-11 is 32 x 32 pixels.

**Control spacing**: For buttons with a 24 x 24 pixel (or larger) icon, leave at least 8 pixels between button edges (not between icon edges), stacked vertically or aligned horizontally.
