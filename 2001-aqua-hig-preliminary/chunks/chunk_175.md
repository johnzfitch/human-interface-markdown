- Do you use the new standard alert APIs for displaying alerts?
- Do you display your application icon in all dialogs? Do you also show the caution icon in potentially data-damaging alerts?
- Does your application use the system alert sound so that the user's menu bar automatically flashes (inverts rapidly) if the sound is turned off when they receive an alert message?
- Does the alert have an informative title and text that not only tell the user what is wrong, but also offer suggestions as to what to do to correct it? The best alert messages answer the following questions: What happened? Why did it happen? What can I do about it?
- Are all your alerts necessary? You can prevent many user errors with good or preventative interface design. For example, if the application cannot handle an 80-character filename, don't display an 80-character field in which to enter it.
