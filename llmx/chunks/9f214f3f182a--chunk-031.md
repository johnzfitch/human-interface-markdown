<!-- Chunk 31 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 359 -->
The first time a user runs a program he has quite different needs from the tenth time he uses it. In the beginning, he needs as much information presented as possible so that he can use the program with a minimum of learning. Later on, with a program used habitually, he wants speed and simplicity. He wants only information pertinent to the specific task being carried out, not a lot of instructions on how to delete an incorrect response.  
Most large programs now have some sort of utility/configuration section. The configuration sections often enable the user to select date and time formats, color vs. black and white, and whether or not to have sound. In that  
section, you can also enable the user to select a skill level. The rest of the program can then use the resulting flag, when set to expert, to simplify verbiage and perhaps enable more flexible branching within the program—branching that would serve to get the novice into trouble but gives the expert the added flexibility she needs.  
The skill level selection could be more sophisticated, perhaps with more than two levels, perhaps based on the type of user. For example, a single tax planner program might better bridge the gap between accountant and Apple owner if the accountant could select, "Expert at taxes, Novice at Apple" and the Apple owner could select "Novice at taxes, Expert at Apple". (The possible combinations and permutations are truly boggling.)
