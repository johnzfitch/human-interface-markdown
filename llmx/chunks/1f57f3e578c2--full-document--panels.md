# Panels

If the application divides <sup>a</sup> document window more or less permanently into different areas, each having a different content, these areas are called panels. Unlike panes, which show different parts of the same document but are functionally identical, panels are functionally different from each other but might show different interpretations of the same part of <sup>a</sup> document. For example, one panel might show <sup>a</sup> graphic version of <sup>a</sup> document while another panel shows a text version, or one panel might show <sup>a</sup> numeric representation of some data while another shows <sup>a</sup> graph based on the same data.

Panels, like windows, can have scroll bars and can be split into more than one pane. Whether to use panels instead of separate windows depends on the application. Multiple panels in the same window are more compact than separate windows, but they have to be opened, moved, and closed as a unit.
