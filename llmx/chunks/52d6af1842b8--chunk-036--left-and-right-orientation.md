#### **Left and Right Orientation**  
To start, the two buttons of the mouse work identically: Either button can be used for the ordinary operations of clicking, dragging, and pressing.  
The two buttons can be differentiated with the Preferences application. Users can enable one of the buttons, either the right or the left, for the special function of bringing the main menu to the cursor. (See "Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor" in Chapter 6, "Menus," for details.) Thereafter, the enabled button has only that function, and it can't be used for ordinary mouse operations. This leaves the other button as the one that will be primarily used.
