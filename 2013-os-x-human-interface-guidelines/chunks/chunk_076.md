OS X provides a standard panel for picking fonts. As shown below, the standard Fonts window also includes several controls for adjusting a font's characteristics. (The minimal version of the Fonts window allows users to choose a font, typeface, and size.)

If your app supports typography and text layout using user-selectable fonts, you should use the Fonts window to obtain the user's font selection rather than create a custom font-picker window.  
The standard Fonts window also provides advanced typography controls for fonts that support those options. The user can open a Typography inspector by choosing Typography from the action menu (shown above). For example, the Typography inspector shows the typography controls for the Zapfino font.
