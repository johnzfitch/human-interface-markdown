## Provide Concurrent Help

A usable help system must present instructions within the users' working context so that they can actually do the actions that they are instructed to perform. If a help system obscures or replaces users' work, they might forget the specifics of their problem. In addition, users would have to read and memorize the help before returning to their work. When users activate help, do not switch them to a separate application or mode for delivering the information. Rather, display the information within the working context so that the user's application remains active or in control. In other words, allow the user to find the necessary help information while working on their particular task. Balloon Help is an example of help that doesn't take users out of their current context, but allows them to see the problem and solution simultaneously. See "Balloon Help," beginning on page 316, for a description of Balloon Help.
