Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time. (Contrast this criterion with a utility window, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer.) Some examples of uses of drawers include access to favorites lists, the Mailbox drawer (in the Mail application), or browser bookmarks.  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are primarily intended to replace modal dialogs, as described in ["When to Use Sheets" \(page 94\)](#page-93-1), whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.
