An **inspector** is a panel that allows users to view the attributes of a selection. Inspectors (sometimes called inspector windows) can also provide ways to modify these attributes.  
Modern OS X apps often present inspector information within a main window instead of a separate inspector window. For example, Keynote displays multiple inspector panes within the main window.

**Ensure that an inspector updates dynamically based on the current selection.** Users expect an inspector's view to always be up to date. Similarly, they expect the changes they make in an inspector to immediately affect their content. Contrast this behavior with that of an Info window, which shows the attributes of the item that was selected when the window was opened, even after the focus has been changed to another item. Also, an Info window is not a panel; it islisted in the app's Window menu, and it does not hide when the app becomes inactive.  
**Consider providing both inspectors and Info windows in your app.** In some cases users want one window in which context changes with each new item they select (an inspector), and in other cases they want to see the attributes of more than one item at the same time (a set of Info windows). Note that users can open multiple inspector windows and Info windows in the same app at the same time.
