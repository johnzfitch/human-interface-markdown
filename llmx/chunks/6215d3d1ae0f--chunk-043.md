<!-- Chunk 43 | Source: 1986-12 Human Interface Guidelines (Final Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 622 -->
The more open documents on a desktop, the more difficult it is for the user to locate, select, and resize the one to be worked on. Some Apple computers have a feature in ROM that allows users—with a single mouse click in the window's **zoom box**—to drag and size the active window to a size and location they previously selected, and then to return the window to full size with another click. Figures 14 and 15 show a window in the standard state and in the user-selected state.  
If this feature is present, the zoom box (shown in Figure 14) is present at the right end of the window's title bar. Because window zooming is not available on all Apple computers, application programs must check the ROM and, if the feature is not present, bypass it. (Window zooming does not involve the variable magnification you get with a zoom lens).  
Application developers are encouraged to use the zoom window function on systems that make it available.

The application supplies the values for the size and location of the **standard state** of the window as well as the initial values for the size and location of the user-selected state. The standard state is generally the full screen, or close to it, and should be the size and location best suited to working on the document. As often as they want, users can specify the **user-selected state** of the window, generally the size and location best suited to organizing the desktop so that documents can be found and selected.  
The user can't change the standard size and location, but the application can change it within context. For example, a word processor might define the standard size and location as wide enough to display a document whose width is specified in the Page Setup dialog. If the user invokes Page Setup to specify a wider or narrower document, the application might change the values for the standard size and location to reflect that change.  
Explicit dragging or resizing of the window is handled according to these guidelines, regardless of the presence or absence of the zoom window feature. The effect of dragging or resizing depends on the state of the window and the degree of movement. In the Macintosh computer, the user must drag or resize a window at least seven pixels to cause a change in the user—selected state.
