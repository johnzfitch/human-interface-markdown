The range selection method can be applied to text. The user selects a range of text by dragging through the range. A range can be a range of characters, words, lines, or paragraphs, as defined by the application. If the user extends the range, the way the range is extended depends on what kind of range it is. If it's a range of individual characters, it can be extended one character at a time. If it's a range of words (including a single word), it's extended only by whole words.  
The user selects a whole word by double-clicking somewhere within that word. If the user begins a double-click sequence, but then drags the mouse between the mouse-down and the mouse-up of the second click, the selection becomes a range of words. As the pointer moves, the application highlights or unhighlights whole words at a time.
