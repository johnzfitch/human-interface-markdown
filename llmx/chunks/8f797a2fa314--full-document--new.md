#### New

The New command opens a new, untitled document for the current application. The user names the document the first time it's saved. If you detect that there isn't enough memory available to open another untitled window when the user chooses this command, display a dialog box that explains why the user can't open another window and suggest a solution. As described in Chapter 5, "Windows," which begins on page 131, always title the first new window "untitled." Some specialized applications require documents to be named when the user creates them. For example, if you are developing a database application, you can display the standard file dialog box for saving documents so that the user can name and save the database document upon creation. For more information on displaying default window titles, see Chapter 5. Figure 4-62 shows the New command and its result.
