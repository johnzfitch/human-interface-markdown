**Installer** A utility program that users can use to update system software or add resources.  
**invert** To highlight by changing white pixels to black and vice versa.  
**keyboard equivalent** Keystrokes that invoke a menu item from the keyboard. A keyboard equivalent is usually the combination of a modifier key and a character key.  
**keyboard layout** Software that specifies the mapping of keys on a physical keyboard to character codes.  
**Keyboard menu** A menu, located between the Help menu and the Application menu icons in the menu bar, that contains script system, keyboard layout, and input method items. It appears when more than one script system is installed and enabled or when a localizable flag is set.  
**keyboard shortcut** A keystroke that you can use instead of a mouse action to perform a task. For example, pressing the Command and the X keys at the same time is the same as choosing the Cut command from the Edit menu.  
**little arrows** A control, consisting of two arrows pointing in opposite directions, that allows users to increase or decrease values in a series by clicking or pressing the arrows.  
**localization** The process of adapting software to a particular region, language, and culture. Script and language adaptations are necessary but not sufficient for this process. Localization also includes date and time formats, number formats, text behavior formats, keyboard resources, and fonts.  
**locked file** A file whose data cannot be changed.  
**Macintosh Operating System** The combination of ROM-based and disk-based routines that together perform basic tasks such as starting the computer, moving data to and from disks and peripheral devices, and managing memory space in RAM.  
**Macintosh user interface** The standard conventions for interacting with Macintosh computers. The interface ensures users a consistent means of interacting with all Macintosh computers and the applications designed to run on them.  
**main event loop** In a standard Macintosh application program, a loop that repeatedly calls the Event Manager to get events and then responds to them as appropriate.  
**mainstreaming programs** Educational programs in which children with special needs (including those with physical disabilities) are included in "mainstream" classes with children who don't necessarily have special needs.  
**menu** A list of choices presented by a program. In the desktop interface, menus appear when users point to and press menu titles in the menu bar. Dragging through the menu and releasing the mouse button while a command is highlighted chooses that command.  
**menu bar** The horizontal strip at the top of the screen that contains menu titles.  
**menu item** A choice in a menu, usually a command to the current application.  
**menu title** A word, a phrase, or an icon in the menu bar that designates a menu. Pressing on the menu title causes the title to be highlighted and its menu to appear below it.  
**modal dialog box** A dialog box that puts the user in the state or "mode" of being able to work only inside the dialog box. (A modal dialog box resembles an **alert box.**) The user cannot move a modal dialog box, and the user can dismiss it only by clicking its buttons. Compare **modeless dialog box** and **movable modal dialog box.**  
**modeless dialog box** A **dialog box** that looks like a document window without a size box or scroll bars. The user can move a modeless dialog box, make it inactive and active again, and close it like any document window. Compare **modal dialog box** and **movable modal dialog box.**  
**modifier key** A key on a keyboard that changes the behavior or action of a character key when pressed at the same time as the character key. A modifier key can also change or accentuate the meaning of a mouse action. Compare **character key.**  
**movable modal dialog box** A modal dialog box that has a title bar (with no close box) that allows the user to move the dialog box. Compare **modeless dialog box.**  
**monitor** See **video monitor.**  
**monochrome monitor** A monitor capable of displaying in only one color.  
**mouse button** The button on the top of the mouse. In general, pressing the mouse button initiates some action on whatever is under the pointer, and releasing the button confirms the action.  
**Mouse Keys** An Easy Access feature that lets users use keys on the numeric keypad to control the pointer.  
**mutually exclusive attribute group** A group of attributes of which only one attribute can be in effect at any time. For example, the Left, Center, and Right commands in a graphics menu are a set of three commands, only one of which can be in effect at any time. (In dialog boxes, mutually exclusive attributes are represented by radio buttons.) Compare **accumulating attribute group.**  
**network** A collection of interconnected, individually controlled computers, together with the hardware and software used to connect them. A network allows users to share data and peripheral devices such as printers and storage media, to exchange electronic mail, and so on.  
**operating system** Low-level software that controls a computer by performing basic tasks such as input/output, memory management, and interrupt handling.  
**Option key** A modifier key that gives a different meaning or action to another key or to a mouse action.  
**outline fon**t A collection of outline glyphs in a particular typeface and style with no size restriction. The Font Manager can generate thousands of point sizes from the same TrueType font. See also **TrueType font.**  
**outline triangle** A control that allows users to view the contents of a folder without opening it. (The triangles appear when the user chooses to view the contents of their file system in a list view.)  
**output** Information transferred from a computer to some external destination, such as the display screen, a disk drive, a printer, or a modem. Compare **input.**  
**output device** A device that receives information from the microprocessor. The monitor is the Macintosh computer's primary output device. Compare **input device.**  
**palette** The name for a **tear-off menu** when it's been torn off. A palette remains visible on the screen so you can use it without having to pull down the menu. A palette can also be part of a window that provides tools or choices such as colors or patterns.  
**password** A unique word or set of characters used to ensure security. For example, a user enters a password to log on to a volume on a file server.  
**paste** To place the contents of the Clipboard whatever was last cut or copied—at the insertion point.  
**peripheral card** A removable printed-circuit board that plugs into one of the computer's expansion slots, allowing the computer to use a peripheral device or to perform some subsidiary or peripheral function.  
**peripheral device** A piece of hardware—such as a video monitor, disk drive, printer, or modem—used in conjunction with a computer and under the computer's control. Peripheral devices are often (but not necessarily) physically separate from the computer and connected to it by wires, cables, or some other form of interface. Such devices sometimes require peripheral cards.  
**pixel** Short for *picture element;* the smallest dot you can draw on the screen. Also a location in video memory that corresponds to a point on the graphics screen when the viewing window includes that location. In the Macintosh monochrome display, each pixel can be either black or white, so it can be represented by a bit; thus, the display is said to be a bitmap. For color or gray-scale video, several bits in RAM may represent the image. Thus, the display is not a bitmap but rather a pixel map.  
**pixel map** A set of values that represents the positions and states of the set of pixels making up an image.  
**point** (1) A unit of measurement for type. Twelve points equal 1 pica, and 6 picas equal 1 inch; thus, 1 point equals approximately 1⁄72 inch. (2) The intersection of a horizontal grid line and a vertical grid line on the coordinate plane, defined by a horizontal and a vertical coordinate.
