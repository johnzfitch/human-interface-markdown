- Are questions in dialogs posed in a straightforward and positive way—for example, "Do you want to erase everything on the disk named "Macintosh HD?" rather than "Do you not want to alter the contents of this disk?"
- Do you use sheets for document-specific dialogs?
- Are dialogs designed with a centered look (rather than flush left)?
- Are dialogs horizontally centered either on the screen or over the active window if the window is on a large screen or on a screen other than the one the menu bar appears on?
- Do you use modal dialogs only when necessary? If a movable modal dialog is displayed, can the application run in the background? Can the system Help menu be used when a modal dialog is displayed?
- If there is an active text input field in a modal dialog, can the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo menu commands in the Edit menu be used?
- Do keyboard equivalents of the standard Edit menu commands operate correctly in a modal dialog containing editable text items?
- Do you use the new data browser control for lists?
- Can type selection be used in scrolling lists? Can the arrow keys be used to move the selection by one item in the direction of the arrow?
- Does the active area of a dialog (the "focus") have an indicator if there is more than one possible focus? (Focus areas are those that accept keyboard input.)
- Does pressing the Tab key cycle through the available elements? Does Shift-Tab cycle in the reverse direction?
- When appropriate, are buttons named with a verb that describes the action that it performs, such as Erase, rather than OK?
- Do you provide a Cancel button wherever possible, especially in progress dialogs? Does pressing Escape or Command-period indicate Cancel? (Pressing Escape should never cause the user to lose information.)
