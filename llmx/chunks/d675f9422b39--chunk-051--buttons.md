#### **Buttons**  
A **button** is a small screen object usually labeled with text. Clicking or pressing a button performs the action described by the button's label. Button labels should be unambiguous. Often, a label describing the *result* of pressing the button ("Erase," "Revert," or "Don't Save" for example) is clearer than just "Yes," "No," or "OK." If one button the default button (that is, if pressing Return or Enter has the same result as pressing this button), then it is doubly outlined to distinguish it from the other buttons.  
Buttons usually perform instantaneous actions, such as completing operations defined by a dialog box or acknowledging error messages. They can also perform continuous actions, in which case the effect of *pressing* on the button (rather than just clicking it) would be the same as the effect of clicking it repeatedly.  
Two particular buttons, OK and Cancel, are especially important in dialogs and alerts. They're discussed under "Dialogs" and "Alerts."
