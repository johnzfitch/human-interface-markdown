- Can arrow keys be used in all text boxes (including in dialogs)? Can the Shift key be used with the arrow keys to extend the selection (including in dialogs)?
- If text is selected, does pressing an arrow key cause the insertion point to go to the corresponding end of the range and deselect it?
- Are discontinuous selections made with the Command key modifier (for lists and arrays)? The Shift key is used for graphics selections and continuous text extensions.
- Do you use Command–arrow key and Option–arrow key for moving the insertion point in larger semantic units? (Note that when multiple script systems are available, Command–Left Arrow and Command–Right Arrow are intercepted by the system and used for changing the keyboard layout.)
- Does the active font size in a menu have a checkmark next to it?
- Do you avoid making assumptions about font sizes? For example, the system font may have a different size in other countries.
