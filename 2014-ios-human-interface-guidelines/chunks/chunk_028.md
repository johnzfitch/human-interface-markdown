Inputting information takes time and attention, whether people tap controls or use the keyboard. When an app slows people down by asking for a lot of user input before anything useful happens, people can feel discouraged from using it.  
**Make it easy for users to make choices.** For example, you can use a picker or a table view instead of a text field, because most people find it easier to select an item from a list than to type words.

**Getinformation from iOS, when appropriate.** People store lots of information on their devices. When it makes sense, don't force people to give you information that you can easily find for yourself, such as their contacts or calendar information.  
**Balance a requestforinput by giving users something useful in return.** A sense of give and take helps people feel they're making progress as they move through your app.
