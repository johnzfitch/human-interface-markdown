Go ahead and brainstorm here. At this point, you're trying to capture all the tasksrelated to your main product idea. Don't worry if your list is long; you'll narrow it down later.  
For example, imagine that your initial idea is to develop an app that helps people shop for groceries. As you think about this activity, you come up with a list of related tasks (potential features) that users might be interested in, such as:  
- Creating lists
- Getting recipes
- Comparing prices
- Locating stores
- Annotating recipes
- Getting and using coupons
- Viewing cooking demos
- Exploring different cuisines
- Finding ingredient substitutions
