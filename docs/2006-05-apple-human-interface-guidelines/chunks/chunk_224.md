<span id="page-176-3"></span>As a developer or a designer, you should be aware of four main types of windows. Although their behavior is generally the same, they have important differences.  
- **Document windows** contain file-based user data. They present a viewinto the content that people create and store. If the document is larger than the window, the window shows a portion of the document's contents and provides users with the ability to scroll to other areas.
- **Application windows** are the mainwindows of applications that are not document-based. These windows can use the standard Aqua window look and features or (less frequently) the brushed metal look.
- **Utility windows** float above other windows and provide tools or controls that users can work with while documents are open. Utility windows (also called palettes) are discussed in more detail in "Utility [Windows"](#page-201-0) (page 202).
- **Dialogs and alerts** require a response from the user. These are discussed in ["Dialogs"](#page-206-1) (page 207).  
Examples of all of these types of windows are shown in Figure 13-1.
