#### End

Pressing End is the opposite of pressing Home: it's equivalent to moving the scroll boxes all the way to the bottom of the vertical scroll bar and to the right end of the horizontal scroll bar. (Note that the End key may operate differently in a spreadsheet application; it won't necessarily scroll horizontally and it may scroll to the end of a row or to the end of the spreadsheet itself.) *Pressing End has no effect on the location of the insertion point or any selected material.*
