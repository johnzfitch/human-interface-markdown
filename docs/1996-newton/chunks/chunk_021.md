In addition to seeing the results of their actions, users need immediate feedback when they operate controls and ongoing status reports during lengthy operations. Have your application respond to every user action with some visible change. For example, make sure every button highlights when a user taps it. Audible feedback also helps, but can't be the primary or sole feedback because people may use Newtons in places where they can't hear or where they must turn off the sound.  
The system automatically provides feedback when it's temporarily busy by displaying the busy cursor. During operations that last more than a few seconds, your application should display explanatory messages and show elapsing progress.
