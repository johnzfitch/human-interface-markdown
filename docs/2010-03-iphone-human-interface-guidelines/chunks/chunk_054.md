Communication and feedback are as important in iPhone applications as they are in desktop computer applications. Users need to know whether their requests are being processed and when their actions might result in data loss or other problems. That said, it's also important to avoid overdoing communication by, for example, alerting the user to conditions that aren't really serious or asking for confirmation too often.  
Animation is a great way to communicate effectively, as long as it doesn't get in the way of users' tasks or slow them down. Subtle and appropriate animation can communicate status, provide useful feedback, and help users visualize the results of their actions. Excessive or gratuitous animation can obstruct the flow of your application, decrease its performance, and annoy users.  
In all your text-based communication with users, be sure to use user-centric terminology; in particular, avoid technical jargon in the user interface. Use what you know about your users to determine whether the words and phrases you plan to use are appropriate. For example, the Wi-Fi Networks preferences screen uses clear, nontechnical language to describe how the device connects to networks, as shown in Figure 3-4.
