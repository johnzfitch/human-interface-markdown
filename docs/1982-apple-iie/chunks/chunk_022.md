Actual speed of operations is important, but perceived speed is even more important. It may seem important to conserve keystrokes, but it is more important to conserve "brain strokes" and design the interface so that there is a natural flow. A more important goal is to reduce the amount of unproductive time, which is time spent deciding how to perform the desired task rather than time spent performing the task. This concern should permeate the entire design process.  
React to user's input immediately. A user will interpret any delay of more than a few tenths of a second after he has pressed RETURN to mean  
that either the program or the user has made an error. If you need to make a computation, first acknowledge that you have accepted the input.  
In training or educational software, it is doubly important to react immediately to test questions. The greatest retention of knowledge occurs when response occurs either within one second or not until the end of the entire test. Apparently, waiting five to ten seconds for a correct/not correct judgement is so frustrating that people lose involvement with what is going on.
