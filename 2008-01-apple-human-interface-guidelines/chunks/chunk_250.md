**Important:** Scope buttons are designed to be used in scope bars and related filter rows only. They are not intended to be used in the toolbar or bottom-bar areas or outside of a scope bar in the window body.  
The recessed scope button style is used to display types or groups of objects or locations the user can select to narrow the focus of a search or other operation. For example, Dictionary displays recessed scope buttons that allow users to look up a word in a dictionary, a thesaurus, an Apple terminology database, Wikipedia content, orin all locations simultaneously.Figure 15-12 shows the recessed scope buttons used in Dictionary.

The round rectangle scope button style is used to allow users to save a set of search criteria and to change or set scoping criteria. For example, the Finder uses round rectangle scope buttons to display search criteria, such as creation and last opened dates, and to provide a save search button. Figure 15-13 shows the round rectangle scope buttons used in the Finder.

#### Scope Button Contents and Labeling  
Typically, round rectangle and recessed scope buttons contain text, but they can instead contain images. If you want to display an image in a scope button, be sure to consider the system-provided images before you spend time designing your own. If you decide to design a custom icon for use in a scope button, see "Designing Icons for [Rectangular-Style](#page-153-2) Toolbar Controls" (page 154) for some guidelines.
