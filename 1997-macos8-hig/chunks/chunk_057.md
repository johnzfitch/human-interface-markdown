In dialog boxes, you should place push buttons in locations that are functional and consistent—consistent both within your particular application and across other applications that you develop. Note that standard alert boxes will place any buttons automatically.  
The default button is not necessarily the button in the lower-right corner; it should be the one for the action that the user is most likely to want to perform. If this choice was "Cancel", for example, the default button would be on the left side of the dialog box. See ["Default Buttons" \(page 23\)](#page-22-0), for more information on assigning the default button.  
#### **Note**  
The resource rectangle of a push button is the same size as its visual dimensions.  
The standard height of a push button is 20 pixels. Don't count the default ring when measuring the size or alignment of push buttons. The default ring (which is outset 3 pixels from the button) is an attribute and does not affect the base resource size.  
To determine the width of a push button that is not a standard one such as the OK button or the Cancel button, add a minimum of 8 pixels between the ends of the text string and the outside line of the button on each side, not including  
<span id="page-72-0"></span>the black border. Figure 3-16 shows a button with the correct spacing at each end of the text.

The standard size for the OK and Cancel buttons is 20 pixels by 58 pixels. Figure 3-17 shows the OK button.

In general, it's best to make a set of push buttons all the same size, as determined by the width of the longest button name. When you stack push buttons vertically, center the text, as shown in [Figure 3-18.](#page-73-0)  
When you stack push buttons vertically, leave 10 pixels between each button. [Figure 3-18](#page-73-0) shows this spacing. Recall that you don't count the default ring of a push button, which is an attribute that does not affect the resource size.

When you place push buttons horizontally, leave 12 pixels between the buttons. Figure 3-19 shows this spacing.

You should also leave 12 pixels between the edge of a push button and any applicable edge of a dialog box.
