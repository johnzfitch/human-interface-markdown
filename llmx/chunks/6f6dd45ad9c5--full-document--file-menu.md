## File Menu

The **File menu** provides commands that pertain to housekeeping tasks for documents. It also contains the Quit command. All of the standard operations are described here. If you add additional commands to the File menu, be sure that they fit the category of taking care of documents. Figure 4-61 shows a sample File menu.
