The computer must communicate in plain language. Don't use computer jargon that impresses or intimidates more than it informs or clarifies. Because the desktop interface doesn't support traditional system prompts, and because most of its actions are determined when the user selects from available possibilities, there is seldom need for many words. When words are needed, it usually happens in dialog boxes, when the user is asked to choose among alternatives or to acknowledge a situation.  
#### The Screen  
All interactions between user and application take place in the context of the screen. Though it does not represent a functional description of the Apple Desktop Interface, the screen is the stage on which the interactions are made visible. The programmer's task is to make the screen to mirror ongoing activities, to make explicit which actions are possible, and to make clear the consequences of any particular action.
