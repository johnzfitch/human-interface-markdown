## The Active Window

Of all the windows that are open on the desktop, the user can work in only one window at a time. This window is called the active window. All other open windows are inactive. Things can be happening to documents in inactive windows, but the user can work only with the active window. For example, if the user chooses Close from the File menu, only the active window is closed.

To make a window active, the user clicks anywhere in it. Making a window active has two immediate consequences:

- The window changes its appearance. Its title bar is highlighted. The scroll bars, close box, zoom window box, and size box appear.
- The window "moves" to the frontmost plane, so that parts that had been covered by other windows become visible.

Clicking in an inactive window does nothing except activate it. To make a selection within the window, the user must click again. When the user clicks in a window that has been deactivated, the window should be reinstated just the way it was when it was deactivated, with the scroll box in the same position and the same selection highlighted.

When a window becomes inactive, the visual changes that took pl.ace when it was activated are reversed. The title bar becomes unhighlighted. The scroll bars, close box, zoom window box, and size box disappear. Although the information within the window remains visible (except where obscured by other windows), any selection i3 deselected. Figure 39 shows the vis~al difference between active and inactive windows.
