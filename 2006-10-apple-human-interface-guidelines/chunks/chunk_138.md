To select a single field (cell), the user clicks in it. The user can also select a field by moving to it with the Tab or Return key.  
To select part of the contents of a field, the user must first select the field, then click again to select a part.  
A user should be able to quickly select a row or column in a table—for example, clicking a column headingshould select the column. Tables can also support Command-clickfor selecting discontinuous fields.  
Pressing the Tab key cycles through the fields in an order determined by your application, and Shift-Tab navigates in the opposite direction. Typically, the sequence is from left to right, then from top to bottom. Pressing Tab from the last field selects the first field.
