Safari on iOS provides the interface for browsing web content on iOS-based devices. Although Safari on iOS is similar in many ways to Safari on the computer desktop, it is not the same.  
For the most part, users can't change the size of the **viewport** (the area that displays content). On the desktop, users resize the viewport when they resize the browser window. On iOS-based devices, the viewport does not resize unless the device orientation changes. iOS users can change the scale of the viewport by zooming in and out, and they can pan the webpage. On iPad, users are much less likely to zoom web content than they are on iPhone (shown below).

Safari on iOS supports cookies. Use of cookies can streamline user interaction with web content by saving the user's context, preferences, and previously entered data.  
Safari on iOS does notsupport Flash, Java (including Java applets), or third-party plug-ins within web content. Instead, Safari on iOS supportsthe HTML5 <audio> and <video> tagsto provide audio and video streaming, and JavaScript and CSS3 transforms, transitions, and animations to display animated content.

Platform Characteristics  
Safari on iOS interprets most gestures astargeting the way the device displays content, not the content itself. The tap, which is analogous to a single mouse click, can cause Safari on iOS to send the onclick event to a webpage. There are no analogs for other mouse-based gestures, such as hover.  
Safari on iOS allows web apps to run in full-screen mode. Web apps that launch from a web clip icon on the user's Home screen can hide the UI for Safari on iOS, so that they look more like native applications.
