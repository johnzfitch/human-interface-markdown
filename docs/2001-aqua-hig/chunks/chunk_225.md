Traditionally, a document icon looks like a piece of paper with its top-right corner folded down. As previously suggested, Aqua document icons should make it obvious which application they are associated with. Preview documents, for  
Types of Icons **197**  
example, include a graphic of the media (the pictures) used in the application icon. For simplicity and to avoid confusing the document with the application itself, the viewing tool is not repeated in the document icon.

Document icons are presented as if they are hovering on the desktop, with the shadow behind the document. For more information, see ["Icon Perspectives"](#page-201-3) [\(page 202\).](#page-201-3)  
In cases where you want to put an identifying badge over a document icon, treat the badge as an integrated element within the document, instead of putting it over the top of the base image and breaking out of the overall document shape.
