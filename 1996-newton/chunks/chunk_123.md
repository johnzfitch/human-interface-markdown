Icons for Newton applications generally should not look like icons for desktop computer applications. Boxy icons are common on desktop computers, where colors and shades of gray can distinguish one icon from another. In the Newton Extras Drawer, boxy black-and-white icons look too much alike, especially when they are in great number or are uniform in size. Try to give your Extras Drawer icon a distinguishing silhouette. If for some reason your design must use a black rectangular field, eliminate a pixel in each corner to make the icon more rounded. A rounded icon looks more Newtonlike.
