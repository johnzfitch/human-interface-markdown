- If an operation can be halted midstream, with possible side effects, is the button named Stop instead of Cancel?
- Do the Return and Enter keys map to the default button, which is usually the button with the safest result or the most likely response?
- Do default buttons have color and pulse?
- Are buttons wide enough to accommodate their text names?
- Are buttons placed in functional and consistent locations, both within your application and across all applications that you develop? Is the action button placed in the lower-right corner with the Cancel button to its left or above (for Western readers)?
- Are hidden filename extensions supported? Does the application display a file's display name instead of its filename, and does the Save dialog support filename extension hiding?
- Do Save dialogs place a default name in the Save As text field, and is the name (but not its filename extension) selected?
- When a dialog refers to a document or an application, do you use the name of the document or application in the message text?
- Has room been left to allow the dialog to grow during localization? Most languages require more characters than English to convey equivalent messages.
- <span id="page-267-1"></span>■ Are the bounding rectangles of interface elements (for example, radio buttons and checkboxes) the same size? When the alignment of dialog elements is reversed, they should align on the opposite side.
