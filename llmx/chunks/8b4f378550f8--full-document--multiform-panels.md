## **Multiform Panels**

A multiform panel is a panel that has a pop-up list or set of graphical radio buttons at the top that lets the user choose which form the panel takes. For example, the following panel lets the user choose anyone of seven different forms.

Multiform panels conserve screen space by combining many related panels into a single panel. Since all their contents aren't visible all the time, multiform panels shouldn't be used for an application's most basic functionality.
