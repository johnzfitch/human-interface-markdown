<span id="page-143-2"></span>A **group box** is used to associate a set of related items—such as radio buttons or pop-up menus—in a dialog.  
As much as possible, *use additional space between controls to create groups of controls, rather than group boxes.* Excessive use of group boxes creates visual clutter; too many lines and edges can distract users. Also use space or separator lines, rather than secondary group boxes, for subgroupings. The following figures show examples of how to successfully re-create dialogs using space rather than group boxes. When space alone isn't enough to clearly divide areas, use a label and a separator, as shown in the following "after" examples.  
Within a group box, no control or label should be positioned within 16 pixels of the box's top, bottom, left, or right borders.  
Group boxes can be untitled or titled. Titles can be static text, a checkbox label, or text in a pop-up menu.
