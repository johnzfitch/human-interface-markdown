<span id="page-35-2"></span>An adaptable program is one that adjusts appropriately to its surroundings; that is, it does not stop working when the current conditions change. If a network connection goes down, an adaptable program lets the user continue to work offline. Similarly, if certain resources are locked or become unavailable, an adaptable program finds other ways to meet the user's request.  
One of the strengths of Mac OS X is its ability to adapt to configuration changes quickly and easily. For example, if the user changes a computer's network configuration from System Preferences, the changes are automatically picked up by applications such as Safari and Mail, which use CFNetwork to handle network configuration changes automatically.  
<span id="page-35-3"></span>Here are some guidelines to keep in mind as you design your software to be adaptable:  
- Build forgiveness and intelligence into your interface. Make sure your software can handle cases in which a file-system volume or the network disappears. Offer the user an option for saving files to a different volume or reconnecting to the network later.
- <span id="page-35-7"></span>■ Avoid making assumptions about available hardware and access to that hardware. Hardware configurations can vary greatly based on the computer, country, and user. For example, not every Macintosh is equipped with Velocity Engine on the processor. Similarly, not all keyboards have the same set of keys. Hardware can also be added or removed at runtime. Use the I/O Kit interfaces to detect available device configurations. See *Accessing Hardware From Applications* for more information.
- Avoid making assumptions based on the current user's locale. Be prepared to handle different date, time, and number formats. Also, don't assume that the address format of the current user is the only address format in use. For example, the user may store contacts with foreign addresses in Address Book.
- <span id="page-35-6"></span>■ Avoid making assumptions about your execution environment. If your program is running in a NetBoot environment, your access to the system resources may be limited or read-only. For example, in a typical NetBoot environment, only the user's home directory is writable.
- Be sensitive to changes in screen availability and resolution. Mac OS X supports hot-plugging of monitors and notifies applications of the changes through Quartz Services. Your software should respond appropriately by adjusting window locations and dimensions as described in ["Window](#page-183-0) [Behavior"](#page-183-0) (page 184).
- <span id="page-35-5"></span>■ Use modern system APIs. Apple works to ensure that its modern system APIs properly handle configuration changes. Although some legacy APIs may also support configuration changes, that support may change in future releases.
- <span id="page-35-4"></span><span id="page-35-1"></span>■ Avoid writing custom device drivers. The I/O Kit contains working drivers to support many standard protocols and device types. Relying on these drivers means your hardware should automatically work with each new version of Mac OS X.
