A **dialog** is a window that is designed to elicit a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog, for example—allow users to provide many responses at one time.  
OS X provides three main ways to present dialogs:  
- **Document modal.** A document-modal dialog preventsthe user from doing anything else within a particular document. The user can switch to other documentsin the app and to other apps. Document-modal dialogs should be sheets, which are described in "Using Sheets [\(Document-Modal](#page-215-0) Dialogs)" (page 216).
- **App modal.** An app-modal dialog prevents the user from interacting fully with the current app, although the user can switch to another app. An example of an app-modal dialog is the Open dialog (described in "The Open [Dialog"](#page-221-0) (page 222)).
- **Modeless.** A modeless dialog enables users to change settings in the dialog while still interacting with document windows. The Find window in many word processors is an example of a modeless dialog.  
In addition, OS X provides an alert, which is a special type of dialog that can be document modal or app modal. In general, if the error condition or notification appliesto a single document, the alert is document modal (that is, a sheet). If the alert applies to the state of the app as a whole, or to more than one document or window belonging to the app, the alert is app modal. For guidelines on when to use alerts and how to design them, see ["Alerts"](#page-235-0) (page 236).  
#### <span id="page-215-0"></span>Using Sheets (Document-Modal Dialogs)  
A **sheet**is a modal dialog that is attached to a particular document or window, preventing usersfrom interacting with the document or window until they dismiss the dialog. To avoid annoying users, you should use a sheet only when necessary.  
Because a sheet is attached to the window from which it emerges, users never lose track of which window the dialog applies to. The TextEdit "locked" dialog shown here is an example of a sheet.  
![](images/_page_215_Picture_5.jpeg)  
A sheet animates into view as if it were emerging from a window's toolbar (or title bar, if no toolbar is present). When a sheet opens on a window near the edge of the screen and the sheet is wider than the window it's attached to, the sheet causes the window to move away from the edge. When the sheet is dismissed, the window returns to its previous position.  
Only one sheet can be open for a window at any one time. If the user's response to a sheet causes another sheet to open for that document, the first sheet closes before the second one opens.  
In general, a sheet is a good way to present:  
- A modal dialog for an activity that is specific to a particular document, such as exporting, attaching files, or printing.
- A modal dialog that is specific to a single-window app that does not create documents. For example, a single-window utility app might use a sheet to request acceptance of a licensing agreement from the user.  
● Other window-specific dialogs that are typically dismissed by users before they proceed with their task.  
Follow the guidelines in this section to ensure that the sheets you display behave as users expect.  
**If necessary, display a sheet on top of any active panels that are related to the current document window.** However, if the user leaves a sheet open and clicks another document in the same app, the inactive window and its sheet should go *behind* any open panels.  
**Avoid using sheets if multiple open windows can show different parts of the same document at the same time.** A sheet is not useful in this situation, because it implies that the changes users make apply only to one portion of the document. In thistype ofsituation, it's better to use an app modal dialog to help users understand that changes in one window affect the content in other windows.  
**Use a sheet when multiple documents can appear in a single window at different times.** For example, a tabbed browser can display different documents in a single window at different times. A sheet is appropriate in this situation, even though it applies to only the document that is currently visible in the window. Because users must in effect dismiss the current document before viewing a different document in the same window, they should first dismiss the sheet.  
**Don't use a sheet if users need to see or interact with the window in order to address the dialog.** For example, if the dialog requests information that the user must get from the window, the dialog should not be a sheet. In this case, a modeless dialog would allow users to see or copy information in the window and apply it to the dialog.  
**Don't use a sheet for a modeless operation in which users need to observe the effects of their changes.** In this situation, a panel is a better choice because users can leave it open while they make changes to their content.  
<span id="page-216-0"></span>**Don't use a sheet on a window that doesn't have a title bar.** Sheets should emerge from a definite visual edge.  
#### Accepting and Applying User Input in a Dialog  
Because dialogs are small, transient UI elements, users don't expect to have in-depth interactions with them. Dialogs are most effective when they make it easy for users to input information and respond immediately to the changes users make.  
As you design a dialog, keep the following points in mind to help you make user interaction easy:  
- When appropriate, display default valuesfor controls and text fieldsso that the user can verify information rather than enter it from scratch.
- Display a selection or an insertion point in the first location that accepts user input—a text entry field or a list, for example.  
● When it provides an obvious user benefit, ensure that static text is selectable. For example, a user should be able to copy an error message, a serial number, or IP address to paste elsewhere.  
For the most part, changes that a user makes in a dialog should appear to take effect immediately. To support the appearance of immediate effect, you need to validate the information users enter and you need to decide when to apply their changes. The following guidelines can help you provide a good dialog experience.  
**As much as possible, do error checking as the user inputs information.** If you wait to check for errors until the user tries to dismiss the dialog, you might have to present an alert, which is not a good user experience. It's better to check for errors as soon as possible, because it allows users to fix the problem before they leave the context of the dialog.  
**Avoid validating input after each keystroke.** Too-frequent validation can annoy users and slow down your app. It's better to design your interface to automatically disallow invalid input. For example, your app could automatically convert lowercase characters to uppercase when appropriate.  
**Use the length of an operation to determine whetherto perform it automatically.** Sometimes, it's appropriate for your app to automatically perform an operation based on user input; other times, it's better when the user initiates the operation—for example, by clicking a button. In general, it's acceptable to automatically perform an operation that completes quickly and returns user control within a couple of seconds. For an operation that takes a longer time to execute, it's best to display an estimate of the time required to complete the operation and let the user initiate it.  
**Provide an Apply button when it makes sense.** An Apply button can be appropriate in a dialog that displays multiple settingsthat affect the user's view of data. In thissituation, an Apply button allowsthe user to preview the effect of the selected settings without committing to the changes.  
Be cautious about using an Apply button for operations that take a long time to implement or undo; it might not be obvious to users that they can interrupt or reverse the process. In particular, save dialogs or dialogs that allow users to make changes that can't be previewed easily should not include an Apply button.  
<span id="page-217-0"></span>**Don't use an Apply button to mean the same thing as the OK button.** In particular, clicking an Apply button should not dismiss a dialog because the user should first decide whether to accept the previewed changes (by clicking OK) or to reject them (by clicking Cancel). When the user dismisses the dialog without clicking OK, all previewed changes should be discarded.
