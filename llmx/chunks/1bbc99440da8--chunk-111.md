The **Application menu** displays a list of the applications that are currently running. When the user opens your application, its name and its small icon appear in the Application menu. Users can switch to another application by choosing an item in this menu. They can also hide the open windows of the active application or any other open applications. See Chapter 5, "Windows," which begins on page 131, for more information about how your application should behave when the user makes it the active application or when the user chooses another application while yours is active.
