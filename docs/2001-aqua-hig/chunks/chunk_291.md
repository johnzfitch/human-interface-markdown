- Do you provide help tags to help users identify interface elements?
- Are your help tags very brief? Do they describe what the user will accomplish by using the object?
- Do expanded help tags for a file display the filename extension, even if the user has chosen to hide it on that file?  
<span id="page-248-1"></span><span id="page-248-0"></span>This appendix describes usage guidelines for terms found in Mac OS X. For ease of use, it contains some terms from the *Apple Publications Style Guide*. For any item that contradicts an *APSG* entry, use the guideline provided here.  
For terms not included here, or for more information, see the *APSG* [\(http://](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/faq.html) [developer.apple.com/techpubs/faq.html](http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/faq.html)) and the *American Heritage Dictionary*.  
Apple has standard translations for some of these terms in other languages. Check <http://developer.apple.com/intl/localization.html>.  
Apple reserves the right to change terms and guidelines at any time.  
**abbreviations and acronyms:** Spell out the following on first use (on a page or in a document):  
ISP (Internet service provider) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  
You don't have to spell out *CD-ROM, HTML,* or *MIME*.  
**abort:** Don't use; use **cancel**.  
**Address Book:** Two words. An application, separate from Mail.  
**administrator:** Use to refer to people who can do such tasks as create users and groups, assign privileges to files and folders, and so on. Don't use **Owner**. You can say, for example, "You need to log in with an administrator password" or "Only administrator users can make changes." Don't shorten to "admin user."  
**analog-to-digital (adj.):** Note hyphens.  
**Apple key:** Don't use; the key with the cloverleaf and the Apple logo is "the Command key."  
**application:** It is not necessary to say "application program" on first use. (This entry is different from the current APSG.) "Application" is OK to use alone.  
**application menu:** The menu to the right of the Apple menu. Refer to it as "the [application name] application menu" ("the Mail application menu," "the Grab application menu").  
**application names:** Unless the official product name contains an internal cap, twoword application names should contain spaces, even if the filename in the file system appears without a space. Examples of correctly spelled names:  
Address Book  
Disk Utility  
Help Viewer  
Image Capture  
Key Caps  
Keychain Access  
NetInfo Manager  
Network Utility  
Print Center  
Process Viewer  
Script Editor  
Setup Assistant  
System Preferences  
TextEdit  
WorldText  
In general, don't use "the" with application names.  
*Correct:* Open QuickTime Player.  
*Incorrect:* Open the QuickTime Player.  
*Correct:* Open Print Center.  
*Correct:* Open the Print Center application.  
*Incorrect:* Open the Print Center.  
**the Applications folder:** There is only one, which is displayed when you click the Applications button in a Finder window.  
**Aqua:** Uppercase (an Apple trademark). Use mainly as an adjective ("the Aqua user interface").  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**attach:** Don't use to mean **connect** (as in "Connect your USB device to your computer").  
**boot:** Don't use for *start up* (except in technical documentation).  
**box:** Don't use "dialog box" anymore; OK to say "dialog."  
**bus-powered, self-powered:** Try to avoid when indicating whether devices draw power from a power cord or from another USB device. When possible, describe the device, don't give it a label: "A device that plugs into an electrical outlet" (instead of "a self-powered device"); "a device that gets its power from another USB device" (instead of "a bus-powered device").  
**button states:** In a dialog, the default button has color and pulses, but avoid references that say "blue"; call it "the default button." Window buttons "have color" or "don't have color"; don't refer to buttons as "clear."  
**canceled/canceling:** Note our style is one "l."  
**Carbon application:** Refers to an application written and compiled using the Carbon API specification interfaces (Universal Interfaces 3.3.2 or later). Don't say "Carbonized"; instead say something like "update your application for Carbon." The term "Carbon" should be used only in developer documentation.  
A Carbon application executes as a native process in Mac OS X if it is compiled as either a Mach-O or CFM/PEF binary, and can be a single file binary or application package. A Carbon application executes in Mac OS 8.1 to Mac OS 9.x with CarbonLib installed if it is compiled as a CFM-executable binary, as either a singlefile binary or an application package.  
**CD-ROM disc:** Don't shorten to "a CD-ROM." It's either "a CD-ROM disc" or "a CD."  
**chain:** OK to use when you mean a series of USB devices connected together. See **hierarchy**.
