This section contains specific terms that are often misused in user documentation for the Macintosh.  
#### Click 11  
Click is the action of positioning the pointer over an object and briefly pressing the mouse button. The user *clicks* objects, not *clicks on* objects. Thus your documentation should say  
- Click the disk icon.
- Click the Open button.
- Click Auto Page Numbering.  
It is OK to say *click in* a window, but the user *clicks* all other onscreen elements. Also, it's not appropriate to say *click and drag*. The user clicks or the user drags.  
#### Checkbox 11  
A checkbox is a standard Macintosh control that displays a setting, either checked (on) or unchecked (off); it appears as a square with label text next to it. The user *clicks* a checkbox, not *checks* a checkbox, to select or deselect the corresponding option. When the option is on, an *x* appears in the box. When the option is off, the box is empty.  
#### Document 11  
**Document** refers to a file the user creates and can open, edit, and print. HyperCard documents are called **stacks.** Use the term *document* in user-level documentation and avoid the use of the term *file*, because it is more technical and less well-defined.
