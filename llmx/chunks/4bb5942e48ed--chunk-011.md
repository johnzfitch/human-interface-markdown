<!-- Chunk 11 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 235 -->
Menus give the user access to the full breadth of an application's functionality. A user should be able to get a good idea of what an application does by looking at its menu commands. As shown below, the application's menu commands are grouped into a main menu and its submenus.

A keyboard alternative is a combination of keys that can be used instead of the mouse for choosing a command. To choose a command from the keyboard, the user holds down the Command key while typing the character shown in the menu command. For example, to quit, the user can either click the Quit menu command or hold down the Command key and press q.  
The main menu and many submenus are standard-in almost any application, they should have many of the same commands in the same order. Chapter 6, "Menus," describes the standard menus and commands, and gives guidelines on creating application-specific menus and commands.
