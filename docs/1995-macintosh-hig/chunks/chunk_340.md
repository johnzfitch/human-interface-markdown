- Do you always design for black and white first and then colorize your design?
- Are your black-and-white designs two-dimensional?
- Do you avoid using color as the only means of communicating important information?
- Are the colors carefully chosen? Are bright colors used sparingly and only in small areas? Do you use light or subtle colors for large areas?
- Do you maintain a close visual relationship between a black-and-white design and its colorized version?
- Do you use true gray instead of a 50 percent gray pattern when a color monitor is present?
- Do you use the Color Picker where appropriate?
- Do any custom elements, such as tool palettes or special window controls, follow the color scheme of the operating system? Do the colors get updated when the user changes the color in the Color control panel?
