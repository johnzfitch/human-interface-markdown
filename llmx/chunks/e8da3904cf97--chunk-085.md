Some characters are reserved for special purposes, but there are different degrees of stringency. Since almost every application has a File menu and an Edit menu, the keyboard equivalents in those menus are strongly reserved, and should never be used for any other purpose. All these equivalents may be selected while pressing the Open-Apple key. (All but Quit are also selectable while pressing the Control key, to enable touch-typists to manipulate the mouse while using these editing keys simultaneously):  
| Character | Command           |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Z         | Undo (Edit menu)  |
| X         | Cut (Edit menu)   |
| С         | Copy (Edit menu)  |
| V         | Paste (Edit menu) |
| Q         | Quit (File menu)  |  
The following Open-Apple combinations are reserved for the keyboard equivalents of mouse operations:  
| Character  | Command                                           |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| D          | Drag or move the currently active window          |
| G          | Grow or shrink (size) the currently active window |
| , <b>M</b> | Mark a selection                                  |  
One Open-Apple keyboard command doesn't have a menu equivalent:
