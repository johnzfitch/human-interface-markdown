<span id="page-83-4"></span>The content of some windows changes depending on the user's selection. For example, when the user clicks one of the icons at the top of the Mail Preferences window, the display at the bottom of the window changes. Some windows, such as Displays in System Preferences, switch panes using a **tab control** (see ["Tab](#page-131-0)  [Controls" \(page 132\)](#page-131-0)).  
<span id="page-84-6"></span>Windows with changeable panes should reopen in their previous state as long as the application is open, and return to their default views when the user quits. A tabbed window, for example, should open in its previous state until the user quits the application; the next time the user opens the window, its leftmost tab should be active.
