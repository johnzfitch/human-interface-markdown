People recognize objects more effectively than they can recall the same objects. In other words, they can say that they want a certain object, or they they have seen it before, better than they can *list* the same objects out of context. Further, when contextual cues are provided, both recognition and recall improve. The Apple Desktop Interface carefully provides a consistent visual context for events, and relies on recognition ("see-and-point") rather than on recall ("remember-and-type"). This lets mental activity focus on the task at hand rather than on remembering commands.  
This approach does not, however, dictate the display of all possible options at one time. In the current implementation of pull—down menus, most of the time most menu items are invisible to the user. The important thing is that they are immediately *accessible*.
