## **Commands that Bring Up Submenus**

Commands that bring up submenus usually begin with nouns, but verbs or adjectives are acceptable if they're clearer. Every submenu command in a menu should have a name that's clearly different from every other command in the menu, so that the user can guess what each submenu contains by its name. For example, it's a bad idea to have under the main menu both a Tools menu and a Utilities menu, since most users won't be able to remember which is which.

If a command brings up a menu of actions, it might be appropriate to have the command name the "target" of the actions. The Document menu uses this scheme: the Open command can be read as Open Document, the New command can be read as New Document, and so on.
