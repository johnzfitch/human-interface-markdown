<!-- Chunk 33 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 499 -->
Two major languages native to the Apple II and Apple III series computers are BASIC and Pascal. Each has an input routine as part of the language. These input routines are used in many programs, and your customers have become familiar with them. However, they are not particularly well suited to most professional applications. As a result, in the past, each software engineer has created her own routine, usually a variation of one or the other "standard" input routine. The direction of this creative technology has been toward more sophisticated input schemes which allow insertion and deletion of characters. This proliferation of inputs, each with its attendant cursor and special keys, has left the poor user rather bewildered.  
Enter The Three Cursors: New Apple owners are being trained to recognize and use three different inputs: BASIC's, Pascal's, and the new insert/delete input. They are being trained that they can tell what input they are faced with by the kind of cursor presented.  
BASIC uses the blinking box cursor which overlays a character. Pascal uses the solid box cursor which overlays a character. The new input uses a blinking underline cursor which lies between characters.  
Of all the standards being presented, this is the most important: The user should be able to tell the rules of the input from the kind of cursor being displayed. If everyone conforms to the use of the proper cursor for each personality of input (defined further below), Apple users will be relieved of a major source of frustration. It is really hard to concentrate on learning to do ellipsoid analysis of pork belly futures when you can't figure out what key to press to correct a typo.  
If you need additional features, then keep the original cursor and enable the original features: make your input scheme a superset of the original. If you need to use an entirely different kind of input scheme, please select a different cursor and train your users to recognize it as yet another entity.
