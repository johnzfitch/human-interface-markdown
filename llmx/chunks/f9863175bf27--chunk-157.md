The Application Kit has support for two kinds of button-list combinations: pop-up lists and pull-down lists. A pop-up or pull-down list is a window that comes to the screen when the user presses a button. The user can drag through the list to choose an option or action. The list stays on-screen only as long as the user keeps the mouse button down. Although pop-up lists and pull-down lists look similar, they have very different roles in the user interface.
