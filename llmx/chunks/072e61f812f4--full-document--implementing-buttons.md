## Implementing Buttons

When implementing any kind of button, you must make the following decisions:

- The end result of clicking the button
- The image or label (or both) on the button
- How the button's appearance changes during a click

Of course, before using a button, you should be sure that it's the best control for the job. "Choosing the Appropriate Control," at the end of this chapter, discusses which controls can be used for which types of functionality.
