The Caps Lock key latches in the down position when pressed and releases when pressed again. (On PowerBook computers this key is a soft switch, so it doesn't latch.) Note that the Caps Lock key operates for Roman languages only; in other words, it works as described in this section for languages that include uppercase and lowercase letters. When down, it gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys. Caps Lock has the same effect on alphabetic keys that the Shift key has, but Caps Lock has no effect on any other keys. In other words, even when Caps Lock is down, the user must press the Shift key to produce the upper characters (#, ?, and so on) on the nonalphabetic keys.  
#### Option 10  
The Option key, when used in combination with other keys, produces a set of international characters and special symbols. For example, in many Macintosh fonts, Option-4 produces the ¢ symbol, Option-R produces , and Option-G produces . Shift and Option can be used together, in combination with a character key, to produce yet other symbols. For example, Option-Shift-? produces the Spanish ¿ character. The Key Caps desk accessory lets the user preview these combinations in all available fonts.  
The Option key can also be used in conjunction with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. For example, in some graphics applications, if the user selects an object and holds down the Option key while dragging the object, the application makes a copy of the object and moves it to wherever the user releases the mouse button. This example is illustrated in Figure 10-11.
