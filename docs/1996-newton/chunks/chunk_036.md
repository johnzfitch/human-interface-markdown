The second step is to analyze the tasks people will be doing with your product. You need to do a task analysis for each task you anticipate that your users will do. Look at how they perform similar tasks without a Newton.

List each task a person might perform in that scenario, then break each task apart into its component steps. This allows you to identify each step that a person goes through in order to complete the task. Order the steps according to how people do them. When you feel you have all the steps listed and ordered, read the list back to someone and see if that person can use the steps you've listed to accomplish the task.
