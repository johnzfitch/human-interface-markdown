The best way to make sure your product meets the needs of your target audience is to show it to the kinds of people you hope will buy it. Do they understand what it's for and what to do with it? Can they use it? Can they keep track of where they are? Does it help them? You can do this during every phase of the design process to help reveal what works about your product as well as what needs improvement.  
When you give people an opportunity to use your product or a mock-up of it, they will inevitably find some undiscovered flaws. You can implement significant changes to your product during its evolution and thereby save yourself lots of time and money and save your users from frustration. By identifying and focusing on users' needs and experiences, you can create products that are easier to assemble, learn, and use. These improvements can translate into competitive advantages, increased sales, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
