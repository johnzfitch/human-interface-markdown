#### Needs:

- 1. The prompting and documentation need to be tutorial: the user must be guided into finding the necessary information to enter into the program, carrying out the kind of explorations with the program that will be most beneficial, and then suggest where the user should go from here.
- Clear content verification and error messages.
  "Unlikely" data should be confirmed by user. Help
  should be aimed toward problems in understanding the
  subject of taxes.
- 3. Appearance and use of accounting jargon. Non-professionals will be using this package. The vocabulary used on the display and in printed reports should be non-intimidating and not filled with accounting jargon.
- 4. User will probably use the program only a few times per year. There must be a minimum learning curve, even at the expense of reduced power and facility. A menu-driven format should certainly be considered as a first cut.
- 5. The user has to be asked for a lot of pre-computed figures: use an expression-evaluator input to allow them to add, subtract, multiply, and divide during input.

The designers had never considered who their audience was beyond their being "office workers," but when problems showed up during testing, they sat down and did a user profile. What they found was that there would be three separate users of the system:

- The data-entry persons. These folk would be proficient typists who initially would be expected to enter a great deal of pre-existing information. They might be temporary help, or they might be people who normally performed a different job. Their needs were for an interface that is quick to learn and easy to use.
- 2. The decision makers. These people would be expected to draw information from the system, both by calling up data on the display and by generating reports. They could be expected to be habitual users of the system: they could handle a long but gentle learning curve that would give them progressively more power.
- The key operators. These people are the ones who, in real life, read
  the manuals. They can be expected to spend some time with the
  system initially and can be expected to learn how to perform the
  more technical operation and maintenance tasks of the system.

Once the users of the system were identified, once their individual needs were identified, the designers were able to "unbalance" their equally-difficult interface, so that each user had a level of difficulty consistent with their skills and the amount of time they could spend learning the system.
