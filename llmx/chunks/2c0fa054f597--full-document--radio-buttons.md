#### Radio Buttons

It's best to provide separate balloons for selected, unselected, and unavailable radio buttons. For selected radio buttons, describe what the button does, beginning with a verb. At the end of the balloon, say that the button is selected. Figure 11-12 shows an example of this.

For an unselected radio button, describe what happens when you select the button. For example, you could say, "To align the objects at the left margin of the document, click this button." For a button that's not available, describe what the button does when selected using a sentence fragment beginning with a verb. Then explain why it is not available. For example, a balloon might say, "Aligns objects at the left margin of the document. Not available because no objects are selected."
