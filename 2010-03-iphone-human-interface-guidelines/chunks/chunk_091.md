<span id="page-71-2"></span>The toolbar displaystoolbar items equally spaced acrossthe width of the toolbar. It's a good idea to constrain the number of items you display in a toolbar, so users can easily tap the one they want. Remember that the hit-region of a user interface element is recommended to be 44 x 44 pixels, so providing five or fewer toolbar items is reasonable. Figure 6-9 shows an example of appropriate spacing of toolbar items in a toolbar.

The items in both [Figure](#page-71-1) 6-8 (page 72) and Figure 6-9 do not include a bezel. In iPhone OS this style is called the plain style. (For an example of the bordered style, look at the buttons in [Figure](#page-69-1) 6-7 (page 70).) Although you can use either the bordered or plain style for buttons in a toolbar, you should not mix both styles in the same toolbar.  
You can design your own icons for use in toolbar buttons, or you can take advantage of the predefined buttons iPhone OS provides. (See "Standard Buttons for Use in Toolbars and [Navigation](#page-123-0) Bars" (page 124) for more information on the buttons available to you.) If you choose to create custom toolbar buttons, be sure to make them as similar in size as possible to achieve a balanced, attractive appearance.
