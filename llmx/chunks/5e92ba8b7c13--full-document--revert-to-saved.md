### *Revert to Saved*

Revert to Saved discards all changes made to the active documentsince the last time it was saved or opened. The document on disk is reopened. Before all this happens, an alert box is used to confmn that this is what the user wants. (This follows the principles that users be allowed to make informed decisions and change their minds.)
