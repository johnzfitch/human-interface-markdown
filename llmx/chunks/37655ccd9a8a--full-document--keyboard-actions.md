# Keyboard actions

While the keyboard is not the focal point of human-computer interaction, it is required for entering text: naming objects and supplying the written content of documents. However, the user can choose commands, manipulate files, answer questions, and acknowledge communications without using the keyboard.

The keys on the keyboard are arranged in familiar typewriter fashion. There are two primary kinds of keys: character keys and modifier keys. A character key sends, to the computer, <sup>a</sup> character that then appears on the screen—much as <sup>a</sup> keystroke on <sup>a</sup> typewriter creates a character on a piece of paper.

A modifier key alters the meaning of <sup>a</sup> character key if the modifier key is held down while the character key is pressed. Modifier keys also sometimes affect the way the mouse click is interpreted. Modifier keys include the Shift, Option, Caps Lock, Control, and Apple (or Command) keys. Not all Apple keyboards contain all of these keys.

One modifier key, the Apple or Command key, allows users to perform some operations—operations that are usually available only through menus—from the keyboard. For example, in some applications, pressing Apple-Q is the equivalent of choosing Quit from the File menu. It is critical that these actions (called keyboard equivalents) be accessed in a consistent way. Each modifier key has a general meaning in all applications. Certain combinations of modifier key and character key are reserved for specific functions to ensure consistency. Some Apple keyboards also have other keys, such as arrow keys and function keys. See Chapter 3 for details.
