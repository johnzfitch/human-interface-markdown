# Palettes and Tear-Off Menus

- If a tool palette is present, is the selected symbol (icon, pattern, character, or drawing) highlighted?
- Do palettes provide tracking feedback when the mouse button is down?
- Does any change in selection in palettes occur only when the mouse button is released?
- If a menu has been torn off and moved, can the user still get access to it from the menu bar? When it is torn off a second time, does the first instance disappear?
- Do tear-off menus have a drag region with a 25 percent black-and-white pattern and a close box?
- Do tear-off menus always appear on top of open document windows?
