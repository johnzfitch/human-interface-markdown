Your application should always check whether the Option key is pressed at mouse-down. If it is, the semantics of the operation—a copy—remain in effect during the entire drag-and-drop operation, even if the user releases the Option key before dropping the item.  
If the user did not hold down the Option key at the beginning of the operation, you can check it again at drop time. This behavior gives the user the flexibility of making the move-or-copy decision at a later point in the drag-and-drop sequence. Pressing the Option key during the drag-and-drop sequence should not "latch" for the remainder of the sequence; check the state of the Option key at drop time if it was not pressed at mouse-down.  
**Note:** The Option key does not act as a toggle switch; Option-dragging between containers always initiates a copy operation. This guideline allows users to learn that Option means Copy.
