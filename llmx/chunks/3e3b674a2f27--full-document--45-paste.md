# 45. PASTE

This command replaces the active selection with the contents of the scrap folder. The contents of the scrap folder may be graphical or textual, however if the type of material does not correspond with what is allowed by the application, a warning sounds, and the Paste is not made. In many applications an explanation will appear in the Dialog Box.

After a paste of textual material, the selection is a caret located immediately after the material that was pasted into the document. If words or sentences are pasted, then spacing around the pasted text is made typographically correct.

When a Paste is done, the material in the scrap folder is unaltered. Repeated Pastes done without an intervening cut result in a number of copies of the material in the scrap folder being made.
