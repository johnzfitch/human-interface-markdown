#### *file package*

A folder that the Workspace Manager presents as a file, allowing the user to manipulate a group of files as if they were one file. A file package for an application executable should have the same name as the executable file, plus a ".app" extension. File packages for documents should bear the same extension as the one assigned to the application's document files.
