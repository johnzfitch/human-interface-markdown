## **Clicking**

The user *clicks* an object by positioning the cursor over it, then pressing and releasing a mouse button. Usually the mouse isn't moved during a click, and the mouse button is quickly released after it's pressed. However, timing generally isn't important. What's important is what object the cursor is over when the mouse button is pressed and released.

Clicking is used to pick an object or a location on the screen. If the object is a window, the click brings it to the front and may select it to receive characters from the keyboard. If the object is a menu command, button, or other control, the click performs the control's action. In text, a click selects the *insertion point* (the place where the user's typing will be entered). In a graphics editor, it may select the location for a Paste command.
