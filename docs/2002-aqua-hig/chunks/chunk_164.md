Dragging means pressing the mouse button, moving the mouse to a new position, and releasing the mouse button. The uses of dragging include selecting blocks of text, choosing a menu item, selecting a range of objects, moving an icon from one place to another, and shrinking or expanding an object.  
Dragging a graphic object should move the entire object (or a transparent representation of it), not just the object's outline.  
Your application can restrict an object from being moved past certain boundaries, such as the edge of a window. If the user drags an object and releases the mouse button outside the boundary, the object stays in the original location. If the user drags the item out of the boundary and then back in before releasing the mouse button, the object moves to the new location. Your application can also automatically scroll a document if the user moves an object beyond the boundary of a window (see ["Automatic Scrolling" \(page 87\)\)](#page-86-0).
