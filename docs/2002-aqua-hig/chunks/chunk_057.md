Standard Aqua system menus and submenus are sticky: When a user clicks the menu title, the menu stays open without the user having to continue holding down the mouse button. The user can then move the pointer to an item to select it. In Mac OS X, once a menu is opened with a click, it remains open until another action forces it to close. Such actions include  
- moving the pointer to another menu title
- a click elsewhere
- <span id="page-50-4"></span>■ a system-initiated alert
- a system-initiated application switch or quit
