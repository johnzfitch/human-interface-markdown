1. A Classic application is one originally created for Mac OS 9 (or earlier) that has not been rewritten for Carbon. More specifically, a Classic application is one written and compiled to the Mac OS Universal Interfaces prior to versions including the Carbon API specification interfaces (version 3.3.1 or earlier). Classic applications are single-file binaries containing both executable code and Resource Manager code components in the Preferred Executable Format (PEF) used by the Code Fragment Manager. In Mac OS X, Classic applications execute in the **Classic environment**.  
2. A pane in System Preferences for automatically starting up the Classic environment.  
**Classic application/Classic environment:** Don't refer to "the Classic application" (Classic.app); instead say, for example, "When you open a Classic application, the Classic environment starts up."  
**Classic Mac OS:** Avoid; instead say "Mac OS 9 and earlier" or whatever is applicable. ("Classic" describes applications, not the operating system.)  
**Clipboard:** The correct term in user documentation; don't use "pasteboard" or "scrap" in user documentation. In developer documentation, it's OK to use "pasteboard" when discussing the NSPasteboard class, but point out that users view the contents of the pasteboard in the Clipboard.  
**close button:** The leftmost (red) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar.  
**Cocoa application:** Refers to an application written and compiled using the Cocoa API frameworks. The term "Cocoa" should be used only in developer documentation.  
Cocoa applications written in Objective-C and C are compiled into Mach-O binaries and application packages, and execute as native processes in Mac OS X. They cannot execute in Mac OS 9.x or earlier. Cocoa applications written in Java execute only in the Mac OS X Java VM environment.  
**column-view button:** The rightmost button in the view control.  
**connect:** Use to refer to the general act of hooking devices together. (Don't use "attach.") You can connect USB devices to a computer; you can connect computers to an Ethernet network. Use "plug in" to refer to the specific action of plugging a connector into a port.  
*Correct:* Connect the USB device to a power source.  
*Correct:* Plug the square end of the USB cable into the USB device.  
**Console:** An application that lets you see technical messages from Mac OS X and Mac OS X applications. Don't say "the Console"; "the Console application" is OK.  
**Darwin:** An operating system that includes some, but not all, of the components of Mac OS X. Darwin comprises the kernel plus the BSD libraries and commands essential to the BSD Commands application environment. The term "Darwin" doesn't appear in the Mac OS X interface.  
**Date & Time:** A pane in System Preferences.  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**dialog:** Use instead of "dialog box."  
**directory:** In user documentation, don't use directory when you can say folder.  
**disable:** Avoid in user documentation; say *dimmed* or *turned off* (or simply *off*).  
**disclosure button:** The triangle that reveals more options when clicked (not "the detail button"). You can also call it "the disclosure triangle."  
**Disk First Aid:** Has been replaced by Disk Utility. (But Disk First Aid may be included on the Mac OS X CD, in the Mac OS 9 section.)  
**Disk Utility:** Two words.  
**Dock:** Don't use as a verb. Items are "in the Dock," not "on the Dock."  
*Correct:* Click an icon in the Dock.  
*Correct:* Click the Mail application icon in the Dock.  
*Correct:* Click a minimized window in the Dock.  
*Correct:* To put a window in the Dock, click the minimize button.  
*Correct:* When an item is in the Dock… *Incorrect:* You can dock any window. *Incorrect:* When an item is docked ….  
**drawer:** A window that slides out from a parent window when you click a button or choose a command, such as the Mailbox button in Mail ("the Mailboxes drawer").  
**enable:** Avoid in user documentation; say available or turned on (or simply on) or selected.

**favorites toolbar:** Use to refer to the user-customizable area at the top of the System Preferences window.  
**filename:** One word. **file server:** Two words. **file sharing:** Two words. **file system:** Two words.  
**FireWire:** Apple's version of high-speed serial data link technology. IEEE 1394 is a synonym. Don't use i.LINK.  
**folders:** When referring to folders on a computer used by more than one person, you need to distinguish only the folders that are not accessible to all users. For example, the top-level (global) applications folder is "the Applications folder." An individual user's applications folder is "your Applications folder" or "a person's Applications folder."  
**Grab:** A screen-capture application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**Help Viewer:** Two words.  
**help tags:** Lowercase. Use instead of "Tool Tips" to refer to the instructional text that appears when the pointer hovers over an interface element in Mac OS X.  
**hierarchy:** Avoid this term when you mean a series of USB devices connected to one another (and to a computer) in a branching structure using hubs. Simply describe, if possible: "You can connect many USB devices to one computer using a series of hubs," or similar language.  
**home folder:** Always lowercase ("Each user gets his or her own home folder"); there is nothing actually called "the Home folder" (it's named with the user's name).  
**HomePage:** When you're referring to the iTool available at mac.com, it's one word with an internal cap.  
**hot-pluggable:** Try to avoid in user documentation.  
**hub:** FireWire hub or USB hub. See also **bus-powered, self-powered.**  
**icon-view button:** The leftmost button in the view control.  
**IEEE 1394:** Synonym for **FireWire**.  
**i.LINK:** Don't use. Use **FireWire.** i.LINK is Sony's version.  
**Image Capture:** Two words.  
**Internet service provider (ISP):** Spell out the first time this term appears on a help page or in a document. After that, it's OK to use the abbreviation.

**Language:** One of the tabs in the International pane of System Preferences.  
**log in (v.):** You log in to a computer or server (not log on). You log out, not off.  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**login items:** Items that open when you log in. In user documentation, it's preferable to use descriptive language (for example, "items that start up automatically") instead of this term.  
**Login Items:** One of the tabs in the Login pane of System Preferences.  
**login screen:** The dialog that appears when a new user logs in to Mac OS X.  
**Mac:** Avoid when referring generally to a Macintosh computer (it could be confused with more specific names such as "Power Mac" or "iMac"). Use "computer." You can, however, use "Mac" judiciously as an adjective ("the Mac desktop").  
**Mac Help:** The onscreen help for the Mac OS and hardware. The help system itself is Apple Help, but you shouldn't have to use that term in user documentation.  
**Mac OS Extended, Mac OS Standard:** Disk formats.  
**Mac OS 9:** Always use the full name; don't shorten to "OS 9" or "9." Note spacing between each "word." Don't say "Mac OS 8/9"; instead say "Mac OS 8 and 9."  
**Mac OS X:** Always say "Mac OS X"; don't shorten to "OS X" or "X." Note spacing.  
**Mail:** An application that comes with Mac OS X. Address Book is a separate application.  
**mailbox:** One word. In Mail, a mailbox is essentially a folder, which can contain messages (received email) and other mailboxes.  
**Mailbox:** The button you click in the Mail application to see the Mailboxes drawer (which slides out on the left or right).  
**mailboxes drawer:** In the Mail application, when you click the Mailbox button, the mailboxes drawer slides out. It displays your mailboxes.  
**mass storage (adj.):** No hyphen (as in "mass storage device").  
**maximize:** Don't use. Instead, say something like, "To make an item in the Dock active, click it."  
**menu bar:** Two words.  
**MIME format:** An email format (as opposed to plain text format). You don't have to spell it out.  
**minimize button:** The middle (yellow) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar. You click this button to put a window in the Dock.  
**minimized:** OK to use to describe a window in the Dock: "Windows in the Dock are minimized."  
**Mouse:** A pane in System Preferences.  
**Multiple Users:** Two words, capped. An application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**name server:** Two words.  
**Network:** A pane in System Preferences and an icon you see when you click the Computer button in a Finder window.  
**network time server:** Not capped, but "Network Time" (the tab in the Date & Time pane of System Preferences) is. So is Network Time Synchronization.  
**non-USB devices:** Use to refer to devices that don't use USB.  
**Owner:** Don't use. See **administrator**.  
**pane:** Use to refer to different views within a window (views that can be changed with a tab, a pop-up menu, a button, or by selecting an item, or views that change automatically, as in Installer). In most cases in user documentation, you can avoid using "pane" by describing how to get to a particular place: "Click System Preferences, click Network, click AppleTalk. . . ."  
Examples of how to use "pane":  
Type your name in the Login Window pane of Login preferences.  
Choose an item from the Configure pop-up menu in the TCP/IP pane of Network preferences.  
You can set a document's access privileges in the Privileges pane of the file's Info window.  
When you click Network in System Preferences, the TCP/IP pane appears. To display the AppleTalk pane, click the AppleTalk tab.  
Click the Workgroups tab, then click the Options tab and select "Check for email when members log in."  
You choose a workgroup storage volume and set options for the volume in the Volumes pane of the Workgroups pane.  
Make sure "Play audio CDs" is selected in the "Group members may" section of the Privileges pane of the Workgroups pane.  
You can specify an RGB default in the Document Profiles pane of ColorSync preferences.  
Note that each of the system preferences panes can be shortened to, for example, "Network preferences." See also **preferences.**  
**panel:** Don't use; see **pane** and **dialog.**  
**pasteboard:** Don't use in user documentation. OK to use in developer documentation that discusses the NSPasteboard class, but point out that users view the contents of the pasteboard in the Clipboard.  
**pathname:** Most user documentation does not need to refer to specific pathnames ("TextEdit is in the Applications folder on your hard disk"). But when necessary if a user has to type a pathname in a dialog, for example—you can refer to it as "the path" or "the pathname."  
**plug in (v.):** Use only when referring to the specific act of plugging a connector into a port or outlet. For example, a power cord plugs into an electrical outlet; you can plug a USB connector into a USB port. See **connect.**  
**preferences:** Mac OS X has two types of preferences:  
- System Preferences: The general preferences application (it has an icon in the default Dock).
- application preferences: Use the application name, capped ("Mail Preferences").  
It's OK to call the things you set in preferences "settings" ("You can change settings with System Preferences").  
*Correct:* Click System Preferences (in the Dock) and click Sound.  
*Correct:* Use the Sound pane of System Preferences to choose an alert sound.  
*Correct:* Open System Preferences, click Network, and click the AppleTalk tab.  
*Correct:* In Mail Preferences, click Accounts.  
You can shorten the name of each of the system preferences "modules" to "<Name> preferences," as in "Startup Disk preferences."  
**Preview:** An application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**Print Center:** Two words, capped. Because it's an application, it's correct to say "Open Print Center" (not "the Print Center").  
**resize control:** The area in the lower-right corner of a window that you drag to resize the window.  
**screen shot:** Two words. Don't use "screen dump."  
**scroll bar:** The whole control is "the scroll bar"; the former "scroll box" is the "scroller." Note that "scroll bar" is two words.  
**scroll box:** Call what used to be called the "scroll box" the *scroller* (in Aqua it's no longer a box).  
**Setup Assistant:** The application you use to set up your computer. Don't call it "the Mac OS Setup Assistant."  
**sheet:** Refers to a modal dialog attached to a specific document window (when you choose Print, the Print sheet appears). In user documentation, call them "dialogs" ("sheet" is mainly for marketing and developer purposes).  
**Sherlock:** You don't have to say "Sherlock 2."  
**slider:** The widget you drag to set a value on a continuum (a range of values). The whole control is called "the slider control."  
**Startup Disk:** A pane in System Preferences (not "System Disk"). If you need to distinguish between the Mac OS 9 version and the Mac OS X version, you can refer to them as "the Startup Disk pane of Mac OS X System Preferences" and "the Classic Startup Disk control panel" or "the Startup Disk control panel included with Mac OS 9."  
**system:** Usually "computer" is preferable to "system," as in "The computer requires a folder named 'Applications' in this location."  
**System Preferences:** The user-modifiable set of preferences at the top is the "favorites toolbar." When you click a preferences button, the "[button name] pane" appears (for example, "the Network pane"). See also **preferences**.  
**tab:** In a dialog, the tab itself is called the "<tabname> tab," but the content you see when you click a tab is the "pane." Don't say "under the <tabname> tab." Examples:  
You can specify your home page in the Web pane of Internet preferences.  
To set up automatic login, click Login, then click the Login Window tab.  
You disconnect from the network time server in the Network Time pane of Date & Time preferences.  
**Terminal:** An application for using the command-line interface. Don't say "the Terminal"; "the Terminal application" is OK.  
**TextEdit:** One word with an internal cap. A word-processing application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**toolbar:** An area containing buttons, such as in Finder windows and the Mail application. Don't call them "shortcuts."  
**Tool Tips:** Don't use. Use **help tags**.  
**Type A connector:** A type of USB connector. Use once and describe what it looks like ("rectangular").  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**Type B connector:** A type of USB connector. Use once and describe what it looks like ("square").  
**UNIX:** Don't use when referring to the Mac OS X architecture. The correct term to use instead depends on the context. Darwin ("With the Terminal application, you can enter Darwin system commands") and "BSD utilities" are possible alternatives.  
**UNIX File System (UFS):** One of the file formats available in Disk Utility.  
**USB:** Abbreviation for "Universal Serial Bus." Provide spelled-out term only once; otherwise, use simply "USB."  
**USB adapter:** Use to refer to a device that lets you connect non-USB devices to USB ports.  
**user name:** Two words.  
**view control:** The three-button unit you use to change your view of Finder windows. The view control comprises the icon-view button, the list-view button, and the column-view button.  
**window controls:** Standard controls for windows include the close button, the minimize button, the zoom button, and the resize control.  
**workspace:** Don't use as a synonym for desktop or Finder.  
<span id="page-258-0"></span>**zoom button:** The rightmost (green) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar. Clicking this button toggles between the standard window size and the user-resized size.
