# Novice/Expert modes

The first time you use a program you have quite different needs from the tenth time you use it: In the beginning, you need as much information presented as possible so that you can use the program with a minimum of learning. Later on, with a program you use habitually, you want speed and simplicity. You want only information pertinent to the specific task you are carrying out, not a lot of instructions on how to delete an incorrect response.

Most large programs now have some sort of utility/configuration section. The configuration sections often enable the user to select date and time formats, color vs. B&W, and select whether or not to have sound. In that section, you can also enable the user to select a skill level. The rest of the program can then use the resulting flag, when set to expert, to simplify verbiage and perhaps enable more flexible branching within the

program — branching that would serve to get the novice into trouble but gives the expert the added flexibility she needs.

The skill level selection could be more sophisticated, perhaps with more than two levels, perhaps based on the type of user. For example, the same tax planner program might better bridge the gap between accountant and Apple owner if the accountant could select, "Expert at taxes, Novice at Apple" and the Apple owner could select "Novice at taxes, Expert at Apple". The possible combinations and permutations are truly boggling.
