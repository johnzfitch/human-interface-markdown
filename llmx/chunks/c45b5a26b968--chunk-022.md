Communicate with the user in concise and simple terms.  
The Apple Desktop Interface is approachable by the unsophisticated user. It requires no special "language." In fact, much of the user-computer interaction is graphical: the user points to objects on the screen and selects from available lists; the computer changes text and graphics at the user's request.  
Occasionally, the computer must display textual messages, either to describe a particular situation or to ask the user for a specific decision. In these instances, the phrasing must be very direct and unambiguous. It should inform users directly of the options available.  
Whenever words are involved, the design team should include a skilled writer.
