<!-- Chunk 9 | Source: 1986-07 Human Interface Guidelines (Second Beta Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 432 -->
Two kinds of consistency are important to the human interface. Programs should be both consistent within themselves and with one another. One of the primary purposes of the Apple human interface is to support consistency between applications.  
People usually divide their time among several applications; they get confused and irritated when they have to learn a completely new interface for each application. As a developer, you will not only save your customers from this confusion and irritation when you make your program consistent with others—you also save yourself time and resources by taking advantage of work already done.  
Consistency is easier to achieve on computers that supply, in toolboxes, many of the routines used to implement the human interface. Though you probably want to avoid writing routines that have already been made available, you should be aware that implementing the full human interface may require writing additional code that isn't supplied.  
In the quest for consistency, don't feel that you're limited to existing features. New ideas are essential to keep the interface growing. For example, a journaling or macro capability  
is an inevitable extension of the interface. But the bread-and-butter features, the kind that every application has, should certainly work the same way in all programs so that the user can easily move back and forth between applications. If your application has a feature that's described in these guidelines, you should implement the feature exactly as the guidelines describe it—but if you want to try something different, remember that a feature is probably less confusing to users if it's completely different than if it *half* complies with the guidelines.
