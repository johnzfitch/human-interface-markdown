iPhone OS provides a few buttons for use in table rows and other elements. These buttons, described in Table 10-4, should be used semantically correctly, as with all standard buttons and icons. In particular, avoid choosing a button based on its appearance, without regard for its documented meaning. See ["Using](#page-104-1) [System-Provided](#page-104-1) Buttons and Icons" (page 105) for a discussion of the reasons why it'simportant to use these buttons correctly.  
<span id="page-108-1"></span>Although the detail disclosure button is usually used in table rows, it can be used elsewhere. For more information about this button, see "Detail [Disclosure](#page-91-0) Buttons" (page 92). iPhone OS also provides a set of controls for use in table rows only; for more information about these, see ["Table-View](#page-83-0) Elements" (page 84).
