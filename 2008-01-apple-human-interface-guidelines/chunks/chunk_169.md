Icons that look good in rectangular-style toolbar controls are streamlined, black images that convey meaning through outline and contour, not internal detail. Because your icons should echo the appearance of the existing Mac OS X images inside rectangular-style toolbar controls, use the system-provided template images as a guide. As you design an icon for a rectangular-style toolbar control, keep the following points in mind:  
- Make the outline sharp and clear
- Use a straight-on perspective
- Use full black and a few shades of gray to suggest dimensionality  
- Use anti-aliasing
- Make sure the image is visually centered in the control (note that visually centered might not be the same as mathematically centered)  
Icons for regular-size rectangular-style toolbar controls should measure no more than 19 x 19 pixels.
