An Action menu should display only the Action icon and the standard downward-pointing arrow used in icon and bevel buttons with attached pop-up menus (for more information about these controls, see ["Icon](#page-278-0) Buttons and Bevel [Buttons](#page-278-0) with Pop-Up Menus" (page 279)). It's essential that you use the system-supplied Action icon so users understand what the control does (for more information on the Action icon and icons available for other types of controls, see ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) Images" (page 151)).  
The contents of an Action menu should conform to the guidelines for contextual menus, such as ensuring that each Action menu item is also available as a menu command and avoiding the display of keyboard shortcuts. For more information on the guidelinesthat govern contextual menus,see ["Contextual](#page-183-0) Menus" (page 184).  
An Action menu does not need a label, because users are familiar with the meaning of the Action icon. The only exception is the label you should supply for an Action menu button in a toolbar, because users can customize the toolbar to view toolbar items asicons with text or astext instead of icons(see ["Toolbars"](#page-195-0) (page 196) for more information on toolbars).
