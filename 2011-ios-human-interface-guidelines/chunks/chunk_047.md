Mail is one of the premier built-in apps on iPhone. People appreciate the clear, streamlined way it organizes large amounts of information in a series of easy-to-use screens.

Mail on iPad delivers the same core functionality. At the same time it provides more onscreen space for people's messages, meaningful touches of realism, and powerful organizing and editing toolsthat are always accessible but not obtrusive. The visual stability of a single, uncluttered screen provides what users need in one place, with minimal context changes.  
The differences between Mail on iPhone and Mail on iPad reflect the different user experiences of each device.  
- Mail on iPhone is designed to help mobile users handle their email while they're standing in line or walking to a meeting.
- Mail on iPad is efficient enough for people to use on the go, but its rich experience also encourages more in-depth use.  
Even though Mail on iPad tailors the user experience to the device, it does not alter the core functionality people are used to, or gratuitously change the location or effect of individual functions. iPhone Mail users easily recognize the toolbar items and mailbox structure in iPad Mail, and immediately know how to use them because they're virtually identical.  
To enhance the mobile email experience, Mail on iPad evolves the iPhone Mail UI in a number of important ways:  
**Expanded support for device orientations**. People can use Mail on iPad in any of the four orientations (landscape shown here). Although the landscape layout differs somewhat from the portrait layout, the focus remains on the content and functionality people care about.

**Increased focus on message content**. Mail on iPad reserves most of the screen for the current message in all orientations (portrait shown in the following figure). This includes moving the toolbar to the top of the message view to increase the vertical space available for the message content. With the extra space, people can read longer messages with less scrolling. And when people want to view the message list in portrait, they can still see a large portion of the current message.

**A flatter hierarchy**. Mail on iPad effectively flattens the Mail hierarchy (that is, account > mailbox > message list > message) by confining all levels above the message itself to a separate UI element. In landscape, this element isthe left pane of a split view; in portrait, this element is a **popover**, which pops up and coverssome of the main screen.  
**Drastically reduced full-screen transitions**. Because most of the hierarchy is available in a separate onscreen element, people can access most of what they need in a single screen. When people drill down through the hierarchy, it's the view inside the split view pane or popover that transitions, not the entire screen.  
**Realistic messages**. When people mark a message for deletion, itslides onto the message view like a physical sheet of paper. As they choose additional messages to delete, the messages form a realistic stack of papers, complete with slightly untidy edges.
