<span id="page-147-3"></span><span id="page-147-2"></span>Disclosure triangles are available to Carbon developers through the Control Manager (CreateDisclosureTriangleControl) or the Appearance Manager (DrawThemeButton). Cocoa provides this control only as part of the NSOutlineView class.  
<span id="page-148-0"></span>This chapter provides basic suggestions for arranging controls in dialogs and windows. These guidelines use many of the default control sizes defined in Interface Builder; any exceptions are noted. To simplify the process of resizing and repositioning existing dialogs and windows, most values are based on a multiple of 2 pixels. All user-visible text should use the standard fonts described in "Fonts" (page 197).  
The Control Manager (Carbon) and Application Kit (Cocoa) include smaller versions of the most commonly used controls, for use in utility windows when necessary. For utility window layout information, see ["Using Small Versions of](#page-159-2)  [Controls" \(page 160\)](#page-159-2).
