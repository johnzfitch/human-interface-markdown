**Label spacing and fonts**: Separator labelsshould be in a font that correspondsto the controlsin the window. Specifically, separator labels should use:  
- System font, when other controls are regular size.
- Small system font, when other controls are small.
- Mini system font, when other controls are mini.  
Separator labels should be 2 pixels from the beginning of the separator control.  
**Control spacing**: Separators should be at least 10 pixels away from other controls. Both ends of a separator should be an equal distance from the window edges. If you use more than one separator in a window, be sure every separator with the same orientation (vertical or horizontal) is the same length.
