The Window menu contains commands for managing multiple document windows. The menu lists an application's open document windows, including minimized windows, in the order in which they were opened. If a document contains unsaved changes, a bullet appears next to its name.

The Window menu should list only open documents; don't include open dialogs or utility windows.  
Even if your application consists of only one window, include a Window menu for the Minimize command.  
Window menu items appear in this order: Minimize, Zoom, <separator>, <application-specific window commands>, <separator>, Bring All to Front, <separator>, <list of open windows>. The Close command should appear in the File menu, below the Open command.
