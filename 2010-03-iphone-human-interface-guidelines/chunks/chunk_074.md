If sound enhances or is essential to the user experience or functionality of your application, you need to decide how your audio should fit in with the audio environment of the device and how it should respond to user actions. For example, you need to decide whether:  
- Your audio should continue playing when the device locks or is switched to silent
- Your audio should mix with other audio that is currently playing (such as a song in iPod)
- Your application needs to handle both audio input and output, either sequentially or simultaneously
- Your audio should automatically resume playing after an interruption
