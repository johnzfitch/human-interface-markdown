Webpagesthat are compatible with Safari on iPhone display and operate as designed (with the exception of any elements that rely on unsupported technologies, such as plug-ins, Flash, and Java). A compatible webpage does not tend to take extra steps to optimize the viewing experience on iPhone OS–based devices, but the device usually displays the page successfully.  
If you have an existing website or web application, first ensure that it works well on iPhone OS–based devices. Also, you should consider creating a custom icon users can put on their Home screens using the Web Clip feature. In effect, this allows users to keep on their Home Screens a bookmark to your website that looks like a native application icon. To learn more about creating a custom icon and how to make web content look great on iPhone OS–based devices, see *iPhone Human Interface Guidelines for Web Applications*.
