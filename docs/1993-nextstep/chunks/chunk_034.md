A NeXTSTEP keyboard resembles a conventional typewriter, with the usual keys in their traditional locations. However, the keyboard also has many keys that aren't found on typewriters, including the Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys and a set of keys arranged in a calculator-style numeric keypad. The behavior of each key is documented in the *User's Guide.* Behavior that plays an important role in the user interface is discussed below.  
#### **Modifier Keys**  
The keyboard's Shift, Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys are *modifier keys:* They change the effect of a keyboard or mouse action. For example, Shift-3 yields #, and Command-c issues a Copy command. Unlike character keys, modifier keys by themselves don't generate characters.  
To use a modifier key, the user must hold the key down and, while keeping it down, press the key (or perform the mouse action) to be modified. More than one modifier key may be used at a time-for example, Command-Shift-C.  
The modifier keys and their effects when used with other keys are presented below.  
- The Shift key modifies keystrokes to produce the uppercase character on letter keys and the upper character on two-character keys.
- The Alternate key modifies keystrokes to produce an alternate character to the one that appears on the key. In general, these are special characters that are used relatively infrequently. To find out which alternate characters are generated by which keys, see the *User's Guide.*
- The Control key modifies keystrokes to produce standard ASCII control characters. Some control characters are generated by single character keys-for example, Tab is Control-i, Return is Control-m, and backspace (Shift-Delete) is the same as Control-h.
- The Command key provides a way of choosing commands with the keyboard rather than the mouse. As an alternative to clicking a menu command with the mouse, the user can press the Command key in conjunction with the character displayed in the menu next to that command. For example, Command-c chooses the Copy command.
- The Help key doesn't modify keystrokes. It's used only to modify mouse actions, as described in "Using Modifier Keys with the Mouse" in this chapter.  
#### **Keyboard Alternatives**  
A graphical user interface is easy for most people to learn and remember. Objects have a familiar look on the screen and behave in a way that's reminiscent of the real-world objects they emulate. However, many users find it faster and easier to operate graphical objects using the keyboard rather than the mouse. For this reason, it's often appropriate to provide keyboard alternatives to the mouse, at least for common operations.  
#### **Programming Note: The Keyboard**  
For most applications, keyboard input is handled automatically. Text entry and display are handled by the Application Kit Text object, and keyboard alternatives are automatically converted into clicks on their associated control. All you have to do is choose the keyboard alternatives (as discussed later in this chapter) and specify them in Interface Builder"'.  
You'll need to handle keyboard input if your application doesn't use the Text object for its text entry.  
Keyboard alternatives consist of a single keystroke, modified by the Command key (and possibly another modifier key). The Command key is required so that keystrokes that make something happen (give commands) are clearly separated from those that enter data (cause typing to appear).  
Keyboard alternatives are most often used for menu commands, although they're permitted in a panel's buttons and pull-down lists, as well.  
Although keyboard alternatives are tied to a graphic representation, they don't require the representation to be on-screen. Keyboard alternatives for menu commands and panel buttons work even if the menu or panel is hidden.
