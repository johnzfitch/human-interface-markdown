At a minimum, a menu displays a list of menu items. Most menus also include a title that indicates the types of items that are in the list. In addition, menus can include some optional components, such as keyboard shortcut symbols, hierarchical menus (also known as submenus), toggled menu items, separators, icons, and symbols (such as the checkmark). For example, the TextEdit Edit menu includes a list of commands, a title ("Edit"), keyboard shortcuts, hierarchical menus, and separators that indicate different groups of items.

A menu bar menu might include examples of all of these components, but not all components are suitable for every type of menu. For example, a contextual menu doesn't need a title because it's automatically associated with the user's currentselection. To learn more about providing a contextual menu in your app,see [Contextual](#page-106-0) [Menus](#page-106-0) (page 107).
