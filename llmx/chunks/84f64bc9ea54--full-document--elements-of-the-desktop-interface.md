# Elements of the Desktop Interface

To implement the principles stated in Chapter 1, Apple has defined two classes of standard interface elements for the Apple Desktop Interface:

- screen elements that define the "look" of the Apple Desktop Interface
- conventions for human-computer interactions that account for the "feel" of the interface

The consistent "look and feel" of this interface makes users feel comfortable when they use a range of applications on Apple computers.

Both kinds of elements are introduced briefly in this chapter. Chapter 3 provides details of their content and form.
