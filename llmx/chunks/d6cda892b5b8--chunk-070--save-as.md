#### Save As  
Saves a copy of the active document under a new name provided by the user. When the user opens a document, makes changes to it, and then chooses Save As, the changes are not made to the original document. The changed version of the document is saved under the new name. The active document is no longer the one the user opened, but rather the new one with the new name.  
If no changes had been made to the original document when Save As was chosen, then there are two identical documents having different names.  
In applications that support stationery, the Save As dialog box includes a Stationery option. A document that is saved as stationery becomes a template containing whatever information was in the original document. Figure 3-32 shows a Save As dialog box with a Stationery option.

If stationery called "Memo" is opened, a document with the default name "Memo #1" is opened (then "Memo #2" and so on). When this document is saved, the Save As dialog box appears again, so that the user can rename the document if desired.
