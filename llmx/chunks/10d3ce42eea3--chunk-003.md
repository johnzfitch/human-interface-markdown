<!-- Chunk 3 | Source: 1987 Apple Human Interface Guidelines - The Apple Desktop Interface.pdf | Est. Tokens: 627 -->
Not very long ago, most users of personal computers were also programmers. In fact, many of them were computer builders as well, because personal computers were available only as kits. Today, most personal computers are seen as tools that magnify a person's ability to perform all kinds of tasks that were formerly done without computers. The Apple Desktop Interface provides a consistent and familiar computer environment in which people can perform their many tasks. People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done.  
Given this focus on people and their tasks, the Apple Desktop Interface has had to assume a model of people, in order to suit the interface to them. People, however, are delightfully complex and varied, which assures that <sup>a</sup> theory of human activity that would provide a complete framework for the design of human-computer interaction is <sup>a</sup> long way off. Such a theory would be oversimplified anyway, because computers themselves change the way we think, feel, and behave. Computer design and human activity must therefore evolve together. Apple believes that caring how people behave will help computer designers provide a consistent world that a person can enter with ease and effectiveness, even though many of the details of human activity are not understood.  
The Apple Desktop Interface is based on the assumption that people are instinctively curious: they want to learn, and they learn best by active self-directed exploration of their environment. People strive to master their environment: they like to have a sense of control over what they are doing, to see and understand the results of their own actions. People are also skilled at manipulating symbolic representations: they love to communicate in verbal, visual, and gestural languages. Finally, people are both imaginative and artistic when they are provided with <sup>a</sup> comfortable context; they are most productive and effective when the environment in which they work and play is enjoyable and challenging.  
The next section of this chapter sets forth ten human interface principles that explicitly emphasize the views expressed above. A subsequent section describes <sup>a</sup> programming strategy that takes these principles into account. Chapter 2 describes a specific set of elements for a Desktop Interface that can be used consistently across a range of very different applications. Chapter 3 provides standards and specifications for their implementation.
