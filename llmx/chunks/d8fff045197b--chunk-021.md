<!-- Chunk 21 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 265 -->
When all applications have the same basic user interface, every application benefits. Consistency makes each application easier to learn, thus increasing the likelihood of its acceptance and use.  
Just as drivers become accustomed to a set of conventions on public highways, so users tend to learn and rely on a set of conventions for their interaction with a computer. Although different applications are designed to accomplish different tasks, they all share, to one degree or another, a set of common operations-selecting, editing, scrolling, setting options, making choices from a menu, managing windows, and so on. Reliable conventions are possible only when these operations are the same for all applications.  
The conventions permit users (like drivers) to develop a. set of habits, and to act almost instinctively in familiar situations. Instead of being faced with special rules for each application (which would be like each town defining its own rules of the road), users can carry knowledge of how one application works on to the next application.
