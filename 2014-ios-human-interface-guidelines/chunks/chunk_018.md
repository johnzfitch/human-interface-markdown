iOS 7 often displays content in distinct layersthat convey hierarchy and position, and that help users understand the relationships among onscreen objects.

By using a translucent background and appearing to float above the Home screen, folders separate their content from the rest of the screen.  
Reminders displays lists in layers, as shown here. When users work with one list, the other lists are collected together at the bottom of the screen.

Calendar uses enhanced transitions to give users a sense of hierarchy and depth as they move between viewing years, months, and days. In the scrolling year view shown here, users can instantly see today's date and perform other calendar tasks.  
When usersselect a month, the year view zoomsin and reveals the month view. Today's date remains highlighted and the year appears in the back button, so users know exactly where they are, where they came from, and how to get back.

A similar transition happens when users select a day: The month view appears to split apart, pushing the current week to the top of the screen and revealing the hourly view of the selected day. With each transition, Calendar reinforces the hierarchical relationship between years, months, and days.
