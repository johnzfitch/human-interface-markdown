You can specify the text, the number of buttons, and the button contents in an alert, but you can't customize the background appearance of the alert itself.  
Although you can choose the number of buttons to place in an alert, a two-button alert is often the most useful, because it is easiest for users to choose between two alternatives. It is rarely a good idea to display an alert with a single button because such an alert cannot give users any control over the situation; instead, it can only display information and provide a dismiss button. An alert that contains three or more buttons is significantly more complex than a two-button alert, and should be avoided if possible. In fact, if you find that you need to offer users more than two choices, you should consider using an action sheet instead (see ["Using](#page-70-0) Action [Sheets"](#page-70-0) (page 71) and ["Creating](#page-72-0) an Action Sheet" (page 73) for more information on this type of view).  
Because userssometimesrespond to alerts without reading them carefully, be sure to provide an appropriate default choice. To help guide inattentive userstowardsthis choice, make the light-colored, right-hand button the safe, default alternative. For example, you might choose to make this button the Cancel button, to help users avoid inadvertently causing a dangerous action, or you might make it represent the most common response, if the resulting action isn't destructive.  
The following guidelines describe how buttons are configured in an alert:  
- In an alert with two buttons, the button on the left is always dark-colored and the button on the right is never dark-colored.
- ❏ In a two-button alert that proposes a potentially risky action, the button that cancels the action should be on the right and light-colored.
- ❏ In a two-button alert that proposes a benign action, the button that cancels the action should be on the left (and therefore dark-colored).
- In an alert with a single button, the button is light-colored.  
**Note:** A Cancel button may be either light-colored or dark-colored and it may be on the right or the left, depending on whether the alternate choice is destructive.  
The main function of an alert is to tell users about something that happened, perhaps unexpectedly. To do this, you need to display enough text to clearly explain the situation and what, if anything, the user can do about it. Often, a title that succinctly describes the situation or event is sufficient for an alert.  
Although brevity is recommended for alert titles, you should not create an alert title that consists of a single word because that does not convey enough information. "Error," for example, is a particularly ineffective alert title because it doesn't help the user understand why the alert appeared, and it gives the impression that the application is unable to provide more useful information. In fact, you should try to avoid using the word "error" anywhere in your alert text and instead focus on describing the actual situation.  
Sometimes, it's a good idea to add to the alert a sentence, or message, that provides context or additional information. For example, if an event or situation can be caused by different things, you might choose to provide an alert that always uses the same title to describe the event, but displays different explanatory messages, depending on the cause. At other times, a title might not add any useful information. When this is the case, you can dispense with the title and instead display a brief message that describes the situation.  
As mentioned above, an alert often displays two buttons; Figure 7-2 shows such an alert. Note that the alert shown in Figure 7-2 follows the guidelines that govern the placement and color of the buttons. Specifically, because the alert proposes a benign action, the button that cancels the action (that is, Don't Allow) is on the left, and therefore dark-colored.
