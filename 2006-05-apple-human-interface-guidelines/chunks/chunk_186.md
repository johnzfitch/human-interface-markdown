<span id="page-133-1"></span>Some applications that represent objects, such as QuickTime Player and Calculator, are most easily recognized bythe objects themselves. When creatingicons for such applications, it's more aesthetically pleasingto create a simplified, idealized representation of the object, instead of usingan actual screen shot of the software. Re-creating the object is particularly important when users could confuse the icon with the actual interface.

<span id="page-133-2"></span>These icons, many of which are a precursor of what you'll see when you open the application, use a straight-on perspective (rather than the "on a desktop" user application style). You never see the Calculator onscreen in three dimensions, for example, so its icon doesn't depict it that way.
