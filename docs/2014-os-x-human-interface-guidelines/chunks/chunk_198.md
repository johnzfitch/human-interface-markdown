OS X provides an image you can display when a user drags multiple documents or items. However, it's best if you can provide more meaningful drag images (to learn more about this, see Drag and [Drop](#page-288-0) (page 289)).

As with all system-provided images, use the multiple-documents image in accordance with its intended meaning. (The constant name of the drag image is NSImageNameMultipleDocuments.)
