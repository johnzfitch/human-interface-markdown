Most users don't distinguish between closing an app's main window and quitting the app. Unless there are good reasons for drawing attention to the difference, it's best to respond to both events in the same way. Follow these guidelines to give users a good experience as they leave and return to your app.  
**Decide whether users need to explicitly quit your app.** If your app displays only a single window, it's often appropriate to quit automatically when users close the window.  
**Reopen in the same state in which users left your app.** Preserving user-modifiable settings, such as window dimension and location, enhances users's perception of the stability of your app. OS X makesstate-preservation easy to achieve when you enable Resume. To learn how to support Resume in your code, see User Interface Preservation in *Mac App Programming Guide* .  
**Support Auto Save and Versions, if appropriate.** Users expect their content to be saved continuously and mostly without their intervention. If users can create documents in your app, be sure to opt in to Auto Save so that they can rely on these behaviors in your app. (To learn more about how these technologies should work in your app, see Auto Save and [Versions](#page-251-0) (page 252).)
