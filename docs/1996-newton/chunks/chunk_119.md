Your icons should be designed with multicultural use in mind. For example, to localize an icon for outgoing communications, you might consider using the design of a mailbox. But if you did, you would have to design a different icon for every country in which your product shipped. Instead, try to design one icon that is understood universally, or at least in many countries. An example of an icon that is understood around the world is the Out Box icon. Even though people in different locations around the world deposit mail in differently shaped boxes, they all still recognize the Out Box icon as a representation of outgoing communications.  
In general, icons shouldn't be gratuitously cute. Humor typically doesn't translate well to other cultures or languages. Also, don't use inside jokes or pictures that represent code names. Although it might work to use such icons during your development process for product identification, be sure to remove them and replace them with appropriate icons before you ship your product. Symbols and colloquial language are usually culturally dependent, meaning that what one person relates to may have no meaning or may be an insult in another person's culture.
