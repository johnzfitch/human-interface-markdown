Whereas buttons perform instantaneous or continuous actions, check boxes and radio buttons let the user choose among alternative values for a parameter.  
Check boxes act like toggle switches; they're used to indicate the state of a parameter that must be either off or on. The parameter is on if the box is checked, otherwise it's off. The check boxes appearing together in a given context are independent of each other; any number of them can be off or on.  
Radio buttons typically occur in groups; they're round and are filled in with a black circle when on. (In a MouseText-based program, they

are rectangular and are filled in with a white rectangle when on.)
They're called radio buttons because they act like the buttons on a car
radio. At any given time, exactly one button in the group is on.
Clicking one button in a group turns off the current button.  
Both check boxes and radio buttons are accompanied by text that identifies what each button does.
