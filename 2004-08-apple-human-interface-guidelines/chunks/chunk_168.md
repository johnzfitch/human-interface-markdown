An application that saves the contents of individual windows—which would be most text and graphics applications—should use document-specific sheets for its Save dialogs. The Save dialog has two states: minimal and expanded. Clicking the disclosure button toggles between these states. If the user changes the state, the next Save dialog should open in the selected state.  
<span id="page-143-2"></span>As described in *Apple Software Design Guidelines*, your application should pass in a filename extension as part of every filename. Users can control its visibility using the Hide Extension checkbox in the expanded Save dialog; see ["The Expanded Save Dialog"](#page-144-1) (page 145). Existing documents do not get extensions added to or removed from their filenames unless the user chooses Save As and changes the setting in the Save dialog.
