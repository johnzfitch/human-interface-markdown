All menusimplement the explicit action paradigm: People identify what needsto be acted on and then specify the action by choosing a menu item. (To learn more about this paradigm,see Explicit and [Implied](#page-61-1) Actions (page 62).)  
To choose an item in a menu, the user opens the menu and moves the pointer to the desired item. As the pointer passes over each active menu item, it highlights and opensitssubmenu (if it has one). No action occurs until the user chooses an item. This behavior lets people open and scan menus to find out what features are available without having to actually perform an action. When the user chooses a menu item, it blinks briefly to confirm the user's choice and then performs the action.  
After the user opens a menu, it remains open until another action causes it to close. Such actions include:  
- Choosing an item in the menu
- Moving the pointer to another menu title in the menu bar
- Clicking outside of the menu
- A system-initiated alert
- A system-initiated app switch or quit
