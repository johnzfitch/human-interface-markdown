# Types of objects

Strictly speaking, everything on a Macintosh screen is displayed graphically. Still, it's useful to distinguish among three types of objects—text, graphics, and lists or arrays—because the user deals with each of them in a different way. Figure 52 shows an example of each.

The rest to some faint meaning make pretence But Shadwell never deviates into sense. Some beams of wit on other souls may fall, Strike through and make a lucid interval; But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray, His rising fogs prevail upon the day.
