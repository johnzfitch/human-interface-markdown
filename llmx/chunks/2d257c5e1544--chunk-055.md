The menu structure consists of the menu bar (which displays the menu titles), the menus, and each menu's menu items.  
Once a user has selected the object, text, or whatever, that he wants to do something to, he chooses an operation from a menu. The menu bar extends across the top of the screen and displays the title of each available menu. A menu itself is not visible until the user selects it be pressing its title. Figure 18 shows an example of a menu bar that extends across the top of the Macintosh screen.  
**Figure 18.** Menu Bar [Fig. 1 in Inside Mac's Menu Manager Chapter]  
If the user moves the pointer to the Edit portion of the menu bar and presses the mouse button, the Edit menu appears, as shown in Figure 19.

Menu items should be either verbs or adjectives. Use verbs (or verb phrases) to show the user what can be *done-Copy,* Find, and Show Page, for example. Use adjectives (or adjective phrases) to let the user specify an attribute of a selected object-Chicago [font], Underline, and Double Space, for example. Menu items usually apply to the current selection, although some apply to the whole document or window.  
When you're designing an application program, don't assume that *everything* has to be done through menus. Menus are often the best method, but sometimes it's more appropriate for an operation to take place as a result of direct user manipulation of a graphic object on the screen, such as a control or icon. Alternatively, a single menu item can execute complicated instructions if it brings up a dialog box for the user to fJlI in.
