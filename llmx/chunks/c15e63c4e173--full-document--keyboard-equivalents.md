# Keyboard Equivalents

- Are Apple-reserved keyboard equivalents used properly? Even if your application doesn't support one of these menu commands, it shouldn't use these keyboard equivalents for another function.
- Do you avoid using Command–Space bar and Command–*modifier key*–Space bar in your application, since they are reserved for use by the Script Manager?
- Do keyboard equivalents appear where appropriate? Are the keyboard equivalents case-independent? (This second rule does not apply if the product uses both cases in the keyboard equivalents and enables the user to predict which case to use.)
