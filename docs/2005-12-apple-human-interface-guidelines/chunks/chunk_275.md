<span id="page-212-3"></span>An application that saves the contents of individual windows—which would be most text and graphics applications—should use document-specific sheets for its Save dialogs. The Save dialog has two states: minimal and expanded. Clicking the disclosure button toggles between these states. If the user changes the state, the next Save dialog should open in the selected state.  
Your application should pass in a filename extension as part of every filename. Users can control its visibility using the Hide Extension checkbox in the expanded Save dialog; see[Figure 13-15](#page-184-2) (page 185). Existing documents do not get extensions added to or removed from their filenames unless the user chooses Save As and changes the setting in the Save dialog.
