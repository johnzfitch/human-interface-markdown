Here are some guidelines to help you create effective tag messages.  
Help Tags **223**  
- Use the fewest words possible. Try to keep your tags to a maximum of 60 to 75 characters. Since help tags are always on, it is important to keep your tag text unobtrusive—that is, *short*—and useful. Present one concept per tag and make sure the concept is directly related to the item. Localization lengthens the text by 20 to 30 percent, which is another good reason to keep the tag short.
- Describe what the user will accomplish. The tag should say what the user wants to know most—what task the user can accomplish by using the item. If absolutely necessary, you can give more information after describing what will be accomplished.
- Create tags that are applicable to all situations. Help tags are not contextually sensitive; the same text appears when an item is selected, dimmed, and so on. By describing what the item accomplishes, you may help the user understand the current state of the control.
- Use help tags to provide functional information for controls that are unique to your application. Don't tag window controls, scroll bars, and other parts of the standard Mac OS X interface.
- Don't put the item's name in the tag unless the name helps the user and isn't available onscreen. If an item is referred to by name in the documentation and in the tag, make sure the names match.
- You can use a sentence fragment beginning with a verb, for example, "Restores default settings." You can also omit articles to limit the size of the tag. If the tag text is a complete sentence, end it with a period.
- Describe only the item the user points to.
- Use hints sparingly.
- If you implement an expanded tag to add another layer of information, don't repeat the text in the original tag. An expanded tag should do one of the following:
- More fully explain or describe the results of the action described in the small help tag.  
*Help tag:* Shuffle the play order.  
*Expanded tag:* Plays the current list of songs in random order.  
■ Explain when or why the user would do the action described in the small tag.  
<span id="page-223-0"></span>*Help tag:* Create folder on player.  
*Expanded tag:* Use folders to organize music on the player.
