## SIGGRAPH

SIGGRAPH (Special Interest Group on Graphics) is a special interest group of the ACM concerned with computer graphics and animation. SIGGRAPH addresses all types of professionals involved in the computer graphics community. SIGGRAPH publishes a research journal and sponsors an annual conference.

There are a number of local SIGGRAPH groups that discuss graphics issues and participate in related projects. Contact SIGGRAPH through the ACM for more information about local groups and events.

*Computer Graphics* is the official journal of SIGGRAPH. Published three times a year, *Computer Graphics* presents book reviews, conference information, research papers, articles on graphics-related topics, and a calendar of upcoming events.

SIGGRAPH is an annual conference that provides a forum for the presentation and publication of scholarly papers on computer graphics. The conference includes technical programs and courses, discussion panels, exhibits, and technical papers; and provides a marketplace for computer graphics hardware, software, and systems. It is usually held in the summer.
