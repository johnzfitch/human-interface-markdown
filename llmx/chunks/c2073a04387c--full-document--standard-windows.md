## **Standard Windows**

The parts of a standard window are labeled in the figure below. Not all standard windows need every part-for example, the first window displayed by the Workspace Manager'" has no close button, so that beginning users won't accidentally close the one window they need to use the Workspace Manager.

More information on standard windows, as well as windows in general, is in Chapter 4, "The Window Interface to Applications."
