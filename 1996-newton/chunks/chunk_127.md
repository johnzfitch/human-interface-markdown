You can use an icon to label a button. For example, the Action button and the Filing button have icons as labels. The button may have a border or not, depending on the icon design and the button location (see ["Picture Buttons"](#page-100-0)  [on page 3-7\)](#page-100-0). Figure 5-10 shows a few buttons with icons as labels.

If a button has a border, leave white space between the icon and the interior edge of the button border. On an Apple MessagePad, leave at least one pixel of white space between the icon and the border.
