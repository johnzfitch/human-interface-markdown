An **activity indicator** shows the progress of a task or process that is of unknown duration. If you need to display progress for a task of known duration, use a progress view instead (see ["Progress](#page-114-0) Views" (page 115) for more information about this control). The "spinning gear" appearance of the activity indicator shows users that processing is occurring, but does not suggest when it will finish.  
Figure 9-1 showstwo types of activity indicators. The activity indicator in the status bar isthe network activity indicator; it should be displayed when your application accesses the network for more than a couple of seconds. The larger activity indicator in the toolbar should be displayed if it will take more than a second or two for your application to perform the current task.

An activity indicator is a good feedback mechanism to use when it's more important to reassure users that their task or process has not stalled than it is to suggest when processing will finish.  
You can choose the size and color of an activity indicator to coordinate with the background of the view in which it appears. By default, an activity indicator is white.  
An activity indicator disappears when the task or process has completed. This default behavior is recommended, because users expect to see an activity indicator when something is happening and they associate a stationary activity indicator with a stalled process.
