There are several menu items, particularly in the File and Edit menus, that commonly have keyboard equivalents. Keyboard equivalents are provided for people who prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard instead of using <sup>a</sup> pointing device to choose operations from menus.  
The letter used for <sup>a</sup> keyboard equivalent should be mnemonic—it should either be the first letter of the command (or of an important word in the command), or it should have some other relevance (X for Cut, for example) so that the user can remember it. Keyboard equivalents are case independent. In other words, both Apple-S and Apple<sup>s</sup> mean Save. The keyboard equivalents are shown in the menus as capital letters for consistency and aesthetics. The keyboard equivalent for Help in the Apple menu isshown as Apple-?, but itdoesn't actually require that the Shift key be pressed. Modifier-key combinations other than the ones listed here should also be case independent.  
For the sake of consistency, several of the available keyboard equivalents should be used only for the operations listed below and should never be used for any other purpose.
