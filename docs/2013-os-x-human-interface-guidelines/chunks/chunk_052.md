As early as possible in the design process, start thinking about accessibility and worldwide compatibility so that the market for your app is as large as possible. It's much easier to build in support for accessibility and internationalization from the beginning than it is to add support to a finished app.  
Making an app usable by people with disabilities—that is, making it accessible—benefits you, too, because in many places accessible apps are the only apps that governments and some institutions can purchase.  
OS X includes many assistive features, including VoiceOver, zoom, and full keyboard access mode. When your app is accessible, users can interact with it using the assistive device or feature of their choice. For example, in addition to speaking the UI to VoiceOver users, VoiceOver can also show the current focus and output to the user's sighted colleagues.

To learn about some of the user experience issues you should keep in mind, see ["Accessibility"](#page-83-0) (page 84). To learn what programming steps you need to take to make your app accessible, start by reading *Accessibility Overview for OS X* .  
It's a good idea to prepare your app for localization by internationalizing it. Internationalization involves separating any user-visible text and imagesfrom your executable code. When you isolate this data into resource files, you make it easier to localize your app, which is the process of adapting an internationalized app for culturally distinct markets.  
For details on how to internationalize your app and prepare for localization, see ["Internationalization"](#page-83-1) (page 84).
