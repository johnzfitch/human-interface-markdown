Drag-and-drop functionality is ubiquitous in Mac OS X, making it one of the most appreciated and well-known features of the platform. Although you should be sure to provide keyboard alternatives to the drag-and-drop operations in your application, it's essential to fully support this direct manipulation technology. For more information on this technology, see ["Drag and](#page-110-0) [Drop"](#page-110-0) (page 111).  
#### ■ Use display names.  
Mac OS X allows users to customize how file, directory, and application names are displayed. Macintosh users are accustomed to making this choice and expect their preference to be observed throughout the file system and in applications. Be sure to respect the user's display name preference in your application (note that this also makes internationalization much easier). For more information about filename extensions and display names, see ["File Formats and Filename](#page-56-1) [Extensions"](#page-56-1) (page 57).
