<span id="page-56-5"></span><span id="page-56-2"></span>**Icon genres** help communicate what you can do with an application before you open it. Applications are classified by role—user applications, software utilities, and so on—and each category, or genre, has its own icon style. This differentiation is very important for helping users easily distinguish between types of icons in the Dock.

For example, the icons for user applications are colorful and inviting, while utilities have a more serious appearance. Figure 5-2 shows user application icons in the top row and utility icons in the bottom row. These genres are further described in ["User Application Icons"](#page-58-3) (page 59) and ["Utility](#page-59-2) [Icons"](#page-59-2) (page 60).

In iTunes, for example, a visual cue provided in the application icon is carried over into icons for other files associated with iTunes, forming an icon family, as shown in Figure 5-3.
