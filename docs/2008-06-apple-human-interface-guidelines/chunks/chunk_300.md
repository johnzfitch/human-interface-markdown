In a toolbar, use rectangular-style toolbar controls to give users access to frequently used commands and objects (for guidelines on designing the contents of a toolbar, see ["Designing](#page-198-1) a Toolbar" (page 199)). For example, the Finder uses a combination of rectangular-style toolbar buttons and segmented controls to allow users to preview an item with Quick Look, choose a view style, see the path of an item's location, navigate through previously viewed items, and perform an action on an item. Figure 15-2 showsthe rectangular toolbar buttons and segmented controls the Finder uses.

In a bottom bar, use rectangular-style toolbar controls when you need to provide controls that directly affect the contents or organization of the window body. In general, controls in the bottom bar are important, but they are less frequently used than controls in the toolbar (see ["Bottom](#page-206-0) Bars" (page 207) for guidelines on designing the contents of a bottom bar). For example, the rectangular-style toolbar controlsin the iCal bottom bar include a segmented control that allows users to add calendars and change the items displayed in the source list, and a button that shows or hides the to-do list, as shown in Figure 15-3.
