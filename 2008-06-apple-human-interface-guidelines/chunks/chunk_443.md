Use a column view when there is only one way the data can be sorted or when you want to present only one way ofsorting the data. A column view is also useful for displaying a deep hierarchy,such as a file system, where users frequently move back and forth among multiple levels.  
When you use a column view to display a hierarchy, be sure to display the first level of the hierarchy (the root level) in the leftmost column. As users select items, the focus moves to the right, displaying either the child objects at that node or, if there are no more children, the terminal object (a leaf node in the hierarchy). When the user selects a terminal object, you can display additional information about it in the rightmost column.
