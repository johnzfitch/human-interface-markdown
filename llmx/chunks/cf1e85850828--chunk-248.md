CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work Conference) is a biannual conference on cooperative work in the computer environment, sponsored jointly by SIGCHI and SIGOIS (Special Interest Group Office Information Systems). The conference looks at all aspects of CSCW, including meeting-coordination software, mail systems, and other collaborative efforts.
