The Escape (Esc) key basically means "let me out of here." It has specific meanings in certain contexts:  
- The user can press Escape instead of clicking Cancel in a dialog.
- The user can press Escape to stop an operation in progress (such as printing), instead of pressing Command-period.  
<span id="page-160-2"></span>Pressing Escape should never cause the user to back out of an operation that would require extensive time or work to reenter. When the user presses Escape during a lengthy operation, display a confirmation dialog to be sure that the key wasn't pressed accidentally.
