#### Selections in Graphics  
There are several different ways to select graphic objects and to show selection feedback in existing applications. This section uses the MacDraw paradigm, but other situations may require other solutions.  
A MacDraw document is a collection of individual graphic objects. To select one of these objects, the user clicks once on the object, which is then bracketed with four "handles." (The handles are used to stretch or shrink the object, and aren't discussed here.) Figure 11 shows some examples of selection in MacDraw.

Figure 11. Graphics Selections in MacDraw  
There are two ways to select more than one object. A range selection includes every object completely contained within the dotted rectangle that encloses the range as the user drags the mouse. A discontinuous selection includes only those objects explicitly selected.
