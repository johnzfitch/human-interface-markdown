People interact with the interface by pointing at onscreen objects with a device, typically a mouse. The Macintosh operating system works according to two fundamental paradigms, both of which assume that users can see what they're doing onscreen at all times and can point at what they see. The paradigms are based on a general form of user action: noun-then-verb.  
In one paradigm, the user selects an object (the noun) and then chooses the action to be performed on the object (the verb). All actions available for a selected object are listed in the menus, so a user who is unsure of what to do next can scan through them. Users can choose an available action without having to remember a specific command.  
In the second paradigm, the user drags an object (the noun) onto another object that has an action (the verb) associated with it (dragging a document icon to a folder, for example). The user doesn't choose a menu command, but it's clear what happens to an object when it's placed on another one. For this paradigm to work, the user must recognize what objects are for; the fact that the Trash looks like its real-world counterpart makes the interface easier to use.
