The **separator line** is used in dialog boxes to separate groups of controls by delineating horizontal or vertical regions of the content area. It provides an Appearance-compliant alternative to drawing a QuickDraw line.  
The separator line is two pixels wide. Under platinum appearance, the top pixel of a horizontal separator line creates the line itself and the bottom pixel gives it the engraved effect.
