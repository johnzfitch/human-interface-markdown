When people directly manipulate onscreen objects instead of using separate controls to manipulate them, they're more engaged with their task and it's easier for them to understand the results of their actions.

Using the Multi-Touch interface, people can pinch to directly expand or contract an image or content area. And in a game, players move and interact directly with onscreen objects—for example, a game might display a combination lock that users can spin to open.  
In an iOS app, people experience direct manipulation when they:  
- Rotate or otherwise move the device to affect onscreen objects
- Use gestures to manipulate onscreen objects
- Can see that their actions have immediate, visible results
