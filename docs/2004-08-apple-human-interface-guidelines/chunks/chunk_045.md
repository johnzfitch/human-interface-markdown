There are several conventions for selecting graphic objects. This section describes two ways to show selection feedback; other situations may require other solutions.  
An object-based graphics document is a collection of individual graphic objects. To select an object, the user clicks it once. The object is then bracketed with handles, which the user can use to move or resize the object.  
In object-based graphics documents, users can select with the mouse alone or a combination of the mouse and the keyboard. A user can drag a dotted rectangle and select every object that is included, even partially, within the rectangle's outline. The user can also select an initial object and then use Shift-click or Command-click to select other objects. If the objects have a defined order, Shift-click  
should result in a continuous selection and Command-click should provide a discontinuous selection. If the order is not defined, then both actions result in a discontinuous selection. Examples of continuous and discontinuous selections are shown in ["Selection Methods"](#page-32-1) (page 33).
