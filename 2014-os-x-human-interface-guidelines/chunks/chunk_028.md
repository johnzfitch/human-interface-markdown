Use the colon character (:) in text that introduces and provides context for controls. The text can describe what the controls do or a task the user can perform with them. The combination of introductory text, colon, and controls forms a visually distinct grouping that helps users find the controls that apply to a particular task and understand what the controls do.  
A colon implies a direct connection between the descriptive text and a particular control or set of controls, so it doesn't belong in the text that appears in:  
- A control label, such as a push button name or a command pop-down menu title
- Menu items (unless the colon is part of a user-created menu item) and menu titles
- Tab and segmented controls
- Table view column headings  
**Note:** The colon is not used as a pathname separator in OS X. If it's necessary to display a raw pathname (which should almost never be the case), use the forward slash character (/). Always be sure to avoid displaying a pathname in a window title.  
The colon is a good way to associate introductory text with related controls, but it's not the only way to do so. For example, you might use a tab view to display different groups of related controls. For guidelines on how to use this view, see Tab [View](#page-226-0) (page 227).  
**Don't use a colon in the text that serves as a group box title.** (A **group box** is a control that lets you create a visually distinct area of content, such as the set of screen corner controls shown here.) In these cases, the group box itself takes the place of the colon and makes explicit the relationship of the introductory text to the controls that follow it. To learn more about the group box control, see [Group](#page-228-0) Box (page 229).

**Use a colon in introductory text that precedes a control or set of related controls that aren't in a group box.** The text can be a noun or phrase that describes either the target of the control or the task the user can perform. The following examples illustrate some variations on this arrangement of text and controls:  
● Use a colon in text that precedes a control on the same line.  
![](images/_page_51_Picture_7.jpeg)  
● Use a colon in text that precedes the first control in a vertical list of controls.

Use a colon in text that precedes the first control in a horizontal list of controls.

● Use a colon in introductory text that appears above a control.

● Use a colon in checkbox or radio button text that introduces a second control. (Note that if the text describing a checkbox or radio button state doesn't introduce a second control, it should not include a colon.)  
![](images/_page_52_Figure_4.jpeg)  
**Note:** If you use the type of layout shown above, be sure to disable the second control when the preceding checkbox or radio button is unselected.  
**A colon is optional before a control that is part of a sentence or phrase.** This guideline is flexible because it depends on how much of the text follows the control and how the sentence or phrase can be interpreted. Consider the specific combination of text and controls and the overall layout of your window as you decide whether to use the colon in the following situations.  
If none of the text follows the control, then the control's value supplies the end of the sentence or phrase. A colon is recommended in this case, because this is another variation of the guideline to include a colon in text that precedes a control. For example, the term "Genie effect" completes the sentence that begins "Minimize windows using:"

If a substantial portion of the sentence or phrase follows the control, a colon is optional.

Similarly, the colon is optional when some text followsthe control, but that text does not represent a substantial portion of the sentence or phrase. To help you decide whether a colon is appropriate in these cases, determine if the presence of a colon breaks the sentence or phrase (including the value of the control) in an awkward or unnatural way.
