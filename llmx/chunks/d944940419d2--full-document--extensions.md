## **Extensions**

Users will come to count on a basic set of familiar operations throughout the user interface. It's each application's responsibility to make the action paradigms it uses apparent to the user-controls should look like controls (like objects that fit into the targeted-action paradigm), palettes of tools should be self-evident, and so on.

An application should also make certain that its paradigms fit the action. It wouldn't be appropriate, for example, to force users to choose a "moving tool" or a control just to move an object. Graphical objects should move, as real objects do, through direct manipulation.

Properly used, the paradigms described above can accommodate a wide variety of applications. Yet over time, as programmers develop innovative software, new and unanticipated operations might require extending the user interface.

An extension should be a last resort. All possible solutions within the standard user interface described in this chapter should be exhausted first. Added functionality must be carefully weighed against the ill effects of eroding interapplication consistency for the user. Any extension should be clearly different to the user from existing paradigms.

If an extension is required, it should be designed to grow naturally out of the standard user interface; and must adhere to the general principles discussed above.
