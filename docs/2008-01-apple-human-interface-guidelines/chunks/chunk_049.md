Be very cautious about creating new interface elements because you may introduce unnecessary complexity. You will have to work extremely hard to make sure that any newly introduced elements fit in with those provided by Cocoa and Carbon. Additionally, as the Aqua user interface continues to evolve, your custom elements will require updating to adapt to changes in Aqua.  
Before implementing a new interface element, *make sure* that you can't use existing elements or a combination of them to achieve the desired result. Usabilitytestingis essential for determiningwhether a new element works.  
<span id="page-54-0"></span>*Apple HumanInterface Guidelines* contains myriad design principles and guidelines that,when followed, lead to fully Aqua-compliant applications that support the appropriate Mac OS X technologies and stand out in their target markets. As you design an application, however, you may find that business concerns, such as resource constraints and schedule commitments, impactyour abilityto followthese guidelines to the fullest. When this is the case, how do you decide which Mac OS X technologies to use and support? Howdoyou prioritizeyourworksoyour application is the best that it can be,given the realities of your development environment?  
<span id="page-54-1"></span>To help you answer these questions, this chapter organizes human interface features, principles, and guidelines into three layers. [Figure](#page-54-1) 4-1 (page 55) displays these layers in the outline of a pyramid to emphasize the progressive improvement and refinement of an application as it implements the guidelines in each successive layer.

Each layer in [Figure](#page-54-1) 4-1 (page 55) correlates closely with a level of a user's satisfaction with an application. For example, an application that merely meets the minimum requirements may be acceptable, but probably does not deliver the features most users expect and is unlikely to inspire admiration and loyalty in its users. Because user satisfaction ultimately determines the success or failure of your application, it should be at the heart of your design decisions. If business realities require you to make design tradeoffs, use the guidelines described in this chapter to help you decide which features to concentrate on first.
