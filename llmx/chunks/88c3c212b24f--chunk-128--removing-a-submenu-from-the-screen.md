#### **Removing a Submenu from the Screen**  
Assuming its application is active, an attached submenu can be removed from the screen in three ways:  
- By again choosing its controlling command. Choosing the Librarian command in the detached Services menu in the previous figure causes the Librarian submenu to disappear.
- By choosing any other command in the supermenu.
- By removing its supermenu from the screen. For example, when a tom-off supermenu is closed, its attached submenu disappears from the screen.  
A tom-off submenu is removed from the screen by clicking its close button.
