The user selects an object to distinguish it from other objects just before performing an operation on it. Selecting the object of an operation before identifying the operation is a fundamental characteristic of windowing software.  
Selecting an object has no effect on the contents of a document. Making a selection shouldn't commit the user to anything; the user is never penalized for making an incorrect selection. The user fixes an incorrect selection by making the correct selection.  
Although there is a variety of ways to select objects, they fall into easily recognizable groups. Users get used to doing specific things to select objects, and applications that use these methods are therefore easier to learn. Some of these methods apply to every type of application, and some only to particular types of applications.  
This section discusses first the general methods, and then the specific methods that apply to text applications, graphics applications, and arrays. Figure 6 shows a comparison of some of the general methods.
