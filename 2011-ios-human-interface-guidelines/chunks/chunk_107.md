On iPhone, a toolbar always appears at the bottom edge of a screen or view, but on iPad it can instead appear at the top edge.  
Toolbar items are displayed equally spaced across the width of the toolbar. The precise set of toolbar items can change from view to view, because the items are always specific to the context of the current view.

On iPhone, changing the device orientation from portrait to landscape can change the height of the toolbar automatically. On iPad, the height and translucency of a toolbar does not change with rotation.
