OS X makesit easy for appsto use the same anti-aliased, easy-to-read fontsthat users are accustomed to seeing throughout the system. OS X makesthese fonts available through Interface Builder and the NSFont class. Great apps use the system-provided fonts appropriately, which helps the UI stay subordinate to the user's content.  
The **system font** (Lucida Grande Regular 13 point) is used for text in menus, dialogs, and full-size controls.  
The **emphasized system font** (Lucida Grande Bold 13 point) is used sparingly, most often in the message of an alert.  
The **small system font** (Lucida Grande Regular 11 point) is used for the informative text in alerts. It is also the default font for column headings in lists, for help tags, and for small controls.  
The **emphasized small system font** (Lucida Grande Bold 11 point) is used occasionally, most often to title a group of settings that appear without a group box, or for brief informative text below a text field.  
The **mini system font** (Lucida Grande Regular 9 point) is used for mini controls. It is also used for panel labels and text.  
An **emphasized mini system font** (Lucida Grande Bold 9 point) is used in cases in which the emphasized small system font is too large.  
The **app font** (Lucida Grande Regular 13 point) is used as the default font for user-created content.  
The **label font** (Lucida Grande Regular 10 point) is used for the labels on toolbar buttons and to label tick marks on full-size sliders.  
The **view font** (Lucida Grande Regular 12 point) is the default font used for text in lists and tables.  
The Lucida Grande font family also includes mono-spaced numeric characters and variably-spaced alphabetics.  
Interface Builder automatically supplies the correct default font, based on the size and type of control being used. For more information about using fonts, see *Font Handling* .
