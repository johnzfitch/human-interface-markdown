<!-- Chunk 73 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 333 -->
The previous section describes how to use elements from the existing user interface. When you do use existing interface building blocks, use them in the standard way. Make sure you do *not* change the behavior for standard elements. When you need a new behavior, design a new element for it. If elements behave differently in different situations, the interface becomes unpredictable and harder to figure out.  
Consider an example of a palette that includes a subpalette. You might think of using the ellipsis character to indicate that the palette will display additional choices. However, using this symbol to indicate a subpalette gives it a meaning other than the standard meaning. In menus, the ellipsis character means that the user must provide more information before a command will operate. It doesn't mean that more information appears when the user chooses the item. This incorrect use of the ellipsis character is shown in Figure 3-3.

A better idea would be to use a right-pointing triangle; using it to indicate a subpalette would be analogous to using it to indicate a submenu. Figure 3-4 shows a triangle being used to indicate a subpalette.
