All interface element labels should be capitalized in either title style or sentence style. See [Table](#page-131-0) 10-2 (page 132) for examples of how to do this.  
Title style means that you capitalize every word except:  
■ Articles (*a, an, the*)  
- Coordinating conjunctions (*and, or*)
- Prepositions of four or fewer letters, except when the preposition is part of a verb phrase, as in "Starting Up the Computer."  
<span id="page-131-2"></span>In title style, always capitalize the first and last word, even if it is an article, a conjunction, or a preposition of four or fewer letters.  
<span id="page-131-6"></span><span id="page-131-0"></span>Sentence style means that the first word is capitalized, and the rest of the words are lowercase, unless they are proper nouns or proper adjectives. Use periods in dialogs only after complete sentences.
