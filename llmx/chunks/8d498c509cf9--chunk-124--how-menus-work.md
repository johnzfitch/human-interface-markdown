#### **How Menus Work**  
![](images/_page_112_Picture_1.jpeg)  
The main purpose of menus is to provide commands for the user to choose. To choose a menu command, the user presses the mouse button as the cursor points anywhere within the content area of the menu and releases it as the cursor points to the desired command. This can be as simple as clicking the command, or the user can drag through the menu, from command to command. Each command that comes under the cursor while the mouse button is down is highlighted.  
Instead of using the mouse, the user can often use a keyboard alternative to choose a command. A keyboard alternative is a combination of a character and the Command key. For example, holding down the Command key and pressing the **p** key is the standard keyboard alternative for the Print command. Keyboard alternatives are discussed in detail in Chapter 3, "User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse."
