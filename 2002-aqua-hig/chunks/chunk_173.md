The Escape (Esc) key basically means "let me out of here." It has specific meanings in certain contexts. The user can press Escape in the following situations:  
- in a dialog, instead of clicking Cancel
- to stop an operation in progress (such as printing), instead of pressing Command-period
- to cancel renaming a file or an item in a list
- to cancel a drag in progress  
<span id="page-168-2"></span>Pressing Escape should never cause the user to back out of an operation that would require extensive time or work to reenter. When the user presses Escape during a lengthy operation, display a confirmation dialog to be sure that the key wasn't pressed accidentally.
