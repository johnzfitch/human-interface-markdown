## **Action Paradigms**

Graphical user interfaces such as NeXTSTEP work best when there are well-defined paradigms for using the mouse. The paradigms must be broad enough to encompassactions for the widest possible variety of applications, yet precise and limited enough so that users are always aware of what actions are possible and appropriate.

The NeXTSTEP user interface supports these three paradigms of mouse action:

- Direct manipulation
- Targeted action
- Modal tool
