<span id="page-122-10"></span><span id="page-122-9"></span>Because dragging is defined as moving the mouse while the mouse button is held down, a mouse-down event must occur before dragging can take place. A selection can be made as a result of this mouse-down event, just before the user starts dragging. For example, the user can select and drag a folder icon in a single gesture; the user does not have to click the folder icon first, release the mouse button, and then press again to begin dragging the icon. Your application should ensure that implicit selection occurs, when appropriate, when the user starts dragging.  
Single-gesture selection and dragging is possible only when the process ofselecting an item does not require dragging. Range-selection operations—such as selecting text or multiple graphic objects—don't lend themselves to single-gesture selection and dragging because the range-selection operation itself requires dragging.
