Some apps might need to give users a way to make setup or configuration choices, but most apps can avoid or delay doing this. Successful apps work well for most people right away and offer some ways to adjust the user experience within the main UI.  
**If possible, avoid sending users to Settings.** It's important to remember that users can't open the Settings app without first switching away from your app, and you don't want to encourage this action.  
When you design your app to function the way most of your users expect, you decrease the need for settings. If you need information about the user, query the system for it instead of asking users to provide it. If you decide you must provide app settings that users rarely need to change, see "The Settings Bundle" in *iOS App Programming Guide* to learn how to support them in your code.  
**If necessary, let users set behaviors they want within your app.** Integrating configuration options into your app lets you react dynamically to changes because people don't have to leave your app to set them.  
**As much as possible, offer configuration options in the main UI.** Putting options in the main UI can make sense if they represent a primary task and if people might want to change them frequently. If people are likely to change an app's configuration only occasionally, it makes sense to put them in a separate view.
