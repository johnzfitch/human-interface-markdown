## **Inspector Panels**

An inspector panel is any panel that displays information about the object that's currently selected. Inspectors usually let the user set properties of the object, as well. The Font panel (described in "Standard Panels" later in this chapter) is an inspector panel. It displays information about the font of the current selection. The Workspace Manager Inspector panel (shown below) lets the user see and set information about the currently selected file or folder. Inspectors are often multiform panels, with each form displaying a different kind of information about an object.
