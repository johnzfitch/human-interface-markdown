<span id="page-76-3"></span>Including system requirements on your packaging is critical. Be sure to identify which version of Mac OS X is required for your software to run. Mac OS X runs on three different processors, the G3, G4, and G5. If you have features that specifically require one of those processors, make sure it's clearly stated in your system requirements. Be sure to test on as wide a variety of configurations as you can. If you know your application does not work under certain conditions, make that clear by stating it on your packaging.  
ADC members can take advantage of the ADC Compatibility Labs to test applications on a variety of different types of hardware and operating system versions. The labs are equipped with every supported model of Macintosh and every Apple display. Lab technicians can install different versions of operating systems on these machines. This is an excellent resource for you to test your software in many different environments.
