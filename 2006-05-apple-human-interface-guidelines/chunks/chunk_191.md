The primary purpose of a toolbar is to provide users with easy access to frequently used commands. Although toolbar icons should conserve screen real estate (32 pixels by 32 pixels is the recommended size), they should be inviting and easy to identify. The perspective of a toolbar icon is straight-on, as if it is sitting on a shelf in front of you.  
Ideally, each toolbar icon should represent a unique object or action that is directly related to the command itrepresents. A toolbar can also contain icons thatrepresentrecognizable interface elements from elsewhere in the system (such as an Info button or an iDisk icon) when they make sense in the context of the application. If you choose to include an icon such as an Info button, be sure to preserve its meaning. Users expect such icons to mean the same thing in every context, so you should not redefine them when you use them in your toolbar.

A system icon provides important information to the user in a specific context, such as in an alert window; using it in a toolbar blurs its meaning and dilutes it effectiveness in the system.  
Figure 10-14 shows some of the icons available in Xcode's toolbar (Xcode is the Mac OS X integrated development environment, or IDE).

Some of the icons in Figure 10-14 use familiar objects (a hammer, a can of bug spray, and a broom) as metaphors for frequently used Xcode commands (build a project, debug code, and clean a target, respectively). To represent the run action, Xcode uses the right-pointing triangle users associate with play or run in applications such as iTunes, Keynote, and Automator. The Xcode toolbar also contains the Info button users are accustomed to seeing in the Finder and in other applications in Mac OS X. As a general rule, a toolbar icon that depicts an identifiable, real-world object or recognizable user-interface elementgives first-time users a clue to its function and helps experienced users remember it.  
Making each toolbar icon distinct helps the user associate it with its purpose and locate it quickly. Variations in shape, color, and image all help to differentiate one toolbar icon from another. At the same time, however, an application's toolbar icons should harmonize together as much as possible in their perspective, use of color, size, and visual weight. For example, each icon in Figure 10-14 is unique, but all are similarin general size, perspective, and color saturation (intensity) and none appear more important than the others.  
<span id="page-137-0"></span>Although icons designed specifically for use in a toolbar appear as if they are sitting on a shelf in front ofyou, ifyou use a recognizable control from elsewhere in the interface (such as a pop-up menu), that control should retain its standard appearance and perspective. That is, don't redesign a toolbar version of a well-known interface element.

<span id="page-137-1"></span>Creating a family of visually related toolbar icons can strengthen the user's perception of your application as beingwell-integrated andwell-designed. Onewayto do this is to startwith a consistent theme for the style and appearance of the icons, then introduce variations when it makes sense. You might also consider usinga variation of the application icon or an image symbolic ofyour application's purpose as a common element in toolbar icons. For example, Preview reuses the photo from its application icon in some of its toolbar icons, as shown in Figure 10-16.
