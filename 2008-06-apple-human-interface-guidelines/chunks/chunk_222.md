<span id="page-174-6"></span><span id="page-174-5"></span>In general, each command in the **File menu** should apply to a single file (most commonly, a user-created document).  
Note that the Preferences and Quit commands, which apply to a whole application, are in the application menu. If your application provides document-specific preferences, make them available in the File menu, preferably right above printing commands. If an application is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate or eliminate it.  
<span id="page-174-1"></span>Several items in the File menu—Save As, Print, and Page Setup, for example—should open sheets. For more information, see "Sheets [\(Document-Modal](#page-230-1) Dialogs)" (page 231).

<span id="page-174-3"></span>Standard File menu commands include these:  
<span id="page-174-2"></span>**New (Command-N).** Opens a new document named "untitled" (or "untitled 2," and so on, as appropriate). If your application requires documentsto be named upon creation, you can display a Save dialog (see ["Dialogs](#page-240-0) for Saving, Closing, and [Quitting"](#page-240-0) (page 241)). For more information about naming new document windows, see "Opening [Windows"](#page-210-1) (page 211).  
<span id="page-174-4"></span>**Open… (Command-O).** Displays a dialog for choosing an existing document to open. Note that in the Finder, the Open command is not followed by an ellipsis character because the user performs navigation and document selection before selecting the Open command. For more information, see "The [Open](#page-239-0) [Dialog"](#page-239-0) (page 240).  
**Open Recent.** TheOpen command can be followed byOpen Recentso that people can open recently opened documents without using the Open dialog. The Open Recent submenu displays documents in the order in which they were opened, with the most recent item at the top. This optional command is most useful in office-productivity or other document-based applications. Note that the ability to open recent documents and applications is provided by the Apple menu in the Recent Items menu item.  
If you choose to include the Open Recent command, be sure to display document names only; don't display file paths. Users have their own ways of keeping track of which documents are which and file paths are inappropriate to display unless specifically requested by the user.  
<span id="page-175-0"></span>**Close (Command-W).** Closes the active window. When the user chooses this command and the active document has been changed since lastsaved, display the Save Changes alert (see ["Dialogsfor](#page-240-0) Saving, Closing, and [Quitting"](#page-240-0) (page 241)). When the user presses the Option key, Close changes to Close All. The keyboard shortcuts Command-W and Command-Option-W should implement the Close and Close All commands, respectively.  
<span id="page-175-1"></span>**Close File (Command-Shift-W).** In a file-based application that supports multiple views of the same file, you can include a Close File command below Close Window to close a file and all its associated windows. If possible, include the filename in the menu (for example, Close File "Book Report").  
<span id="page-175-3"></span>**Save (Command-S).** Saves the active document, leaves the document open, and provides feedback indicating that the document is being (or has been) saved. If the document has not previously been saved, dim the Save command and make sure the Save As command is active instead. If an open document has been previously saved and the user has made no changes to it, the Save command is dimmed.  
<span id="page-175-4"></span>**Save As… (Command-Shift-S).** Displays the Save dialog (described in "Save [Dialogs"](#page-240-2) (page 241)), which allows the user to save a copy of the active document with a new user-defined name, a new location, or both. The newly saved document remains open and active and displaysthe new name (if the user has changed it). The previously saved version of the document retains its name, location, and format, and remains closed. If the document has not previously been saved, the Save command is dimmed and the Save As command is active.  
Avoid providing multiple Save As *File Format* menu commands that each save the document in a different file format. Instead, use the Format pop-up menu in the Save dialog to present the user with a selection of file formats. For example, the Format pop-up menu in Safari's Save dialog allows the user to save the current content of the window as a web archive or a page source.  
<span id="page-175-9"></span>If your application needs to allow users to continue working on the active document, but save a copy of the document in a format your application doesn't handle, you can provide an Export As command.  
<span id="page-175-5"></span>**Note:** Avoid using Save a Copy or Save To commands. The functionality users associate with these commands is provided by the Save As and Export As commands.  
<span id="page-175-7"></span>**Export As…** Displaysthe Save dialog (described in "Save [Dialogs"](#page-240-2) (page 241)) to allow the user to save a copy of the active document in a format your application does not handle. As with the Save As command, the user is given the option to choose a new user-defined name, location, or both. Unlike the Save As command, however, it isthe original document thatshould remain open so the user can continue working in the current format; the newly saved document should not automatically open. Provide this command if your application needs to allow a user to work with a document in one format and save a copy of that document in a format your application doesn't handle. Be sure to change the label of the document name text field of the Save dialog from "Save As:" to "Export As:".  
<span id="page-175-6"></span><span id="page-175-2"></span>**Save All.** Saves changes to all open documents.  
<span id="page-175-8"></span>**Revertto Saved.** Discards all changes made to the active documentsince the last time it wassaved or opened. When the user chooses Revert to Saved, display an alert that warns the user about the potential data loss the operation will cause.  
**Print… (Command-P).** Opens the standard Print dialog, which allows users to print to a printer, to send a fax, or to save as a PDF file. For more information, see "The Print [Dialog"](#page-246-0) (page 247).  
<span id="page-176-3"></span>**Page Setup… (Command-Shift-P).** Opens a dialog for specifying printing parameters such as paper size and printing orientation. These parameters are saved with the document.
