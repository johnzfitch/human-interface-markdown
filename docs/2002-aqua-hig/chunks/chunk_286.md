To minimize speech-recognition errors, observe the following guidelines in designing your spoken interface.  
- Avoid commands that sound similar but have different meanings. For example, "Turn backups on" and "Turn backups off" differ by only one phoneme and might be confused by the recognizer in a noisy environment.
- Avoid single-word commands; they are less distinctive and can be confused by the recognizer. "Cut" sounds similar to "Quit," for example. Phrases that are from three to six words long are more distinctive and will be better recognized.
- Define commands that are easy to remember, feel natural to say, and don't conflict with menu items or controls.
- Provide speech-recognition commands that add value by doing more than can be accomplished through a single click or keyboard equivalent.  
- If a certain action is made available through speech, make sure that tasks involving this action can be completed via speech. If confirmation is required, make sure the user can speak the response (instead of forcing the user to type something, for example). Users prefer to stay in one mode rather than switching back and forth depending on the task.
- For commands that could result in data loss, ask for confirmation before executing the command.
- Don't make speech the only way for the user to accomplish a task; always provide an alternative method.
