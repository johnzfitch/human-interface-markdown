The angles and shadows used in various kinds of icons are intended to reflect how the objects would appear in the real world. It'simportant to learn which perspective is associated with each icon genre so that your icons look at home on the platform.  
Different perspectives are achieved by changing the position of an imaginary camera that captures the icon. The perceived light source that is causing the shadows is always directly above the object.  
An app icon depicts an object that looks like it is sitting on a desk in front of you.

Utility icons are depicted as if they were on a shelf in front of you. Flat objects appear as if there were a wall behind them, with an appropriate shadow behind the object.

A three-dimensional object, such as a rocket, is more realistically viewed as resting on the ground. To depict the rocket, an icon shows it sitting on a shelf with its shadow below it.

For toolbar icons, the perspective is also straight-on, asif the object is on a shelf in front of you, with the shadow below it. (For more information on designing toolbar icons, see ["Designing](#page-120-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 121).)

**Portray real objects accurately.** Icons that represent real objects should also look as though they are made of real materials and have real mass. Realistic icons accurately replicate the characteristics of substances such as fabric, glass, paper, and metal, and convey an object's weight and feel.  
**Make your drop shadow fully black.** In the Finder Cover Flow view, icons are displayed against a black background, set above a highly reflective surface. If your icon has a drop shadow that contains any gray tones, the gray will make the shadow look more like a glow.  
**Consider adding a slight glow justinside the edges of youricon.** If your icon includes a dark reflective surface, such as glass or metal, add an inner glow to make the icon stand out against the black background. If you don't add a glow to make the edges of your icon prominent, it might appear to dissolve into the black background of the Finder Cover Flow view.  
**Use transparency when it makes sense.** Transparency in an icon can help depict glass or plastic, but it can be tricky to use convincingly. You would never see a transparent tree, for example, so don't use one in your icon. The Preview and Pages app icons incorporate transparency effectively.
