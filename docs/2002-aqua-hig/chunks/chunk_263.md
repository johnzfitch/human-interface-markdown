**Title style** means that you capitalize every word except  
- articles (*a, an, the*)
- coordinating conjunctions (*and, or*)
- prepositions of three or fewer letters, except when the preposition is part of a verb phrase, as in Starting Up the Computer.  
In title style, always capitalize the first and last word, even if it is an article, a conjunction, or a preposition of three or fewer letters.
