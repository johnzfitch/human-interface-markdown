Understand the purpose of the graphic before you begin design work. What is the purpose of a dialog box? Are you allowing the user to choose settings? To move files? To edit a pattern? Or to change a name? Users need to be able to find their way around in a dialog or alert in order to know how to respond to it. Sometimes a picture is not the answer—there may be times when words are better. What information is being requested? Where do does the user enter it? How does the user make the thing go away? What title in the button makes the most sense?  
Make graphics clear and readable. Try them out on end users, not just on your fellow artists or programmers. The path that the user's eye and mind take through a dialog box must be as clear as a pane of glass. The most important part of the graphic should be recognized first, then the second most important part, and so on. Use visual clues such as arrows, movement, and the arrangement of elements to direct the eye to the correct place. The default button in a dialog box, with a darker outline than that of the other buttons, is a good example of this. The symbols used in different kinds of alerts tell the user if the alert is a note, caution, or warning. The placement of certain elements tells users immediately what they are dealing with: an icon in the upper left corner of a box mean it is some kind of alert; the double line around a dialog box (instead of the normal title bar) distinguished it from a window.  
Animation, when used sparingly, is one of the best ways to draw the user's attention to a particular place on the screen (the quickest way to find a pointer on a busy screen is to move the mouse, causing the pointer to move). Animated pointers can be used to reassure the user, during a lengthy process such as saving a large document to disk, that the system is alive and well.
