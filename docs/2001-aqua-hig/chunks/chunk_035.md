Make sure that visible interface elements can be localized (translated into other languages and adapted for use in other countries). Whenever you design a user interface, consider that various regions of the world may differ in their use of color, graphics, calendars, text, and the representation of time. Specific objects or symbols (such as wall outlets and the \$ sign) may also have a different appearance, or not be understood, in other countries.  
Graphics can enhance your application, but certain images can be offensive to certain audiences. Cultures assign varying values and characteristics to living creatures, plants, and inanimate objects. For example, in the United States the owl is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, whereas in Central America the owl represents witchcraft and black magic. It's a good idea to avoid the use of seasons, holidays, or calendar events in software that you expect to distribute worldwide. If you include images that represent holidays or seasons—such as Christmas trees, pumpkins, or snow—be sure they can be localized.  
Different calendars are used to mark time around the world. The United States and most of Europe observe time according the Gregorian calendar. The traditional Arabic calendar, the Jewish calendar, and the Chinese calendar are lunar rather than solar. In many places, time is marked according to one calendar for business and government purposes and another for religious events. Make your application flexible in handling dates; you also may want to provide the user with a way to change the representation of time. Use the text utilities to handle numbers, dates, and sorting.
