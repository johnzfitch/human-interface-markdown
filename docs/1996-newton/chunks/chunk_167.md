There are some alternatives to the Action picker method of routing. For example, the Calls application has a Place Call button for routing an outgoing phone call. Tapping the Place Call button displays a routing slip for the call transport. The Call routing slip is similar to a Fax routing slip. In the upper part of the Call routing slip a user specifies the caller, the caller's location, and the call recipient (see ["Sender Picker" on page 7-13](#page-218-0) and ["Choosing Fax](#page-221-0)  [or E-mail Recipients" on page 7-16\)](#page-221-0). In the lower part of the Call routing slip, a picker and a button control how the call is dialed. Figure 7-24 shows a sample Call routing slip.
