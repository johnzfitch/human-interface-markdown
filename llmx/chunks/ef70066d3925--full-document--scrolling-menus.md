## Scrolling menus

If a menu contains too many items to display at once, on a Macintosh Plus the menu scrolls to reveal the hidden items. This feature was devised only for the menus to which the user can add many items—the Font menu specifically. Application programmers should not create menus that are too long to be seen without scrolling.
