Buttons initiate an immediate action. There are several types of buttons in OS X, each of which is well suited to a certain set of tasks. As you design your app's user interface, be sure to select the appropriate button for each job. The guidelines in the following sections help you use each type of button correctly.  
**Important:** The buttons described in the following sections are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the toolbar or bottom bar. The single exception is the icon button, which can also be used in a preferences window toolbar. To learn about controls that are designed specifically for use in the toolbar and bottom-bar areas in your window, see ["Window-Frame](#page-240-0) Controls" (page 241).
