Personal digital assistants introduce a new level of complexity for many people. To cope with this complexity, people need some stable reference points. The Newton interface is designed to provide an environment that is understandable, familiar, and predictable. It defines a number of regular interface elements to foster a perception of stability, including view borders, view titles, folder tabs, standard buttons, and standard button locations. Each of these elements has a specific look and a regular, predictable behavior. In addition, the interface defines a clear, finite set of basic data objects—text, ink text, shapes, and sketches—and a clear, finite set of editing commands with which users can create and manipulate the objects. Your application can share and enhance the stability by using the regular interface elements and handling data objects in the customary manner.
