## **Using the Save Panel**

This Application Kit panel should come up showing the folder of the document being saved (the document in the main window). A document's folder is reflected in its window's title bar. For example, if the title bar shows

UNTITLED-1 - INet/machine/home

then the Save panel should come up showing lNetimachinelhome.
