Toolbar icons represent frequently used commands in an application. Typically, toolbar icons are not as rich in detail and photo-realism as other icon types, because they are intended to be small, streamlined representations of application-specific objects and tasks. For example, Keynote toolbar icons (some of which are shown in Figure 11-11) have more in common with sketches than with photographs, using simple shapes, constrained shading, and just enough detail to suggest each item.
