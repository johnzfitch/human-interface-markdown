<span id="page-88-5"></span>There are four kinds of keys: character keys, modifier keys, arrow keys, and function keys. A **character key**sends a character to the computer. When the user holds down a **modifier key,** it alters the meaning of the character key being pressed or the meaning of a mouse action.  
**Note:** Not all the keys described here exist on all keyboards. Don't depend on a key as the only way for users to accomplish a task. You cannot assume anything about which keyboard (if any) is connected to a computer.
