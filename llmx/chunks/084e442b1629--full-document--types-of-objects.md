### Types of objects

Strictly speaking, *everything* on a Macintosh screen is displayed graphically. Still, it's useful to distinguish among three types of objects—text, graphics, and lists or arrays—because the user deals with each of them in a different way. Figure 3-52 shows an example of each.
