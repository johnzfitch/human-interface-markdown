The In/Out Box shows the same header information for each item it displays in the In Box or Out Box. Each item's header consists of an icon that identifies the transport, followed by the item's title and status. A second line shows the name of the sender or recipient, followed by the date and time the item was put in the In/Out Box. [Table 7-1](#page-210-0) explains the meanings of the standard status words displayed in the In/Out Box headers.
