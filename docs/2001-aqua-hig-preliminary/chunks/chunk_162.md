Here are some guidelines to help you create effective tag messages.  
- Use the fewest words possible. Try to keep your tags to a maximum of 60 to 75 characters. Help Tags are always on (they appear whenever a user hovers over an item), so it is important to keep your tag text unobtrusive—that is, *short*—and useful. Present one concept per tag and make sure the concept is directly related to the item in question. Localization lengthens the text by 20 to 30 percent, which is another good reason to keep the tag short.
- Describe what the user will accomplish. The tag should say what the user wants to know most—what task the user can accomplish by using the item. If absolutely necessary, you can give more information after describing what will be accomplished.
- Create tags that are applicable to all situations. Help Tags are not contextually sensitive; the same text appears when an item is selected, dimmed, and so on. By describing what the item accomplishes, you may help the user understand the current state of the control.
- Use Help Tags to provide functional information for controls that are unique to your application. Don't tag window controls, scroll bars, and other parts of the standard Mac OS X interface.
- Don't put the item's name in the tag unless the name helps the user and isn't available onscreen. If an item is referred to by name in the documentation and in the tag, make sure the names match.

- You can use a sentence fragment beginning with a verb, for example, "Restores default settings." You can also omit articles to limit the size of the tag. If the tag text is a complete sentence, end it with a period.
- Describe only the item the user points to.
- Use hints sparingly.
- Don't write tags for menus and menu items.

In these examples, only the text after the colon appears in the tag. Note that in Mail, some tags include the button name, but the text contains information ("selected," for example) that helps explain why the control might be dimmed.

<span id="page-178-3"></span><span id="page-178-0"></span>Although Mac OS X uses graphics as a primary means of user-computer interaction, text is still very prevalent throughout the interface for such things as button names, pop-up menu labels, dialog messages, and onscreen help. Using text consistently and clearly is a critical component of interface design.  
Your product team should include a skilled writer who is responsible for reviewing all user-visible onscreen text as well as creating the instructional documentation.
