<span id="page-186-9"></span>If your application provides onscreen help, the **Help menu** should be the rightmost menu of your application's menus. If you have registered your help book (see *Apple Help Programming Guide* for information on how to do this), the system provides the Spotlight For Help search field as the first item in the menu. The item after the Spotlight For Help search field isthe name of your application and the word "Help"(Mail Help, for example). This item should open Help Viewer to the first page of your help content. It's good to have only one custom item in the Help menu, but if you do have more items, they should appear below the *ApplicationName* Help item. Additional items that are unrelated to help content, such as arbitrary website links, registration information, or release notes can be linked to within your help book instead of being separate items in your help menu.  
<span id="page-186-1"></span>Avoid using the Help menu as a table of contents for your help book. When they click the *ApplicationName* Help item in them menu, users can see the sections in your help book in the Help Viewer window. If you choose to provide additional links into your help content within the Help menu, be sure they are distinct. Figure 13-23 shows the iTunes Help menu.
