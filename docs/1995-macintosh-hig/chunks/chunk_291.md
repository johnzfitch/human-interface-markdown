Use similar wording in similar balloons to make it easier for the user to read the balloon messages. Unnecessary variations in wording are distracting. Using phrasing similar to that described here will help your users quickly assimilate the information since the structure of the information will be familiar.  
#### Buttons With Words 11  
For buttons that appear in dialog boxes, use the construction  
"To [perform action], click this button."  
Figure 11-9 shows an example of a help balloon for a button.

#### <span id="page-343-0"></span>Menu Titles 11  
For pull-down menu titles, give the title of the menu and then describe what kinds of commands are in the menu. You provide the title of the menu because some menus on the menu bar are icons, not words. Figure 11-10 shows an example of this type of help balloon.

For pop-up menus, describe what to do with the menu. Don't give the menu a name. For example, you could say, "Use this pop-up menu to describe items you want to find."  
#### Menu Items 11  
Don't name the individual items in a menu. Begin with a verb describing what happens when you choose the item. Figure 11-11 shows an example of a help balloon for a common menu item and an example of how to write a help balloon for the same menu item when it's unavailable (dimmed).

#### <span id="page-344-0"></span>Language  
For menu items that require more information and display a dialog box, it's not necessary to say that a dialog box appears. The user wants to know what choosing the menu item ultimately accomplishes.
