<!-- Chunk 35 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 201 -->
RETURN is a character. It may be part of a search pattern, for example, which is not true of BACKSPACE. In the word processor, RETURN is used to delimit a paragraph. When RETURN is typed, the selection is deleted, and a mandatory line break inserted.  
RETURN has a somewhat different meaning within a field of a form. If the entire field is selected, RETURN means the same as tab. If the selection is anywhere in a single line field, RETURN means the same as tab. If the selection is just a caret and is at the end of the last line of a field, RETURN means the same as tab. Otherwise if the selection is in a multi-line field, RETURN deletes the selection and inserts a line break. If the additional line of text doesn't fit within the field, RETURN will just beep.  
Shift-RETURN acts the same as RETURN.
