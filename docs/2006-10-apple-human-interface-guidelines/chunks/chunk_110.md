Clicking has two components: pushing down on the mouse button and releasing it without moving the mouse. (If the mouse moves between button down and button up, it's *dragging,* not clicking.)  
The effect of a click should be immediate and obvious. If the function of the click is to cause an action (such as clicking a button), the *selection is made* when the button is pressed, and the *action takes place* when the button is released. For example, if a user presses down the mouse button while the pointer is over an onscreen button, thereby putting the button in a selected state, and then moves the pointer *off* the button before releasingthe mouse button, the onscreen button is not clicked. If the user presses an onscreen button and rolls over another button before releasingthe mouse, neither button is clicked.
