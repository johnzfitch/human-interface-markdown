A rectangular-style toolbar button can contain either text or icons. In addition, this button can contain a downward-pointing arrow that indicates the presence of a pop-up menu. A rectangular-style toolbar segmented control can also contain either text or icons, but should not contain a mix of text and icons.  
If you display an icon in a rectangular toolbar control, be sure the meaning of the image is clear and unambiguous (see ["Cultural](#page-46-2) Values" (page 47) for some advice on choosing appropriate imagery). In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, Interface Builder makes it easy to add to a control one of the system-provided images, such as the plus sign, the accounts symbol, or the locked symbol. You can see some of these symbols in the controls in the Finder toolbar, shown in [Figure](#page-250-0) 15-2 (page 251). See ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) Images" (page 151) for more information on standard images available in Mac OS X v10.5 and later. If you need to design your own image,see "Designing Iconsfor [Rectangular-Style](#page-149-1) Toolbar Controls" (page 150) forsome metrics and guidelines.  
If you want to display text in a rectangular-style toolbar control, be sure it is either a noun (or noun phrase) that describes an object, setting, or state, or that it is a verb (or verb phrase) that describes an action. For example, the nouns used in the iCal toolbar controls clearly indicate the function of the controls. Text in rectangular-style toolbar controlsshould have title-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-130-1) of Interface Element [Labels](#page-130-1) and Text" (page 131) for more on this style).  
If you use a rectangular-style toolbar control that behaves like a checkbox or a toggle button in a toolbar or bottom bar, you may be able to benefit from the automatic highlighting that signifies the on state of the button. If you do this, however, be very sure the control clearly indicates the correct state in the correct situation. Also, if you put such a control in a toolbar, you should provide two descriptive labels that can be displayed below the control. One label should describe the on (or pressed) state and one should describe the off (or unpressed) state. Finally, be sure to describe both of the states in the control's help tag, whether the control appears in a toolbar or a bottom bar. To learn more about the on-state appearance, see ["Rectangular-Style](#page-253-1) Toolbar Control Implementation" (page 254).  
For example, iCal offers toggle controls in its bottom bar that allow users to show or hide various views. When one of these views is visible, the associated toggle control is highlighted; when the view is hidden, the highlighting disappears. Figure 15-4 shows the iCal bottom bar, along with a help tag that describes both states.

**Important:** You must supply a descriptive label for each rectangular-style toolbar control you place in a toolbar so that users can customize the toolbar to display both images and text. This is the external label users see when they select the Icon & Text or Text Only display options in the Customize Toolbar dialog. Rectangular style toolbar controls used in a bottom bar do not need external descriptive labels.
