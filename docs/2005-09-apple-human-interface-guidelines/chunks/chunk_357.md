#### Layout Examples  
Like small controls, mini controls have specific spacingguidelines. In addition to the spacingguidelines in ["Controls"](#page-220-0) (page 221) the following guidelines are illustrated in Figure 15-17:  
- Side borders should be 10 pixels.
- Bottom borders should be 12 pixels.
- Groups of controls should be separated by at least 8 pixels.  
In Figure 15-17, note that as with small controls, the buttons in the toolbar are big enough to accommodate 16 x 16 icons. Note also the use of separatorswithin the tab viewinstead ofgroup boxes or white space; they allow for an more compact window. More examples of using separators are illustrated in ["Grouping](#page-293-0) Controls" (page 294).
