A menu presents a list of items—commands, attributes, or states—from which a user can choose.  
Menus have a few different forms in OS X.

A **menu bar menu** displays the current app's commands in the single menu bar at the top of the display. An app typically displays several menus in the menu bar. For an overview of the menu bar, see Menu Bar [Menus](#page-86-0) (page 87).  
A **contextual menu** displays commands that are directly related to an item. To reveal a contextual menu, users Control-click an onscreen area or a selection.

A **Dock menu** contains system-defined commands (such as Reveal in Finder and Keep in Dock) and, optionally, app-specific commands (such as New Window). To reveal a Dock menu, users Control-click or press and hold an app's Dock icon.  
By default, all types of menus in Yosemite use vibrancy.  
**Note:** Pop-up menus and command pop-down menus are controlsthat also display menus(to learn more about these controls,see Menu [Controls](#page-189-0) (page 190)). Because the menusin these controlsshare several characteristics with app menus, some menu guidelines apply to both.
