Gradient buttons should contain images; they should not contain text. Because the function of a gradient button is closely tied to the view with which it's associated, there's little need to describe its action using a label.  
When possible, you should use the system-provided images, such as the Action menu image and the Add image, because their meaning is familiar to users. You should create a custom image only when none of the system-provided images is suitable. See ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) Images" (page 151) for more information on the system-provided images available to you. If you decide to create your own icons to use in a gradient button, see "Designing Icons for [Rectangular-Style](#page-149-1) Toolbar Controls" (page 150) for some guidelines on how to do this.
