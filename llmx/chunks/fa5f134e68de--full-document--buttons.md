#### **Buttons**

Buttons are the primary controls for starting an action or setting a state. Users manipulate buttons by moving the mouse so that the cursor is over the button, and then clicking—pressing and releasing the mouse button.

Buttons can be very basic—with just a word or picture on a rectangular, raised-looking button—or they can be more complex. The following figure shows some simple buttons that are typical of those used to start actions.

Another kind of button that initiates actions is one that controls a *pull-down list*. A pull-down list is a combination of a button and a menulike list. The button itself doesn't cause an action (other than displaying the list), but it lets the user choose a list item that causes an action. For example:

Buttons that set a state, as opposed to initiating an action, tend to be a little more complex than action buttons. Typical state buttons are shown in the figure below.

A pop-up list, like a pull-down list, is a combination of a button and a list. A pop-up list's button doesn't actually set a state, but it brings up a menulike list from which the user can choose an option that sets the state. Unlike a pull-down list, the title of a pop-up list's button changes to display the list item that was chosen (such as from Inches to Centimeters).
