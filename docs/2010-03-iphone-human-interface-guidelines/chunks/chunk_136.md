iPhone OS provides the standard icons described in Table 10-3 for use in tab bars. Information on symbol names and availability for these icons is in documentation for UITabBarSystemItem.  
<span id="page-125-2"></span>As with all standard buttons and icons, it's essential to use these icons in accordance with their documented meanings. In particular, take care to base your usage of an icon on its semantic meaning, not its appearance. This will help your application's user interface make sense even if the icon associated with a specific meaning changes its appearance. See "Using [System-Provided](#page-122-1) Buttons and Icons" (page 123) for further reasons why it's important to use these icons correctly.
