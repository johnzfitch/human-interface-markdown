In **default keyboard access mode,** focus moves only between fields that receive keyboard input. Mac OS X also provides the option of **full keyboard access mode,** in which users can navigate through windows and dialogs. This section discusses the default keyboard access mode.

When using the mouse is undesirable, difficult, or impossible, users can move the onscreen focus (highlight) with the keyboard to access text entry fields, list boxes that support type-ahead, scrolling lists, column views, and list views. In Roman systems, focus always begins at the first field that accepts keyboard input and follows a reading path from upper left to bottom right.
