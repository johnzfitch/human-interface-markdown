## **Limitation on Warranties and Liability**

Even though Apple has tested the software described in this manual and reviewed its contents, neither Apple nor its software suppliers make any warranty or representation, either express or implied, with respect to this manual or to the software described in this manual, their quality, performance, merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose. As a result, this software and manual are sold "as is", and you the purchaser are assuming the entire risk as to their quality and performance. In no event will Apple or its software suppliers be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from any defect in the software or manual, even if they have been advised of the possibility of such damages. In particular, they shall have no liability for any programs or data stored in or used with Apple products, including the costs of recovering or reproducing these programs or data. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
