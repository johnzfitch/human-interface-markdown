#### WYSIWYG

A fundamental principle of the Apple Desktop Interface is that the user sees on the screen exactly what he will later get on paper. On the Macintosh, this principle is taken to the extent that the size of an object on the screen is exactly the size it'll be when printed on paper. People who use applications such as MacWrite or MacPaint take for granted the idea of WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). Applications violate this principle when, for example, they display editing marks that are supposed to represent how a text sequence or image will appear on paper.

Users should not have to make any mental transformation between their computer work and the end products of that work. The computer itself can handle these transformations. In this sense, the computer really becomes a thinking tool as well as a simple production tool.
