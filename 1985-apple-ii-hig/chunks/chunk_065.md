Text is used in most applications; it's selected and edited in a consistent way, regardless of where it appears.  
A block of text is a string of characters. A text selection is a substring of this string, which can have any length from zero characters to the whole block. Each of the text selection methods selects a different kind of substring. Figure 8 shows different kinds of text selections.
