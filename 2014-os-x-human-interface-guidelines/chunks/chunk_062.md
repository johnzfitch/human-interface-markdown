The single menu bar at the top of the main display screen provides a home for the top-level menus in your app. In addition to system-provided and user-assigned items, you determine the menus that appear in the menu bar.  
As you can see here, menu bar menus use the current appearance of the menu bar.

The following sections contain guidelinesthat help you choose which menus you need and which menu items you should include.  
**Important:** Some menu items are marked as expected, which means that you should include them in your app, unless it's impossible to support them. Include other menu items when they make sense in your app.  
When there's an appropriate keyboard shortcut for a menu item, it islisted. In general, enable the appropriate keyboard shortcut for every expected menu item in your app. Provide a keyboard shortcut for other items only if the item will be frequently used. (To learn more about providing keyboard shortcuts for menu items, see [Providing](#page-296-1) Keyboard Shortcuts (page 297).)
