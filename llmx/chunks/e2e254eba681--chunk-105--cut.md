#### Cut  
The Cut command removes data that the user selects prior to choosing the command. People use the Cut command to delete the current selection or to move it. Store the cut selection on the Clipboard, replacing its previous contents.  
Make the area active where the cut selection was. The visual indicators vary by application type. For example, a word processor would display a blinking insertion point at the spot where the text was cut. In an array, the user would see an empty but highlighted cell. If the user chooses Paste immediately after choosing Cut, restore the document to the state it was in just before the cut operation.  
The Command-X combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Cut command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
