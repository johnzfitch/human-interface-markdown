Every menu is a sticky menu: When a user clicks the menu title, the menu stays open without the user having to continue holding down the mouse button. The user can then move the pointer to an item to select it.  
In Mac OS X, every menu is sticky and stays open until another action forces it to close. Such actions include  
- a click on another menu, window, control, or application
- a system-initiated alert
- a system-initiated application switch or quit  
<span id="page-39-4"></span><span id="page-39-3"></span>If a sticky menu contains a submenu, it should also be sticky. If your application uses standard system menus, they assume proper sticky behavior.
