Although crisp, beautiful UI and fluid motion are highlights of the iOS 7 experience, the user's content is at its heart.  
Here are some ways to make sure that your designs elevate functionality and defer to the user's content.

**Take advantage of the whole screen.** Reconsider the use of insets and visual frames and—instead—let the content extend to the edges of the screen. Weather is a great example of this approach: The beautiful, full-screen depiction of a location's current weather instantly conveys the most important information, with room to spare for hourly data.  
#### **Reconsider visual indicators of physicality and realism.**  
Bezels, gradients, and drop shadowssometimeslead to heavier UI elementsthat can overpower or compete with the content. Instead, focus on the content and let the UI play a supporting role.

**Let translucent UI elements hint at the content behind them.** Translucent elements—such as Control Center—provide context, help userssee that more content is available, and can signal transience. In iOS 7, a translucent element blurs only the content directly behind it—giving the impression of looking through rice paper—it doesn't blur the rest of the screen.
