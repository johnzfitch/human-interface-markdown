#### The Apple or Command key  
The Apple key is labeled on different computers with an Apple symbol, a cloverleaf symbol, or both. It has also been known as the Command key or Open Apple key. Pressing a character key while holding down the Apple key usually tells the application to interpret the key as a command, not as a character. In some applications, the Apple key is used with other keys to provide special functions or shortcuts—for example, pressing Apple-Shift-3 on a Macintosh saves, on disk, a snapshot of the current screen.
