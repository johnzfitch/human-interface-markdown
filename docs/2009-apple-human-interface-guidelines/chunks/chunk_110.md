<span id="page-111-6"></span>Before performing an operation on an object, the user must select it to distinguish it from other objects. There is always immediate visual feedback to show that something is selected.  
Selecting an object never alters the object itself, and a selection is always undoable by clicking outside the selection.  
How something is selected depends on what it is. It's useful to distinguish among three types of objects that are each dealt with in a different way when selected:  
- **Text.** An application considers all text appearing together in a particular context as a block of text—a one-dimensional string of characters. A block of text can range from a single field, as in a dialog, to an entire document, as in a word processor. Regardless of where it appears, text is edited in the same way.
- **Arrays of fields**. A one-dimensional array of fields is a *list* and a two-dimensional array is a *table*. Each field contains information such as text or graphics.
- **Graphics.** For the purposes of this discussion, a graphic, or picture, is a discrete object that can be selected individually.  
<span id="page-111-1"></span>The following sections discuss the general methods of selecting and the specific methods that apply to text, arrays, and graphics.
