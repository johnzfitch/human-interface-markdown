A **palette** is a small container view that gives a user instant access to useful settings or information. For example, a user can use the Styles palette (from the Extras Drawer) to set the font, size, and style of any selected text or to change the line weight of a drawing. [Figure 2-23](#page-68-0) shows the Styles palette.  
A palette must be movable, so it has a rounded-corner matte border and a drag handle, like a slip. A palette can have a title, but typically a palette's contents make its function clear without a title.  
A palette floats on top of main views and on top of slips that are already open. For details on the customary position of a palette, the front-to-back order of container views, and how container views move, see ["How Views Work" on](#page-71-0)  [page 2-28](#page-71-0).

A palette has a Close box, or a large Close box if a text or picture button is adjacent, but the user may leave the palette open indefinitely. This has several ramifications, one being that a user must be able to move the palette to get at whatever it is covering. In addition, changes a user makes in a palette should take effect right away. Immediate feedback lets the user see that the input had the desired effect. If your application doesn't respond immediately to new settings of checkboxes, radio buttons, and other controls, it's less clear to the user when the input goes into effect. (For descriptions of close boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, and other controls, see [Chapter 3, "Controls."](#page-94-0))  
Palettes that remain open take up screen space, a valuable commodity on smaller screens. Therefore, use palettes sparingly. Don't use a palette where you can use a slip instead (such as in situations where the user can make the appropriate settings and then close the slip). Don't use a palette in place of controls in the status bar.
