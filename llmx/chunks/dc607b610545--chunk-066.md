During the design process, you may discover problems with your product design. You can use the 80 percent solution to help determine how to solve those problems. The 80 percent solution means that your design meets the needs of at least 80 percent of your users. If you try to design for the 20 percent of your target audience who are power users, your design will not be usable by the majority of your users. Even though those 20 percent are likely to have good ideas and probably think a lot like you, the majority of people may not be like the 20 percent who are elite users of your product. Involving a broad range of users in your design process will help you find the 80 percent solution.
