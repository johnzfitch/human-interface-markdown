As you lay out your webpage or iPhone web application, you often find that you need to display information in a list-like format. Lists are a natural way to present information organized by date, popularity, name, location, or any othersorting scheme. Lists are based on the principles ofsimplicity and ease of use (described in ["Simplicity](#page-20-1) and Ease of Use" (page 21)) and consistency (described in ["Consistency"](#page-27-0) (page 28)) and they are an especially effective way for iPhone web applications to display information. This is because lists encourage a simple, uncluttered layout and, because they are similar to menus, users already understand how they work. Thissection describestwo waysto lay out lists and providesthe metrics you need to organize your content so that it looks good on iPhone and is easy for users to read and use.  
For code examples showing how to implement these guidelines, see *iPhoneListPatterns*.  
One style of list layout, the edge-to-edge list layout, displays all items in equally sized rows. It is well suited to iPhone web applicationsthat need to display a large number of items,such aslocations, names, or objects, from which users can choose. When users choose an item from the list, an iPhone web application might respond by:  
- Displaying details about the item,such as contact information for the chosen person or theater information associated with the chosen concert.
- Performing an action associated with the item. For example, if the list displaysitemsforsale, the selection of an item might result in the display of an order form.
- Displaying another, more focused list of items that helps users drill down to the desired content. In this way, you can present a large amount of hierarchically organized information in a simple, efficient way. For example, an iPhone web application that helps users decide which books to buy might first display a list of literary genres, followed by a list of authors in each genre, followed by a list of book titles for each author.  
<span id="page-36-0"></span>Figure 4-9 shows an example of an edge-to-edge layout used to display a list of names. Note that the last names are displayed in bold font to make it clear that the list is alphabetized by last name (see ["Edge-to-Edge](#page-37-0) List [Metrics"](#page-37-0) (page 38) for details on the display of text in lists).

The otherstyle of list layout, the rounded rectangle list layout, displaysinformation in separate, rounded-corner boxes that are visually distinct from the background. This type of layout is useful for displaying small groups of information related to a single topic. To display a person's contact information, for example, you might list home, work, mobile, and fax numbers in one box, email addresses in another box, and street addresses in a third box. The "After" illustration in [Figure](#page-35-1) 4-8 (page 36) shows one way this can look.  
The rounded-rectangle design is well suited for use as the destination screen displayed at the end of some number of preceding edge-to-edge lists. For example, as described above, an iPhone web application that helps users find books can use edge-to-edge lists that allow users to make increasingly specific choices, drilling down through genres, authors, and book titles. To display details about a specific book, however, the application can use the rounded-rectangle layout to display groups of related information, such as the book's publication information, links to reviews, and titles of similar books.  
#### <span id="page-37-0"></span>Edge-to-Edge List Metrics  
To display a flat list of items, use the edge-to-edge design, which yields the most space for your content. Each row, or cell, is 44 pixels high (including the line at the bottom of the cell) and 320 pixels wide.  
Use Helvetica, 20-pixel size, in black for all text. By default, you should make your text bold for optimum readability, but you can use regular font for content that'slessimportant. You can also use bold to emphasize a portion of the text that's used for sorting. For example, if you display a list of full names alphabetized by last name, you can use bold font for the last name and regular font for the rest of the name. Text should be inset 10 pixels from the left edge and 14 pixels from the line at the bottom edge of the cell.  
The background fill color of the list is white, and the lines between items are R = 217, G = 217, B = 217.  
<span id="page-37-1"></span>If you need to provide a control, design a rounded rectangular button that is 29 pixels high and has a corner radius of 5 pixels but that has a target area that is 44 pixels high. Use Helvetica, 12-pixel size, for the label on the button. Place the button 10 pixels from the right edge of a cell and center it vertically. Figure 4-10 shows this style of layout (without a button).

320 pixels  
#### <span id="page-38-0"></span>Rounded-Rectangle List Metrics  
To display items in groups, use the rounded-rectangle design. Each rounded rectangle has a corner radius of 8 pixels, a width of 300 pixels, and white background fill. The edges of the rounded rectangles and the horizontal lines between the cells inside them are R = 217, G = 217, B = 217.  
Because there is slightly less space for content in this design, use Helvetica, 17-pixel size, in black for all text. As with the edge-to-edge design, you should use bold font by default, but you can use regular font for secondary or de-emphasized text. Within a rounded rectangle, text should be inset 10 pixels from the left edge and 14 pixels from the bottom edge of a cell.  
<span id="page-38-1"></span>A rounded rectangle should be inset 10 pixels from both right and left edges of the iPhone screen and 17 pixels from the top of the button bar. Figure 4-11 shows the layout of this design.

**Figure 4-11** Rounded-rectangle list design layout  
The design shown in Figure 4-11 allows you to display text between the rounded rectangles that you can use aslabelsfor the groups of content. Thistextshould be Helvetica, 17-pixelsize, and should be bold. Instead of black, however, the color of this text is R = 76, G = 86, B = 108. The size of the area behind the rounded rectangles is 320 pixels wide and 356 pixels high and its background fill color is R = 197, G = 204, B = 211.
