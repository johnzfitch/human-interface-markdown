#### Windows

Since the focus of attention is on the content region of the window, color should be used only in that area. Using color in the scroll bars or title bar can simply distract the user. (The one exception to this is that if the user has color-coded icons in the Finder, the title of a window—not the whole title bar—may be the same color as the icon from which it came.)
