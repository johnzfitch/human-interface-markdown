# Controls, Dialogs, and Alerts

The "select-then-choose" paradigm is good enough whenever operations are simple and act on only one object. For those times when a command requires more than one object or needs additional infOImation before it can be executed, the Apple human interface provides two additional features:

- Dialogs, to allow the user to provide the needed additional information before a command is executed
- Alerts, to notify the user whenever an unusual situation occurs

Because both of these features lean heavily on controls, controls are described in this section, even though controls are also used in other places.
