Always try to use tab views to indicate multiple changeable panes, as shown in the previous sections. However, if you have too many tabs to fit into a window properly you should instead use a pop-up menu to change the contents of a group box (see [Figure 15-24](#page-302-0) (page 303).  
As with tabs, the pop-up menu should be centered on the top of the group box.
