Newton isn't designed for complex tasks or applications that require viewing a large area or multiple windows of data at a time. Applications that require the user to keep track of several pieces of information at once probably won't work well because the user must either move around a lot within the application, or deal with many simultaneous or layered views. Studies show that users become confused in those situations.  
Remember that people will use Newton while on the move, in places where there's no place to sit or to set it down. In such settings, it's easiest to use applications with simple, straightforward screens and an obvious path through the information. Make sure that your application's controls are clearly identified, that there aren't too many "places" for the user to navigate through, that you don't display too many container views at once, and that the user can easily see what to do. Minimize writing; tapping to pick from a list of alternatives is easier.
