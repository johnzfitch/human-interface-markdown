The features and capabilities that make Newton what it is also strongly influence what people want to do with Newton devices. These expectations indirectly affect the user interface of Newton software. An application must make it easy for people to accomplish the following tasks on demand:  
- Capture information fragments—write, sketch, pick from lists, specify dates and times, and select options
- Organize information—file, sort, schedule, prioritize, copy, delete, and format
- Retrieve information—find, recall, browse, skim, read, and view
- Send and in some cases receive information by various means—print, fax, mail, and direct transfer
