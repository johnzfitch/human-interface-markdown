Every document and application window and panel should have, at a minimum:  
- A title bar. Even if a window does not have an actual title (a tools panel, for example), it should have a title bar so that users can move the window.
- A close button, so that users have a consistent way to dismiss the window.  
<span id="page-193-2"></span>A standard document window may also have the following additional elements that an application window or panel might not have:  
- Horizontal or vertical scroll bars, or both (if not all the window's contents are visible)
- Minimize and zoom buttons
- A proxy icon (after a document has been saved)
- The title of the document
- A resize control
- A toolbar control (if the window contains a toolbar)  
Figure 14-4 shows most of these elements in their proper placements in a document window (to see the proper placement of a horizontal scroll bar, see [Figure](#page-225-0) 14-37 (page 226)).

Windows can also display a bottom bar, which is a portion of the window frame that extends below the main content area of the window body. A bottom bar contains controls that directly affect the contents and organization of the window. Controls in a bottom bar are important, but less so than controls in a toolbar. Figure 14-5 shows the bottom bar in an iCal window.

Another optional window element is the scope bar. A scope bar appears below an application's toolbar and allows users to narrow down a search operation or to filter objects or other operations by identifying specific sets of characteristics. Figure 14-6 shows the scope bar in the Finder.
