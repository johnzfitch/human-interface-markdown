#### Line spacing  
Most Roman fonts for the Macintosh have space above all the letters to allow for diacritical marks as with Ä or Ñ. If text is drawn using a standard font immediately below a dark line, for example, it will appear to be separated from the line by at least one row of blank pixels (for all but a few exceptional characters). Pixels in some non-Roman fonts, on the other hand, can extend to the top of the character, and appear to merge with the preceding line. To avoid character display overlap, applications should leave blank space around text (as in dialog editText items) or add space before the first line of text and after the last line of text, as well as between lines of text.
