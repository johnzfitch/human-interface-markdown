<!-- Chunk 5 | Source: 1986-07 Human Interface Guidelines (Second Beta Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 307 -->
This section outlines the principles behind the Apple human interface—the *spirit* of the interface.

For example, computers will always provide views of information, but not necessarily by means of "windows."
