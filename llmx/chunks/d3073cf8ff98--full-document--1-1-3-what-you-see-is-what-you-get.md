## 1.1.3 What you see is what you get

Lisa applications try to match the appearance of the document on the screen to the way the document would look if it were printed. This principle is called visual fidelity, or "what you see is what you get" (wys/wyg). Of course, the different properties of the two media make it impossible to match exactly, but it is very helpful to users to match as closely as possible. For example, fonts are designed to look as similar as possible on the screen and on paper. Other features such as column width in tables, margins in LisaWrite, and shadings in LisaOraw are kept the same when the document is printed as when it is displayed on the screen. The goal is to make it unnecessary for the user to go through a separate formatting stage when she wants to print a document.
