An **image well** is a drag-and-drop target for an icon or image.  
**API Note:** To define an image well in your code, use the NSImageView class.  
For example, the Password pane in Accounts preferences uses an image well to allow users to choose a picture to represent them.

Some image wells,such asthe user picture in the Password pane of Accounts preferences, must always contain an image. If you allow users to clear an image well (that is, leave it empty), be sure to provide standard Edit menu commands and Clipboard support for the contents of the image well.
