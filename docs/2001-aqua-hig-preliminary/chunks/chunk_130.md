The main object in your application icon should represent the media the application creates or views, and should maintain the familiar diamond-like rotation. Generally, Mac OS X user application icons are designed to appear as if they're sitting on a desk in front of you. This perspective (looking down at a layered set of elements), combined with the superior aesthetic capabilities of Mac OS X, help the

user perceive icons as familiar objects. This familiarity helps the application become more approachable and non-threatening to novice users and enables you to design icons with the desired emotive quality. You can make an icon as fun or as serious as appropriate. [Figure 10-3](#page-157-2) shows an example of a user application icon that clearly communicates its purpose in a way that invites the user to learn more about it.

Observe the use of color, curve, and shading in [Figure 10-3.](#page-157-2) Alpha channels allow for complex, soft shadows that emphasize the effect of layered elements as well as perspective. Alpha channels can also be used for transparency, so you can provide the effect of translucency, as seen in [Figure 10-4](#page-157-3). 32-bit color provides a vibrant color palette.

<span id="page-158-4"></span>When possible and appropriate, an icon should also include a tool element that communicates the type of task the application allows the user to accomplish. The magnifying glass in [Figure 10-4](#page-157-3) is a good example of a supportive tool element. The tool should closely relate to the base object that it rests upon; typically the tool is rotated in an opposite direction. Ideally, the user application icon should tell a story of how the application can be used. More examples of the supporting tool concept are shown in [Figure 10-5](#page-158-3).

In contrast to the "object on a desktop" approach discussed in ["User Application](#page-156-5)  [Icons" \(page 157\)](#page-156-5), utility application icons are designed to reinforce the typically serious nature of utility applications. This change in style shifts the visual perspective to that of an object on a shelf at eye level, directly in front of the user. Unlike richly colored user application icons, utility icons are generally grayscale, with color applied sparingly. [Figure 10-6](#page-159-5) shows an example of a utility icon.

<span id="page-159-6"></span>Since utility applications are normally focused on a narrow set of tasks, it's best to keep the number of elements in the icon to a minimum. The supporting tool should be the main focus or an integrated element, as opposed to a layered object.
