#### **Beeps**  
Beeps are used for errors that are both minor and immediately obvious. For example, if the user tries to backspace past the left boundary of a text field, the application can simply beep instead of displaying an alert box. So that people who can't hear don't miss the message, all beeps should be accompanied by a flash (rapid inverting) of the menu bar.
