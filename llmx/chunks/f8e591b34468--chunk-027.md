<!-- Chunk 27 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 149 -->
Everything the program expects the user to do is either familiar or feels intuitively right. The user should feel comfortable within the program and the program should be supportive, responding to the user's best guess of the right thing to do at any one moment. Everything in this document really leads toward an intuitively correct program. But matters of intuition cannot be thoroughly dissected: the ultimate test lies with whether a new user can feel master of the program within a very short time, or whether he will simply flounder around, trying to figure out what the program wants and why.
