# Visual Thinking

![](images/_page_372_Picture_14.jpeg)

Adams, J. L. *Conceptual Blockbusting*, second edition. New York: Norton, 1979.

Hanks, Kurt, and Jerry Belliston. *Rapid Viz: A New Method for the Rapid Visualization of Ideas.* Los Altos, CA: William Kaufmann, 1980.

Presents drawing as a way of capturing ideas quickly and casually, not as a means of producing a finished illustration. The book shows how simple techniques such as contour drawing can make drawing a more useful tool for anyone.

McKim, Robert H. *Experiences in Visual Thinking,* second edition. Boston: PWS, 1980.

Discusses thinking and introduces drawing as a means of strengthening the thinking process. The book weaves together research findings, citations for further reading, quotations, mental exercises, and drawing techniques.
