## **Implementing the Info Panel**

![](images/_page_107_Picture_1.jpeg)

Each application must have an Info panel. This ordinary panel should display a small amount of basic information about the application:

- The name of the application
- The application icon
- Copyright information
- The current version of the application
- The names of the authors (optional)

The Info panel should not offer help for using the application or give an extensive amount of other information about it (such as its history or purpose).

Interface Builder provides a sample Info panel that you can use in your application. See "The Info Menu" in Chapter 6 for information on the command that brings up the Info panel.
