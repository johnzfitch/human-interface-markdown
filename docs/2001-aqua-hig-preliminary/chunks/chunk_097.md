A **group box** is used to associate a set of related items—such as radio buttons or pop-up menus—in a dialog.  
As much as possible, *use additional space between controls to create groups of controls, rather than group boxes.* Excessive use of group boxes creates visual clutter; too many lines and edges can distract users. The following figures show examples of how to successfully re-create dialogs using space rather than group boxes.  
Within a group box, no control or label should be positioned within 16 pixels of the box's top, bottom, left, or right borders.  
Group boxes can be untitled or titled. Titles can be static text, a checkbox label, or text on a pop-up menu.
