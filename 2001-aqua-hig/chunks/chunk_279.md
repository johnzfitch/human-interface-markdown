- Do the standard window size and position take into account the dimensions of the screen?
- Is the standard state of a window best suited to working on the document (such as no wider than the page width), and not necessarily as large as the full screen?
- Does your application sensibly open new windows in either the standard or the user state?
- Can each resizable window be made as large as the smaller of either the maximum document size or the maximum size of the displays, including multiple monitor displays?
- Is the default position of a window contained on a single screen?
- Is each additional window opened below and to the right of its predecessor?
- If a user drags a window from one monitor to another monitor, does your application open subsequent windows on the second monitor?
- Do you use the lowercase letters "untitled," without additional punctuation, in a new window title? Do you add a number to the second and subsequent new windows, but not to the first? Do you avoid using blank titles?
- Do document titles display or hide filename extensions appropriately?
