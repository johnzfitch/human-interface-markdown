Your App Store description is a great opportunity to communicate with potential users. In addition to describing your application accurately and highlighting the qualities you think people might appreciate the most, follow these guidelines:  
**Be sure to correct all spelling, grammatical, and punctuation errors**. Although such errors don't bother everyone, in some people they can create a negative impression of your application's quality.  
**Keep all-capital words to a minimum**. The occasional all-capital word can draw people's attention, but capitalizing every letter of every word in a description can make it very difficult to read.  
**Consider describing specific bug fixes**. If a new version of your application contains bug fixesthat customers have been waiting for, it can be a good idea to mention this in your description.
