There are several conventionsforselecting graphic objects. Thissection describestwo waysto show selection feedback; other situations may require other solutions.  
An object-based graphics document is a collection of individual graphic objects. To select an object, the user clicks it once. The object is then bracketed with handles, which the user can use to move or resize the object.  
In object-based graphics documents, users can select with the mouse alone or a combination of the mouse and the keyboard. A user can drag a dotted rectangle and select every object that is included, even partially, within the rectangle's outline. The user can also select an initial object and then use Shift-click or Command-click to select other objects. If the objects have a defined order, Shift-click should result in a continuousselection and Command-click should provide a discontinuousselection. If the order is not defined, then both actions result in a discontinuous selection. Examples of continuous and discontinuous selections are shown in ["Selection](#page-111-1) Methods" (page 112)
