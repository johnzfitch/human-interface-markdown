Dreyfuss, Henry. *Symbol Sourcebook: An Authoritative Guide to International Graphic Symbols.* New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1984.  
Presents thousands of symbols, presented first by subject, then by shape, and finally in the index by name. This book provides a fertile source for the designer seeking icons or other stylized design images.

Holmes, Nigel, with Rose DeNeve. *Designing Pictorial Symbols.* New York: Watson-Guptil, 1985.  
Presents 54 case studies of how concepts were transformed into icons. This book is useful because it not only shows the finished icon but also explains the stages and thoughts that the designer went through to create each icon.
