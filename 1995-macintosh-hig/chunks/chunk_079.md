For the third step, apply the information you've collected about your users, their skills, and the tasks you envision them performing to create a prototype of your design. Prototyping is the process by which you develop preliminary versions of your design to verify its workability. You can use a variety of techniques to construct prototypes of your design. Creating storyboards is one technique—you draw out the steps your users will go through to accomplish a task using your product. Another technique is to build a simulation of the product in prototyping software that animates some features or demonstrates how the product will work.
