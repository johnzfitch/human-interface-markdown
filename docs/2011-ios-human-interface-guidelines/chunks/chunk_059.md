**Avoid including settings in your application if you can**. Settings include preferred application behaviors and information that people rarely want to change. Users cannot open the Settings application without first quitting your application, and you don't want to encourage this action.  
When you design your application to function the way most of your users expect, you decrease the need for settings. If you need information about the user, query the system for it instead of asking users to provide it. If you decide you must provide settingsin your iOS application,see "The Settings Bundle" in *iOS Application Programming Guide* to learn how to support them in your code.  
**Let users set the behavior they want by using configuration options in your application**. Configuration optionslet your application react dynamically to changes, because people do not have to leave your application to set them.  
**Offer configuration options in the main userinterface or(in iPhone apps) on the back of a view**. To decide which location makes sense, determine whether the options represent a primary task and how often people might want to set them.  
- In the main UI, put options that provide primary functionality or that people want to change frequently.
- For example, iPad Calendar allows people to view their schedules by day, week, or month. These configuration options are offered in the main UI because viewing different perspectives of a calendar is a primary functionality of the app and people are likely to change their focus frequently.
- Apps that provide an immersive experience, such as games, are most likely to provide configuration options within the app, because users tend to change aspects of the experience frequently.
- In iPhone apps, you can put options that people are unlikely to change frequently on the back of a view. For example, the primary function of Weather is to display a city's current conditions and 6-day forecast. Although it'simportant to be able to choose whether temperatures are displayed in Celsius or Fahrenheit, people are not likely to change this option very often. Therefore it makes sense to put the temperature-scale option on the back of the Weather view, where it is conveniently available, but not obtrusive.
