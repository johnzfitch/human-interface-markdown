A **toolbar** gives users convenient access to the most frequently used commands and features in an app. For example, the default Mail toolbar includes the commands people use most often as they view, compose, and manage their email.

Users often rely on the presence of a toolbar, but you can hide it in a full-screen window if users don't need it to accomplish the focused task. For example, Preview hides the toolbar in a full-screen window because users are more likely to be focused on reading content than on annotating it. If you hide the toolbar in a full-screen window, users should be able to reveal it (along with the menu bar) when they move the pointer to the top of the screen.  
Because a toolbar in an app or document window contains frequently used items, it tends to be a prominent part of the user's experience with your app. The guidelines in this section help you to design a toolbar that enhances the usability of your app.  
**Note:** Other types of windows, such as panels and preferences windows, can also contain toolbars. In general, the style and usage of toolbars in these types of windows differ from the style and usage of a toolbar in an app or document window. To learn how to design a panel, see ["Panels"](#page-208-0) (page 209); to learn how to design a preferences window, see ["Preferences](#page-219-0) Windows" (page 220).  
**Create toolbar items that represent the functionality users need most often.** To help you decide which items to include in your toolbar, consider the user's mental model of the task they perform in your app (to learn more about the mental model, see ["Mental](#page-26-2) Model" (page 27)).  
**Arrange toolbar items so that they support the main task users accomplish in your app.** In general, you want to use the left end of the toolbar for commands that should have the highest visibility. (In a localized version of your app, the commands that you've identified as being high-visibility might appear in the right end of the toolbar.) "High visibility" can mean different things in different apps. In some apps, for example, frequency of use should determine visibility; in other apps, it makes more sense to rank items according to importance, significance, or their place in an object hierarchy. The figure below illustrates three possible ways to arrange toolbar items.

#### **If appropriate, separate toolbar items into subsets and then arrange the subsets according to importance.**  
Sometimes, you can define logical subsets of your app's features and objects, such as one subset of document-manipulation commands and another subset of commands for manipulating page-level objects such as paragraphs, lists, and tables. When this is the case, you can arrange the items in each subset according to importance or frequency of use, and then use the same criteria to position each subset in the toolbar.  
The default Keynote toolbar is an example of this type of arrangement. Keynote groups items according to functionality and then positions the groups so that the items that handle slide decks and slides are to the left of items that provide inspection and selection of object attributes. You can see about half of these groups below:

**Don't use standard Aqua controls in a toolbar.** Standard Aqua controls look bad on the toolbar background. Instead, you should use the controls that have been specifically designed for use in toolbars, such as the round textured button (shown here used for the Quick Look button in the Finder toolbar). To learn more about the controls you can use in a toolbar, see ["Window-Frame](#page-240-0) Controls" (page 241).  
![](images/_page_181_Picture_6.jpeg)  
**Important:** Don't use the toolbar-specific controls anywhere else in your window. The toolbar controls include a translucency that makes them look good on the toolbar background; but on a window-body background, these controls can disappear or look inactive.  
**Ensure that your toolbar controls clearly communicate their meaning to users.** It's best when users can tell what a toolbar control does without experimentation (or waiting to see a help tag). You can use system-provided icons in your toolbar controls to represent a wide range of common commands and features, such as the  
Action menu and Quick Look; that is, and . Users are familiar with the meanings of these items, and using them frees you from having to design custom icons. (For more information about the system-provided images you can use, see ["System-Provided](#page-319-0) Icons" (page 320).)  
**Important:** If you use system-provided images in your toolbar controls, be sure to use them according to their documented meanings. For example, use the Action gear symbol in an Action menu only; don't use it to represent "build" or "advanced."  
**If necessary, you can design custom icons to represent toolbar items.** If you have to do this, be sure to follow the guidelines in ["Designing](#page-121-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 122).  
**Avoid displaying a persistent selected appearance for a toolbar item.** When the user clicks an item in an app or document window toolbar the item highlights briefly, and an immediate action occurs,such as opening a new window, switching to a different view, displaying a menu, or inserting (or removing) an object. Because the result of the click is an action, it does not make sense to imply that there is a change in state. The exception to this is a segmented control that shows a persistent selected appearance within the context of the control, such as the view controls in the Finder toolbar:  
![](images/_page_182_Picture_2.jpeg)  
**Make every toolbar item available as a menu command.** Because users can customize the toolbar (and it can be hidden under some circumstances), the toolbar should not be the only place to find a command.  
It's important to emphasize that the converse of this guideline is *not* true. That is, you should not create a toolbar item for every menu command, because not all commands are important enough (or used frequently enough) to warrant inclusion in a toolbar.  
**In general, allow users to show or hide the toolbar.** Users might want to hide the toolbar to minimize distractions or reveal more of their content. (Note that you can cause the toolbar to hide automatically in a full-screen window.) The commands for showing and hiding the toolbar belong in the View menu (for more information about this menu, see "The View [Menu"](#page-157-0) (page 158)).  
**In general, allow users to customize the toolbar.** Although the default toolbar should include the commands that most users want, you should allow users to customize this set of commands to support their individual working styles. In addition, users should be able to specify whether toolbar items are displayed as controls only, text only, or controls with text (by default, display both controls and text). Place the Customize Toolbar command in the View menu (for more information about this menu,see "The View [Menu"](#page-157-0) (page 158)). Although you can also allow usersto adjust the size of toolbar items, most users don't expect this capability (if you decide to do this, you must supply different sizes of toolbar icons).  
In addition, you can enable a contextual menu that is revealed when users Control-click the toolbar itself. In this menu, users can choose to customize the appearance and contents of the toolbar in various ways.  
**Avoid putting an app-specific contextual menu in your toolbar.** Users reveal the contextual toolbar customization menu by Control-clicking anywhere in the toolbar. Additionally, in document windows, users can reveal the document path menu by Control-clicking the window title. This does not leave any areas in the toolbar that users could Control-click to reveal a third contextual menu. If you need to offer a set of commands that act upon an object the user selects, use an Action menu control instead (this item is described in ["Action](#page-262-0) [Menu"](#page-262-0) (page 263)).  
**Enable click-through for toolbar items when appropriate.** Click-through means that the user can activate the item when the containing window is inactive. You can support click-through for any subset of toolbar items. In general, you want to allow click-through for nondestructive actions that users might want to perform when they're focused on a task in a different window. For additional guidelines on supporting click-through, see "Enabling [Click-Through"](#page-201-1) (page 202).
