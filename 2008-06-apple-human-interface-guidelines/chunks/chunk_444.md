Column views do not display disclosure triangles. The triangle displayed to the right of an item is merely an indicator that means the item contains other objects (to reveal those objects, users click anywhere on the item's row).  
Columns in column views do not have headings, because a column view does not behave like a table. A column in a column view contains the objects that exist at a particular node in the hierarchy, it does not contain an attribute of every object in the hierarchy.  
Although a column view does not require a label, it can be helpful to display the current position in the hierarchy in a way that's easy for users to see at a glance. The Finder does this by using the name of the parent object as the title of the window. For example, in [Figure](#page-325-0) 15-81 (page 326), the title of the window (Java) is the name of the currently selected item's parent.  
Column views can contain icons in addition to text. Usually, however, the icons in a column view are an integral part of the data items (such as the folder and application icons shown in [Figure](#page-325-0) 15-81 (page 326)).
