**bitmap-based graphics application** A graphics application that creates images by turning on individual pixels on the screen. Each graphic is a collection of pixels.

**button** An image, often resembling a push button, in dialog boxes that the user clicks to designate, confirm, or cancel an action. Compare **mouse button, radio button.**

**context sensitive** Able to perceive the situation in which an event occurs. For example, if an application program presents help information specific to the particular task the user is performing, rather than a general list of commands, that help is said to be context sensitive.

**control** An object in a window on the Macintosh screen with which the user, by using the mouse, can cause instant action with visible results or change settings to modify a future action. The control is internally represented in a control record.

**control panel** A utility that lets the user change global features such as the speaker volume, the keyboard repeat speed and delay, mouse tracking, and number of colors displayed.
