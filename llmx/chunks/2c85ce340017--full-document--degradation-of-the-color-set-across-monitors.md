#### Degradation of the Color Set Across Monitors

If the default color table colors aren't available, the system software gracefully degrades to black and white. First the operating system tries to match 8-bit colors. If it can't successfully match the colors you specify with those in the system palette, then it displays the 4-bit icon that you supply. If the operating system can't find or match the 4-bit colors, then it displays the icon in black and white. The system software won't substitute colors that aren't visually close to colors that you assigned. If you choose colors other than the 34 marked in Figure 8-23, use them for detail and not for essential parts of your windows or icons.
