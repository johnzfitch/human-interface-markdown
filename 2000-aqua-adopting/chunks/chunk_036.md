The Application menu, which is new in Mac OS X, replaces the Apple menu from previous versions of Mac OS. This menu is populated with menu items that are general to the application; that is, items that are not specific to a document or other window.

The title of the application menu is the name of the application. In [Figure 1-28](#page-33-0), for example, the menu title is "Mail." The limited space available for this name requires that you provide a short application name (16 characters or less) as part of the application package. You should ensure that your title does not exceed 128 pixels in width when drawn in the standard menu font. Note that the About item, the Hide command, and the Quit command should all use this short application name, as well.  
**Note:** The user can use the System Preferences application to specify whether the application menu displays the application name or its icon.  
The first item below the application menu title is the familiar About item. It provides access to the application's About dialog and should be named appropriately. For example, the Mail application's About item is About Mail. Any menu items that provide access to the application's preference dialogs should be installed below the About item. You should include any other application-specific items here, as well. If you specify a single "About" item and a single preference item, do not use a menu separator between them. If you include a number of application-specific items, you can use a menu separator to group them.  
The Services menu, currently available only for Cocoa applications, is the next item in the application menu. This item is preceded by a menu separator. The Hide command, found in the process menu on Mac OS 9, is the next item in a Mac OS X  
application menu. This command is preceded by a menu separator and followed by the Hide Others and Show All commands. The last menu item of the application menu is the Quit command. This menu item has been moved from its previous location, the File menu. Quit should be preceded by a menu separator.
