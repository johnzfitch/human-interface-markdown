#### Groups of Checkboxes or Radio Buttons

You can provide a single balloon for an entire group of radio buttons, or for a group of closely related checkboxes. When providing one balloon for a group of options, describe what you can do with the options, how to implement the options, and how you can tell whether an option is selected.
