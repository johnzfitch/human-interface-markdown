An application's main view should have an ordinary, underlined title at the top unless the view's identity is obvious from its contents. An application's main view cannot have an ordinary title at the top if the application allows users to file information in folders. In this case a **folder tab** must go at the top of the main view. A folder tab shows the name of the folder whose data is currently displayed in the view, and a user can choose a different folder by tapping the folder tab. A folder tab can include a view title or a digital clock and calendar, but does not have to include either of them. (For more information on folders and folder tabs, see [Chapter 8, "Newton Services."](#page-242-0)) Figure 2-9 compares a main view with a title to another main view with a folder tab.
