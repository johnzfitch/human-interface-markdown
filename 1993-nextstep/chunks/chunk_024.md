The great advantage of a graphical user interface is that it can feel natural to the user. The screen becomes a visual metaphor for the real world, and the objects it displays can be manipulated in ways that reflect the ways familiar objects in the real world are manipulated.  
This is what's meant when a user interface is said to be "intuitive"-it behaves as we expect based on our experience with real objects in the real world.  
The similarity of graphical to real objects is at a fundamental rather than a superficial level. Graphical objects don't need to resemble physical objects in every detail. But they do need to behave in ways that our experience with real objects would lead us to expect.  
For example, objects in the real world stay where we put them; they don't disappear and reappear again, unless someone causes them to do so. The user should expect no less from graphical objects. Similarly, although a graphical dial or switch doesn't have to duplicate all the attributes of a real dial or switch, it should be immediately recognizable by the user and should be used for the sorts of operations that real dials and switches are used for.  
Each application should try to maximize the intuitiveness of its user interface. Its choice of graphical objects should be appropriate to the tasks at hand, and users should feel at home with the operations they're asked to perform. The more natural and intuitive the user interface, the more successful an application can be.
