When there is a dialog box on the screen, you can add the following wording to the end of each balloon that refers to an unavailable item:  
"Not available because a modal dialog box is on the screen."  
#### Icons 11  
Apple provides standard balloons for icons. If you wish, you can provide your own balloons for your application and its associated special files, but don't provide balloons for your application's document icons.  
You don't need to describe how to open icons; you can assume that Macintosh users know how. Figure 11-16 shows the standard help balloons for an application icon and a document icon.

#### <span id="page-348-0"></span>Text Entry Boxes 11  
When you describe text entry boxes in dialog boxes, use *here* to describe the area. You don't have to name the area, or describe standard Macintosh editing procedures. Figure 11-17 shows an example of a help balloon for a text entry box.
