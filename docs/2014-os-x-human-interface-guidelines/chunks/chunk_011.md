Users want an app that acts upon their commands and tells them how long the process will take. If your app doesn't do a good job of giving feedback to users, they may think that your app is unresponsive or difficult to use.

**Instantly acknowledge the user's commands and input.** Users expect to receive some type of feedback every time they interact with your app. In OS X, buttons respond visually when users click them, and the pointer changes appropriately as users move it over different controls and areas. Similarly, if a command can't be carried out, users want to know why it can't and what they can do instead. The quicker you provide feedback for the user'sinteractions, the more responsive your app appears. To learn more about the principle of feedback, see Feedback and [Communication](#page-63-0) (page 64).  
**Note:** Animation can be a great way to show users what they can do and how their actions can affect onscreen items. To learn more about using animation, see [Animation](#page-35-0) (page 36).  
**Don't wait until a long task completes before you display any results to users.** If you display nothing until you have all the results, users might interpret this as sluggishness. Instead, display partial results as soon as possible after users initiate a long task so that they have something useful to view while the rest of the task completes.  
**Use an indicator to help users gauge how long a process will take to complete.** Users don't always need to know precisely how long a task will take, but it's important to give them an estimate. For example, the Finder combines a progress indicator with optional explanatory text to show users about how long a copy operation will take.  
**Warn users when they initiate a task that can cause an unexpected and irreversible loss of data.** Such warnings are important, but they can become annoying—and users tend to ignore them—if they appear too often. Make sure you don't warn users when data loss is an expected outcome of an action. For example, the Finder doesn't display an alert when the user throws away a file because the user intends to delete the file. For more guidelines on how to use alerts in your app, see [Alerts](#page-171-0) (page 172).  
**Note:** If your app consists of a foreground processthat displays UI and a faceless background process that performs some or all of the app's main tasks, be sure to conduct all communication with the user through the UI of the foreground process. In particular, a background process should never display a dialog or window that asks the user to change settings or supply information, because the user may not know (or remember) that the background process is running and receiving communication from it would be confusing. If a background process must communicate with the user, it should start or bring forward the foreground app.
