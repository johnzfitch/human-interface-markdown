A control panel may generate some sort of screen representation that persists even when the control panel itself is closed. Such screen representations should always include a mechanism for opening the control panel. For example, if a control panel has an associated control strip module, that module should include a command that opens the control panel. [Figure 6-15](#page-125-0) shows control panel access from a control strip module.
