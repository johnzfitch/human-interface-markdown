The **Window menu** contains commands for organizingand managingan application'swindows. The menu should list an application's open document windows (including minimized windows) in the order in which they were opened, with the most recently opened document first. If a document contains unsaved changes, a bullet should appear next to its name.  
<span id="page-170-3"></span>Other than Minimize and Zoom (discussed below), the Window menu does not contain commands that affect the way a user views a window's contents. The View menu (described in "The [View](#page-168-0) [Menu"](#page-168-0) (page 169)) contains all commands that adjust how a user views a window's contents.

Mac OS X does not automaticallyadd utilitywindows to the list in the Window menu and you should not list individual utility windows in this menu. You can, however, add a command to the Window menu to show or hide utility windows in your application. (For more information about utility windows, see "Utility [Windows"](#page-201-0) (page 202).)  
The Minimize and Zoom commands are in the Window menu so that people using full keyboard access can implement these functions with the keyboard. Even if your application consists of only one window, include a Window menu for the Minimize and Zoom commands.  
Window menu items should appearin this order: Minimize,Zoom, separator, application-specific window commands, separator, Bring All to Front (optional), separator, list of open documents. Note that the Close command should appear in the File menu, below the Open command (see ["The](#page-162-0) File [Menu"](#page-162-0) (page 163)).  
**Carbon:** The Window menu is part of the default menu barwhen you create a Carbon application in Interface Builder. To create one programmatically, use the function CreateStandardWindowMenu. **Cocoa:** The Window menu is part of the default menu bar when you create a Cocoa application in Interface Builder.  
<span id="page-171-5"></span><span id="page-171-4"></span>**Minimize (Command-M).** Minimizes the active window to the Dock.  
<span id="page-171-6"></span>**Minimize All (Command-Option-M).** Minimizes all the windows of the active application to the Dock.  
<span id="page-171-3"></span>**Zoom.** Toggles between a predefined size appropriate to the window's content and the window size the user has set. This command should *not* expand thewindowto the full screen size. See ["Resizing](#page-194-0) and Zooming [Windows](#page-194-0) " (page 195).  
**Bring All to Front.** Brings forward all of an application's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order. This should happen whenever a user clicks the application icon in the Dock. See "Window [Layering"](#page-195-1) (page 196).  
<span id="page-171-2"></span>You can make this command an Option-enabled toggle with Arrange in Front.  
<span id="page-171-0"></span>**Arrange in Front.** Brings forward all of the application's windows in their current layering order and changes their location and size so they are neatly tiled.
