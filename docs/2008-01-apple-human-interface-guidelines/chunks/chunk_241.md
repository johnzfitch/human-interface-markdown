The rectangular-style toolbar control can be used in both the toolbar and the bottom bar. (The capsule-style toolbar control, described in ["Capsule-Style](#page-264-0) Toolbar Controls" (page 265), should be used in toolbars only.) The rectangular-style toolbar control is a very versatile control that can behave as a push button, a toggle button, a segmented control, or a pop-up menu. Figure 15-1 shows some variations of the rectangular-style toolbar control in Address Book.

#### Rectangular-Style Toolbar Control Usage  
In a toolbar, use rectangular-style toolbar controls to give users access to frequently used commands and objects (for guidelines on designing the contents of a toolbar, see ["Designing](#page-204-1) a Toolbar" (page 205)).For example, theFinder uses a combination of rectangular-style toolbar buttons and segmented controls to allow users to preview an item with Quick Look, choose a view style, see the path of an item's location, navigate through previously viewed items, and perform an action on an item. Figure 15-2 shows the rectangular toolbar buttons and segmented controls the Finder uses.

In a bottom bar, use rectangular-style toolbar controlswhen you need to provide controls that directly affect the contents or organization of the window body. In general, controls in the bottom bar are important, but theyare less frequently used than controls in the toolbar(see ["Bottom](#page-213-0) Bars" (page 214) for guidelines on designing the contents of a bottom bar). For example, the rectangular-style toolbar controls in the iCal bottom bar include a segmented control that allows users to add calendars and change the items displayed in the source list, and a button that shows or hides the to-do list, as shown in Figure 15-3.

#### Rectangular-Style Toolbar Control Contents and Labeling  
A rectangular-style toolbar button can contain either text or icons. In addition, this button can contain a downward-pointingarrowthat indicates the presence of a pop-up menu. A rectangular-style toolbar segmented control can also contain either text or icons, but should not contain a mix of text and icons.  
If you display an icon in a rectangular toolbar control, be sure the meaning of the image is clear and unambiguous (see ["Cultural](#page-49-1) Values" (page 50) for some advice on choosing appropriate imagery). In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, Interface Builder makes it easy to add to a control one of the system-provided images, such as the plus sign, the accounts symbol, or the locked symbol. You can see some of these symbols in the controls in the Finder toolbar, shown in [Figure](#page-261-0) 15-2 (page 262). See ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155) for more information on standard images available in Mac OS X v10.5 and later. If you need to design your own image, see "Designing Icons for [Rectangular-Style](#page-153-2) Toolbar [Controls"](#page-153-2) (page 154) for some metrics and guidelines.  
If you want to display text in a rectangular-style toolbar control, be sure it is either a noun (or noun phrase) that describes an object, setting, or state, or that it is a verb (or verb phrase) that describes an action. For example, the nouns used in the iCal toolbar controls clearly indicate the function of the controls. Text in rectangular-style toolbar controls should have title-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-135-0) of Interface Element Labels and Text" (page 136) for more on this style).  
If you use a rectangular-style toolbar control that behaves like a checkbox or a toggle button in a toolbar or bottom bar, you may be able to benefit from the automatic highlighting that signifies the on state of the button. If you do this, however, be very sure the control clearly indicates the correct state in the correct situation. Also, if you put such a control in a toolbar, you should provide two descriptive labels that can be displayed belowthe control. One label should describe the on (or pressed) state and one should describe the off (or unpressed) state. Finally, be sure to describe both of the states in the control's help tag, whether the control appears in a toolbar or a bottom bar. To learn more about the on-state appearance, see ["Rectangular-Style](#page-264-1) Toolbar Control Implementation" (page 265).  
For example, iCal offers toggle controls in its bottom bar that allow users to show or hide various views. When one of these views is visible, the associated toggle control is highlighted; when the view is hidden, the highlighting disappears. Figure 15-4 shows the iCal bottom bar, along with a help tag that describes both states.

**Important:** You must supply a descriptive label for each rectangular-style toolbar control you place in a toolbar so that users can customize the toolbarto displayboth images and text. This is the external label users seewhen theyselect the Icon & Text or Text Only displayoptions in the Customize Toolbar dialog.  
Rectangular style toolbar controls used in a bottom bar do not need external descriptive labels.  
#### Rectangular-Style Toolbar Control Specifications  
**Control sizes**: Rectangular-style toolbar controls are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. In a toolbar, display the regular size by default, but be sure to supply the small size to allow users to customize the toolbar.  
In a bottom bar, you can use either the regular or the small size, depending on the dimensions of the bottom bar. See ["Designing](#page-214-1) a Bottom Bar" (page 215) for guidelines on how to create and lay out a bottom bar.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Labels for rectangular-style toolbar controls should be in the system font appropriate for the size of the control (these fonts are automatically supplied by Interface Builder):  
■ Regular size: System font.  
■ Small: Small system font.  
■ Mini: Mini system font.  
**Control spacing**: There should be 8 pixels between individualrectangular-style toolbar controls. Note that this happens automatically, and that this spacing can change depending on the length of the external label.  
#### <span id="page-264-1"></span>Rectangular-Style Toolbar Control Implementation  
Rectangular-style toolbar controls are available in Interface Builder. In the Interface Builder library, these controls are called Round Textured Buttons. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the setBezelStyle: method of NSButtonCellwith NSTexturedRoundedBezelStyle as the argument.  
The blue glow you see behind the calendar image in the iCal segmented control (shown in [Figure](#page-263-0) [15-4](#page-263-0) (page 264)) is an effect Application Kit provides under some circumstances. The effect indicates an on state in a properly configured segmented control that behaves like a set of checkboxes or a button that behaves like a toggle button. Although it is possible that the precise appearance of this on-state look may change in future releases of Mac OS X, you can continue to receive appropriate on-state processing if you configure these two controls as described here.  
To provide a segmented control that displays an on-state appearance (similarto the segmented control in the iCal bottom bar), use an NSSegmentedControl object with style NSSegmentStyleTexturedRounded and mode NSSegmentSwitchTrackingSelectAny. Ifyou're using Interface Builder, place a Segmented Control object in your toolbar or bottom bar; in the Attributes pane of the inspector, set the style to Textured Rounded and the mode to Select Any. Be sure to provide an image for the control (in Interface Builder, select an image from the Image combo box in the Attributes pane of the inspector).  
<span id="page-264-0"></span>To provide a toggle-style button that displays an on-state appearance, use an NSButton object with style NSTexturedRoundedBezelStyle, with which you've associated an image. Be sure the button cell's showsStateBy mask contains NSContentsCellMask. This means that Application Kit uses the alternate image and title when the cell's state is NSOnState. However, to get the on-state glow do *not* provide an alternate image. If you're using Interface Builder, place a Rounded Textured Button object in your toolbar or bottom bar; in the Attributes pane of the inspector, set the mode to Toggle, provide an image, and do not provide an alternate image.
