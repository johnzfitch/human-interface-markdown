#### Menu Items  
Don't name the individual items in a menu. Begin with a verb describing what happens when you choose the item. Figure 11-11 shows an example of a help balloon for a common menu item and an example of how to write a help balloon for the same menu item when it's unavailable (dimmed).

For menu items that require more information and display a dialog box, it's not necessary to say that a dialog box appears. The user wants to know what choosing the menu item ultimately accomplishes.
