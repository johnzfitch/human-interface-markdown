Sometimes, suggesting or replicating the look and feel of the real world in your app can improve the user's experience. The guidelines in this section can help you decide whether it's appropriate to add realism to your app, and if it is, how to incorporate it successfully.  
**Determine whether depicting a real-world task helps users understand its virtual version.** The key is to make sure that adding realism enhances both understanding and usability: Improving one at the expense of the other does not make your app better. For example, even though writing and posting letters is a real-world activity that most people understand, Mail does not expect users to fold a virtual note or affix a stamp to a virtual envelope.  
**Feel free to modify a real-world depiction if doing so enhances the user's understanding.** In other words, don't feel that you must be scrupulously accurate in your rendering of realistic objects or experiences. Often, you can express your point better when you fine-tune or leave out some of the details of a real-world object or behavior.  
**Don't sacrifice clarity for artistic expression.** For example, it might make sense to show notes or photos pinned to a cork board, but it might be confusing to use a cork board background in an app that helps people create a floor plan for their home. If users need to stop and think about what your images are trying to communicate, you've decreased the usability of your app. (This concept is related to the principle of aesthetic integrity; to learn more about it, see ["Aesthetic](#page-34-0) Integrity" (page 35).)  
**Aim for realistic motion, too.** Sometimes, realistic movement can help people understand how something works even more than realistic imagery can. For example, OS X uses the rubber band effect to show users that they've scrolled to the end of a window's content or come to the last full-screen window or desktop. Take the time to investigate the physics that dictates how the objects in your UI might move so that you can enhance the user's understanding.  
**Consider enhancing physicality and realism in full-screen mode.** In Photo Booth, for example, the depiction of red velvet drapes, woodgrain, and brass controls occurs only in full-screen mode. But it's important to note that the addition of these peripheral elements does not distract users from their task, because the focus of the window remains on the main viewing area.
