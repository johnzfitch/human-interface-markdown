You can put an icon next to an item in a picker, although it is by no means necessary to do so. In fact, there are several reasons to avoid icons in pickers.  
- Icons make pickers harder for new users to operate. Studies show new users initially take extra care (and time) to tap only the icons, not the text.
- Rarely can users select a picker item solely by looking at the icons and not reading the text.  
- <span id="page-166-0"></span>■ Icons increase the size of a picker, not only in width but also in height. The larger a picker, the more it obscures what's beneath it.
- If you have one icon in a picker, you have to make companions for the other picker items. It can be hard enough to state the name or function of each picker item in a word or two, let alone to design an intelligible tiny pictogram for each item.  
Use judgment: long pickers may not benefit as much from icons as shorter ones. Then again, there's nothing like a good shape to grab a user's eye once the user has associated it with something the user is seeking in a long list.  
If you decide to include icons in a picker, try to make them useful mnemonic devices. Use icons to clarify and distinguish the wording of picker items. Avoid purely decorative doodads. Figure 5-11 illustrates the use of icons in a picker.

Do not exceed 16 pixels high by 22 pixels wide; smaller is better

Icons in lists may represent individual items or they may label some attribute of each item, such as the type of item.  
To be consistent with icons in existing pickers, a picker icon should not exceed 16 pixels in height or 22 in width. This does not mean you should go ahead and make all your icons 16 pixels high. Consider 16 pixels the maximum icon height in pickers, to be used only in it it's difficult to create a recognizable image with fewer pixels. Only two of the icons in the built-in MessagePad applications are 16 pixels high: the Log and Put Away items in the In/Out Box.  
Where possible, vary the sizes of icons in a picker. It's not uniform size that makes icons unify a picker, give visual relief, and jog users' memories. To do that, give all the icons in a picker the same visual weight and style, but unique shapes and configurations.  
Icons in a Picker **5-13**  
The standard Newton pickers automatically align each icon with its text at their vertical midpoints. If you want to adjust the centering—visually balancing the icon as opposed to mathematically centering it—you can include white pixels at the top or bottom of the icon.  
<span id="page-168-0"></span>Although some applications for Newton devices only present information to people, many applications gather data from people as well. A person can input information in a Newton application by  
- Tapping and dragging to select an input from a list or range of options provided by the application
- Writing and drawing to input text and shapes
- Typing text on an on-screen keyboard.  
The Newton interface elements that applications use for these input methods are described in the first two sections of this chapter. There's also a section on handling user errors.
