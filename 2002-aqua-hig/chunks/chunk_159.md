<span id="page-162-4"></span>In the Macintosh interface the standard pointing device is the mouse. Users can substitute other devices—such as trackballs and stylus pens—that maintain the behavior of direct manipulation of objects on screen.  
<span id="page-162-3"></span>Moving the mouse without pressing the mouse button moves the **pointer.** The onscreen pointer can assume different shapes according to the context of the application and the pointer's position. For example, in a word processor, the pointer takes the I-beam shape while it's over the text and changes to an arrow when it's over a tools palette. Change the pointer's shape *only* to provide information to the user about changes in the pointer's function.  
<span id="page-162-2"></span>Each pointer has a **hot spot**—the portion of the pointer that must be positioned over a screen object before mouse clicks have an effect on the object. The hot spot should be intuitive, such as the tip of an arrow pointer or the center point of a crosshair. Screen objects have a **hot zone**—the area that the pointer's hot spot must be within in order for mouse clicks to have an effect.
