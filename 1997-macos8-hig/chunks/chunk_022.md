A bevel button can be used as a checkbox, in which case it takes on the checkbox behavior, described in ["Checkboxes" \(page 27\)](#page-26-0), while retaining the bevel button appearance. The on, off, and mixed states are available when you use bevel buttons as checkboxes. You can use checkbox bevel buttons singly or in sets.  
Figure 2-14 shows a group of bevel buttons used as checkboxes in a text styling tool. The buttons labeled "B" for "boldface" and "U" for "underline" are in the on state because the selected range of text contains both boldfaced and underlined characters.
