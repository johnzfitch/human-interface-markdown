iPhone OS includes a handful of **table-view elements** that can extend the functionality of table views. Unless noted otherwise, these elements are suitable for use in table views only. Be sure to use these elements correctly in your application, because users are accustomed to their appearance and behavior in the built-in applications.  
**Note:** Programmatically, table-view elements are implemented in different ways. Some are accessory views of the table cell (an object that tells the table how to draw its rows) and others can be displayed when the table view enters an editing mode. See *Table View Programming Guide for iPhone OS* to learn about the different ways to manage these elements.  
- **Disclosure indicator**. When this element is present, users know they can tap anywhere in the row to see the next level in the hierarchy or the choices associated with the list item.
- Use a disclosure indicator in a row when selecting the row results in the display of another list. Don't use a disclosure indicator to reveal detailed information about the list item; instead, use a detail disclosure button for this purpose.
- **Detail disclosure button**. Users tap this element to see detailed information about the list item. (Note that you can use this element in views other than table views, to reveal additional details aboutsomething; see "Detail [Disclosure](#page-109-0) Buttons" (page 110) for more information.)
- In a table view, use a detail disclosure button in a row to display details about the list item. Note that the detail disclosure button, unlike the disclosure indicator, can perform an action that is separate from the selection of the row. For example, in Phone Favorites, tapping the row initiates a call to the contact; tapping the detail disclosure button in the row reveals more information about the contact.
- **Delete button**. Users tap this element to delete the list item. This element appears to the right of a list item when usersswipe in the row or when they tap the delete control button while in an editing context. (See Figure 8-10 for an example of this element.)
- **Delete control button**. Users tap this element to reveal and hide the Delete button for each list item. To give additional feedback to users, the horizontal minus symbol inside this button becomes vertical when users tap it to reveal the Delete button. See Figure 8-10 for an example of this element.
- In a grouped table that supports a transitory editing mode, the delete control appears outside the table view, on the left. You can see this, for example, when editing an individual's information in Contacts. In a grouped table that is in a permanent editing mode (such as the grouped tables on the back of Stocks and Weather), the delete control appears inside the table, on the left.
- In a plain table, the delete control always appears inside the table, on the left, as shown in Figure 8-10.
- **Row insert button**. Users tap this element to add a row to the list.
- **Row reorder control**. When this element is present, users can drag the row to another location in the list.
- **Checkmark**. This element appears next to a list item to show that it is currently selected.
