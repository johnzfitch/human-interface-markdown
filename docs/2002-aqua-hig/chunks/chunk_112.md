When the user attempts to close a document that has unsaved changes, present a Save Changes alert. An application that saves the contents of individual windows like most text and graphics applications—should use document-specific sheets, like the one shown in Figure 6-8, for its Save Changes alert. In an application that can display multiple views of the same file, if the user chooses the Close File command (instead of Close Window; see ["The File Menu" \(page 56\)](#page-55-0)), open the sheet on the frontmost window and change the alert message text from "document" to "file"; after the user clicks Save or Don't Save, close all open views of the file.

When a Save Changes sheet is open, the document's close button and the Close command in the File menu are unavailable; the user can't close the document until the Save Changes sheet is addressed.  
<span id="page-108-2"></span>As described in ["Sheet Behavior" \(page 97\)](#page-96-2), if an application provides multiple views of the same document, the sheet should open on the active window and prevent the user from interacting with other open views of the file.
