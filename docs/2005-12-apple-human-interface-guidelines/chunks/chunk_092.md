image, or the key signature of the music in an audio file. Information like this (called metadata) is embedded in a file by the application that created it. Spotlight's power comes from being able to extract, store, update, and organize the metadata of files to allow fast, comprehensive searches.  
Spotlight is always available to users to help them find their files on the computer. Even better, the search technologies that power Spotlight are available to developers to help them find files to display, plug-ins to load, and data to use in their applications. For example, a developer can define complex queries to find only the types of files an application needs to work with or provide Spotlight functionality from within an application. The rest of this section introduces the user's view of Spotlight and describes some of the ways an application can take advantage of its features.  
<span id="page-70-0"></span>Users can easily initiate a Spotlight search using the Spotlight icon at the far right end of the menu bar. [Figure 5-8](#page-70-0) (page 71) shows the Spotlight icon and search field displayed when a user clicks the icon.

Whichever way a search is initiated, Spotlight quickly displays the results, conveniently sorted into categories the user can adjust in Spotlight Preferences. [Figure 5-10](#page-71-0) (page 72) shows the standard Spotlight results window.

<span id="page-71-1"></span>To applications, Spotlight provides almost limitless ability to find files and to give advanced file-search capabilities to users within the context of the application. For example, an application might choose to replicate the Spotlight contextual-menu item (shown in [Figure 5-9](#page-70-1) (page 71)) with a button that initiates a Spotlight search for the user's selected text. The application could then display its own window that contains all the search results or a filtered subset of them.  
An application might also choose to give users access to Spotlight searches in a rounded search field (for more information on this control, see ["Search Fields "](#page-262-0) (page 263)). A user often needs to work on a file that was saved in an atypical place or given an unexpected or forgotten name. If an application offers only a Finder-based Open dialog, it might force the user to waste a lot of time navigating the file system, trying to remember what the file was named and where it was saved. Instead, an application can provide a Spotlight-powered search that allows the user to search the entire file system, using meaningful attributes other than the filename.  
Applications can also use Spotlight functionality behind the scenes to find needed files or plug-ins. For example, an application that provides a back-up service might allow the user to choose a broad category of file type to back up, such as images. Instead of asking users to identify all the folders that contain their images or just backing up a Pictures folder, the application could perform a Spotlight search to find every image file in the file system, regardless of its location.  
Using Mac OS X Technologies  
It's important to emphasize that Spotlight is tuned to search for files; it's not intended to do extensive text-based searching within a document. If you need to do fine-grained textual searching, you should use Search Kit technologies instead. An application that stores data in database records, for example, should not base its database search on Spotlight because the data are not stored in separate files. For more information on using Search Kit in your application, see *Search Kit Programming Guide*.  
Spotlight offers unparalleled search functionality to both users and developers. Along with these opportunities, however, comes an important developer responsibility. If your application uses a custom file format, you must supply a plug-in (called a Spotlight importer) that describes the types of metadata your file format contains. This ensures that a user will be able to search for the files your application creates using the attributes described by the metadata your files contain. For comprehensive information on how to do this, see *Spotlight Importer Programming Guide*.
