To assist users in quickly locating their information and getting back to work, onscreen help should do the following:  
- Focus on real-world user tasks.
- Get to the point quickly, so users can return to work.
- Be organized by task, not the layout or functionality of the software.  
<span id="page-235-1"></span>In large help systems, searching is often the most efficient way to locate a particular topic, particularly when users have turned to help with a specific idea about what they are trying to accomplish. To facilitate usable search results, do the following:  
- Cover one topic per page, to avoid burying some tasks.
- Title the page descriptively, using words that relate to real-world goals.
- Use Apple Help keywords to ensure synonyms and common misspellings get appropriate search results.
- Write steps and descriptions using words that appear in the interface.  
Write your help so that users can quickly find the steps on the page and can follow the steps without having to repeatedly switch between the product and the Help Viewer.  
- Don't repeat notes and warnings enforced by the interface. For example, if you have to click OK to confirm a setting, don't describe it in the steps—it will be apparent as the users follow the instructions.
- Tailor descriptions to the probable experience of users. For example, a user who wants to adjust kerning is likely to be already familiar with selecting a typeface and font size. A user who looks for help with basics such as opening a document may require more detailed instructions.
- <span id="page-235-0"></span>■ Automate common tasks using AppleScript. For example, if a task requires opening a preferences pane, provide an automation that opens it for users. If you can automate the entire task, do so.
- Emphasize trouble identification and resolution. Users might already know how to accomplish a task but turn to help because of a condition or requirement they can't identify. If a step or task might be impossible because of an error condition, remind users to check for it early in your instructions.
