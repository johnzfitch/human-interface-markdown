One of humanity's best developed talents is the ability to manipulate symbolic representations—to communicate with a variety of languages, from written or spoken verbal languages to visual and gesture languages. The Apple Desktop Interface acknowledges the importance of visual elements to communication, adding these to more traditional textual systems. Users have a primarily visual context in which to interact with the computer, and they are provided with tools with which they can create new visual objects.  
In this sense, the interface is a consistent visual language. (It is not really a desktop at all, nor is it any other "real thing.") Icons, some very realistic and others highly symbolic, are an important part of this language. Spatial layout and consistent graphical elements (such as stripes to indicate activity in a window, and highlighting to indicate selection) give users a great deal of information about ongoing activity as well as letting them participate in this activity.
