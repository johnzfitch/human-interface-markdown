Iconsthat look good in capsule-style toolbar controls are simple, colorful imagesthat don't have lots of detail. As you design an icon for a capsule-style toolbar control, keep the following points in mind:  
- Include only enough detail to unambiguously represent the object
- Use a straight-on perspective with minimal shadow
- Provide enough contrast so that the image stands out against the control background
- Consider using bright, clear colors
- <span id="page-153-1"></span>● Make sure the image is visually centered in the control (note that visually centered might not be the same as mathematically centered)
