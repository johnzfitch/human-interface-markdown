Users should be involved early in the design process so that changes in the basic concept of the product can still be made, if necessary. While there's a natural tendency to wait for a good working prototype before showing the product to anyone, this is too late for the user to have a significant impact on design. In the absence of working code, you can show test subjects alternate designs on paper or storyboards. There are lots of ways that early concepts can be tested on potential users of a product. Then, as the design progresses, the testing can become more refined and can focus on screen designs and specific features of the interface.
