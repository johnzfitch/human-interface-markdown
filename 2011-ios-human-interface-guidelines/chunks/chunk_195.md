For your iPhone app, create a document icon in two sizes:  
- 22 x 29 pixels
- 44 x 58 pixels (high resolution)  
Place your custom artwork within each rectangular space as desired. The artwork can be centered, offset, or it can fill the entire space.  
For example, if you supply a 22 x 29 pixel icon that looks like the image on the left, iOS creates a document icon that has a drop shadow so it looks like the image on the right:

Similarly, if you supply a 44 x 58 pixel icon that looks like the image on the left, iOS creates a document icon that that has a drop shadow so it looks like the image on the right:
