A **combination box** (or combo box) is a text entry field combined with a pop-up menu or a drop-down scrolling list. Combo boxes are useful for displaying a list of likely choices while still allowing the user to type in an item not in the list.

The default state of the combo box is closed, with the text field empty or displaying a default selection. The default selection (not necessarily the first item in the list) should provide a meaningful clue to the hidden choices. The combo box should also have a useful label.
