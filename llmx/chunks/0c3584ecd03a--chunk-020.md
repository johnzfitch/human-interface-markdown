<!-- Chunk 20 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 109 -->
The NeXTSTEP user interface is designed with certain basic principles in mind. Four are especially important:  
- The interface should be consistent across all applications.
- The user is in charge of the workspace and its windows.
- The interface should feel natural to the user.
- The mouse (not the keyboard) is the primary instrument for user input.  
Each of these principles is discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
