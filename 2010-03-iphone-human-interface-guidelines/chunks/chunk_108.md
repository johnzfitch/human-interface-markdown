Table views are extremely useful in iPhone applications because they provide attractive ways to organize both large and small amounts of information. Table views are most useful in productivity applications that tend to handle lots of user items, although utility applications can make use of smaller-scale table views, as well. An immersive application would probably not use a table view to display information, but it might use one to display a short list of options.  
Table Views, Text Views, and Web Views  
Table views provide built-in elements that allow users to navigate and manipulate information. In addition, table views support:  
- The display of header and footer information. You can display descriptive text above or below each section or group in a list, and above or below the list as a whole.
- List editing. You can allow users to add, remove, and reorder list items in a consistent way. Table views also support the selection and manipulation of multiple list items, which you might use to give users a convenient way to delete more than one list item at a time.  
**A table should always provide feedback when users select a list item**. When an item can be selected, the row containing the item highlights briefly when the user selects it, providing feedback that the selection has been received. Then, an immediate action occurs: Either a new view isrevealed or the row displays a checkmark to indicate that the item has been selected or enabled.  
In rare cases, a row might remain highlighted when secondary details or controls related to the row item are displayed in the same screen. However, thisis not encouraged because it is difficult to display a list of choices, a selected item, and related details or controls without creating an uncomfortably crowded layout.  
If a row selection results in navigation to a new screen, the selected row highlights briefly as the new screen slides into place. When the user navigates back to the previous screen, the originally selected row again highlights briefly to remind the user of their earlier selection.  
Note that you can also animate the changes users make to list items. Doing so is a good way to provide feedback and strengthen the user's sense of direct manipulation. In Settings, for example, when you turn off the automatic date and time setting (by selecting Off in Date & Time > Set Automatically), the list group expands smoothly to display two new items, Time Zone and Set Date & Time.  
**A table should display content immediately**. If the table's content is extensive or complex, avoid waiting until all the data is available before displaying anything. Instead, fill the onscreen rows with textual data immediately and display more complex data (such asimages) asthey become available. Thistechnique gives users useful information right away and increases the perceived responsiveness of your application.  
If your application displays data that changes infrequently, you might consider displaying "stale" data while waiting for new data to become available. This technique also allows users to see something useful right away, but it is not recommended for applicationsthat handle data that changesfrequently. Before you decide to do this, gauge how often the data changes and how much users depend on seeing fresh data quickly.  
<span id="page-89-0"></span>If it's difficult to display anything useful right away, it's important to avoid displaying empty rows, because this can imply that the application has stalled. Instead, the table should display a spinning activity indicator along with an informative label, such as "Loading...", centered in the screen. If you can display older data, you don't have to worry about blank rows, but you should update onscreen rows as soon as possible. Both techniques provide feedback to users, letting them know that processing is continuing.
