When a character is typed, the current selection is deleted from the document and the character replaces it. If there is no active folder, and thus no current selection, or if the current selection cannot be replaced by text (as in an all-graphics application with no captions), then a beep is sounded when typing is attempted.  
If typing makes the caret go beyond the folder edge, the document will be scrolled back so the caret is visible.  
When the user starts to type, the caret stops blinking. When the user stops typing and the system has caught up, the caret starts blinking again.  
32. KEYS THAT ALTER THE MEANINGS OF OTHER KEYS  
The SHIFT, ALPHA LOCK, APPLE, and CODE keys are neither command keys nor printing character keys. When any other key is pressed, its meaning hinges partially on what combination of those four keys is currently depressed.
