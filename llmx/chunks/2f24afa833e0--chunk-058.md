For the most part, pressing is an alternative to repeated clicking. It should be used wherever a control action can be repeated with incremental effect. For example, clicking a scroll button scrolls one line of text, clicking the button again scrolls another line, and so on. Pressing the scroll button scrolls lines repeatedly for a continuous action until the mouse button is released.  
Pressing is also used to initiate the action of sliding from one object to another. If a button controls a pop-up list, the user presses the button and drags through the list to choose one of its options. After pressing a menu command to bring up a submenu, the user can drag into the submenu.
