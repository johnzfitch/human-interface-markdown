## 24. THE MENU BAR

Across the full width of the top of the screen there is always a thin band of white called the menu bar. It is tall enough for one line of characters, and displays the titles of a set of menus which currently make sense. Most of the menus operate on the selection in the active folder. Some may operate on the active folder as a whole; or on a group of related folders, or even on the whole LISA system. The menu bar is the main means by which a user tells LISA what to do.

The menu bar contains a number of words, each of which is the title of a "pull-down" menu. If the cursor is moved with the button up to one of the menu titles, the cursor shape changes to an apple. If the mouse button is pressed, the menu title becomes highlighted in inverse and the associated menu pops out, hanging down below the menu bar.

If you drag the cursor across the menu bar while holding down the button, each menu will pop out in succession and you will be able to see all the menu items that are currently available to you.

Each menu is a list of choices among a collection of commands, objects or other menus. The items in a menu may be arranged linearly, or in an array, and may be textual, graphical or even dynamic.

Menu choices are directives, not state indicators (e.g. Turn Printer On rather than Printer Off). However, often the user can tell what states (if any) are in effect (see below).
