You can provide the ability for people to look at different parts of a document simultaneously by implementing a split bar. The **split bar** is a control, five pixels high by the width of the scroll bar, contained in the scroll bar. Users drag the split bar to separate a document into separate scrolling sections, called **window panes.** A **split line** appears to visually separate the panes. (Note that there should a one-pixel space between the two lines that make up the split line.) For example, the user might want to look at the opening paragraphs and review the conclusion of a document in a word-processing  
program at the same time. In a programming environment, you might want to see the include statements at the beginning of a document while looking at routines in another part of the document. Split windows are useful for copying data from one part of a document and pasting it into another part. The user drags the split bar to a location in the scroll bar where the new pane is to begin. To remove a window pane, the user drags the split bar to within three pixels of the top or right of the scroll bar. Figure 5-40 shows a window split into two panes.

The split bar should be large enough for the user to accurately place the pointer on it, but not so large that it attracts attention. Figure 5-41 shows an example of the correct size for a split bar and some comparison sizes.

Window Behaviors **171**

#### Window Pane Behavior  
When you implement window splitting capabilities, place the split bar at the top of the vertical scroll bar or to the left of the horizontal scroll bar, or in both positions if you support both types of splits. The user can drag the split bar anywhere along the scroll bar. Implement an outline of the split line to follow the pointer so that the user can tell where the new pane will appear. (This is similar to the outline of a scroll box being moved.) Releasing the mouse button splits the window into panes there, and divides the appropriate scroll bar into separate scroll bars for each pane.  
After a single split, there are separate scroll bars for each pane. Usually the panes scroll independently in the orientation opposite of the split. That is, if the split is horizontal, the vertical scrolling is controlled separately for each pane using the two scroll bars along the right of the window. The horizontal scrolling is still synchronous, or locked, using the scroll bar along the bottom of the window. Figure 5-42 shows how window panes scroll, independently or together.

When the user splits a window, any part of the window's contents obscured by the split line or scroll bar should move down so that it is visible. For example, if the user drags a split bar to create a horizontal split, the window's contents that would have disappeared underneath the split line should scroll down by the height of the split line, plus some additional space.  
The user can make a selection in one pane, and where the same data appears in another pane, the user can Shift-click to extend the selection. See the section "Editing Text" beginning on page 300 in Chapter 10, "Behaviors," for more information on selecting text. The user should also be able to drag to extend a selection and have the pane scroll automatically as an entire window would.  
Your application should save and restore the location of split lines and the content of window panes whenever the user closes a document that is divided into panes.  
#### One Split per Orientation  
You can choose to allow only one split in a window. Usually the panes are locked in the direction of the split and the panes move independently in the opposite direction. For example, in a text document if you allow one horizontal split, then the panes move together when the user scrolls horizontally, but the user can scroll to different locations in the vertical direction to see different parts of the content.  
Window Behaviors **173**

This chapter describes the dialog boxes that you use in your products. It gives recommendations for when to use each kind of dialog box and what behaviors you need to implement for dialog boxes. This chapter also provides information on the standard layout of dialog boxes, the language to use in dialog boxes, and the standard appearance and behavior of the standard file dialog boxes and the save changes alert box.  
Dialog boxes are windows that provide a standard framework in which the computer can present alternatives from which the user can choose. The purpose of dialog boxes is to elicit responses from the user, typically several responses at one time. For example, the Print dialog box allows the user to specify the number of copies to be printed, the pages to be printed, whether there should be a title page, and other print-related options. When the user chooses a menu item that is followed by the ellipsis character (…), a dialog box appears. (Note that the appearance of a dialog box does not necessarily mean there should be an ellipsis character after a menu item.) All requests for information in dialog boxes should be phrased in plain language and in a nonthreatening manner.  
Alert boxes appear when the system software or an application needs to communicate information to the user. Alert boxes provide messages about error conditions and warn users about potentially hazardous situations or actions. An alert box is a type of dialog box and thus follows many of the same guidelines.  
From a programming perspective, dialog boxes and alert boxes are windows. In the language of the human interface, dialog boxes and alert boxes are considered unique elements, each with a specific appearance and behavior, as described in this chapter. A dialog box is a rectangle that may contain text, controls, and icons. Each dialog box contains some text to indicate which command or condition caused it to be displayed and what its function is. In some cases this text is a title for the dialog box. The text in a dialog box should be in the system font size, which is normally 12-point type. Text that is smaller than the system font size sometimes cannot be localized.  
Controls, such as buttons, radio buttons, and checkboxes, are described in Chapter 7, "Controls," which begins on page 203. Text entry fields in a dialog box follow the guidelines given in Chapter 10, "Behaviors," which begins on page 267.  
In general you use four types of dialog boxes in your application:  
Modeless dialog boxes, which are useful for getting user input and for making changes to a document. Once open, they are available until the user closes them.  
- Movable modal dialog boxes, which are useful for requesting user input and for making changes to a document *while* allowing the user to switch to another application. Also useful for allowing the user to see parts of a document that might be obscured by a modal dialog box.
- Modal dialog boxes, which are useful for forcing the user to provide necessary information before carrying out the current operation.
- Alert boxes (a type of modal dialog box), which are useful for communicating error conditions or preventing any other activity until the user responds to the error condition.  
Figure 6-1 shows examples of these types of dialog boxes. The sections that follow describe the appearance and behavior of each type of dialog box. See the chapter "Dialog Manager" in *Inside Macintosh: Macintosh Toolbox Essentials* for information on implementing these types of dialog boxes.  
Be aware that users can change the colors of standard dialog boxes by using the Color control panel; this is particularly important if you decide to create custom alert boxes, modeless dialog boxes, movable modal dialog boxes, or modal dialog boxes. If you use the default window color table with your custom window definitions, you can be sure that the colors you use are consistent with any color that the user has access to with the Color control panel. You can use the Palette Manager to associate a color palette with a window definition. For more information, see the discussion of the Palette Manager in *Inside Macintosh.*
