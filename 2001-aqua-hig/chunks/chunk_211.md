To select a single field (cell), the user clicks in it. The user can also select a field by moving to it with the Tab or Return key.  
To select part of the contents of a field, the user must first select the field, then click again to select the desired part.  
Selecting **183**  
A user should be able to select a row or column in a table by clicking a header, for example. Tables can also support Command-click for selecting discontinuous fields.  
Pressing the Tab key cycles through the fields in an order determined by your application, and Shift-Tab navigates in the opposite direction. Typically, the sequence is from left to right, then from top to bottom. Pressing Tab from the last field selects the first field.  
<span id="page-183-4"></span><span id="page-183-3"></span>The Return key selects the first field in the next row; Shift-Return selects the previous row. If the concept of rows doesn't make sense in a particular context, the Return key should have the same effect as the Tab key.
