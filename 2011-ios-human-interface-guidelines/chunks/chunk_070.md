**Avoid associating different actions with the standard gestures users know**. Just as important, avoid creating custom gestures to invoke the actions users already associate with the standard gestures.  
**Use complex gestures as shortcuts to expedite a task, not as the only way to perform a task**. Although most users know the more complex standard gestures,such asswipe, or pinch open, these complex gestures are not as common.  
For example, when viewing a list of messages in Mail, users delete a message by revealing and then tapping the Delete button in the preview row for the message. Users can reveal the Delete button in two different ways:  
- Tap the Edit button in the navigation bar, which reveals a delete control in each preview row. Then, tap the delete control in a specific preview row to reveal the Delete button for that message.
- This method takes an extra step, but is easily discoverable because it requires only the tap and begins with the clearly labeled Edit button.
- Make the swipe gesture across a preview row to reveal the Delete button for that message.  
This method isfaster, but it requiresthe user to learn and remember the more specialized swipe gesture.  
Try to ensure that there is always a simple, straightforward way to perform an action, even if it means an extra tap or two. Simple gestures allow users to focus on the experience and the content, not the interaction.  
**In general, avoid defining new gestures**. When you introduce new gestures, users must make an effort to discover and remember them. The primary exception to this recommendation is an app that enables an immersive experience, in which custom gestures can be appropriate. For example, a document-creation application that requires users to make a circular gesture to reveal the Delete button in a table row would be confusing and difficult to use. But a game might reasonably require users to make a circular gesture to spin a game piece.  
Be sure the gestures you use make sense in the context of your application'sfunctionality and the expectations of your users. If, for example, your application enables an important task that users perform frequently and want to complete quickly, you should probably use only standard gestures. But if your application contains realistic controlsthat dictate a specific usage, or provides an environment that users expect to explore, custom gestures can be appropriate. (For more information about the standard gestures, see "Apps [Respond](#page-13-1) to [Gestures,](#page-13-1) Not Clicks" (page 14).)  
**For iPad, consider using multifinger gestures**. The large iPad screen provides great scope for custom multifinger gestures, including gestures made by more than one person. Although complex gestures are not appropriate for every application, they can enrich the experience in applications that people spend a lot of time in, such as games or content-creation environments. Always bear in mind that nonstandard gestures aren't discoverable and should rarely, if ever, be the only way to perform an action.
