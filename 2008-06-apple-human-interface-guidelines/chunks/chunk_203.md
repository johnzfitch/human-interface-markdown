Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides several images you can use as standalone icons in toolbars. These images are represent three types of items:  
- System entities or elements
- Preferences categories  
#### ■ Common toolbar items  
Use the first set of images (shown in Table 11-3) to give users access to system entities, such as Dot Mac and network. For the most part, the images in Table 11-3 identify system entities, they do not represent actions. However, if you needed to represent an action, such as "create a new smart folder," you could add a plus sign badge to the smart folder icon.

<span id="page-154-1"></span>The second set of images is intended for use as standalone icons in preferences window toolbars. Use these images to give users access to familiar preferences categories, such as user-account settings and advanced settings. Table 11-4 shows the images you can use in a preferences window toolbar.
