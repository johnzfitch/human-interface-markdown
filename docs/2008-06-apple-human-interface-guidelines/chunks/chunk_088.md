If you develop applications that need to communicate with other computers and processes on the Internet or a local area network, you should avoid making assumptions about the user's network settings. Ensuring fast, efficient connections to other programs and computers is an important part of providing a good user experience.  
<span id="page-70-3"></span>Mac OS X supports a dynamically updating networking model. Because a user may change IP addresses many times during a single session, don'tsave settings based on the IP address. Use Bonjour whenever a user might otherwise be required to set an IP address. Bonjour enables automatic discovery of computers, devices, and services on IP networks. The use of Bonjour can dramatically simplify network configuration for your users. For more information on Bonjour, see *Bonjour Overview*.
