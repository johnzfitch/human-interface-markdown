#### **The Menu Bar**

/

(

The menu bar contains a number of words and phrases that are the titles of the menus associated with the current application. Each application has its own menu bar. The names of the menus do not change, except when the user opens a desk accessory that then adds a new menu to the menu bar.

Nothing but menu titles can appear in the menu bar. If *all* the operations in a given menu are currently disabled (that is, the user can't choose them), the menu title should be dimmed (drawn in gray) but should remain visible in the menu bar. The user must always be able

to pull down the menu and see the names of the operations even when none of them can, at the moment, be chosen.
