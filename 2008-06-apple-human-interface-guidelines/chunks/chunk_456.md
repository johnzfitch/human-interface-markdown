A **separator** is a thin vertical or horizontal line. Separators have a lightweight appearance that's good for separating controls into categories or subgroups of related functionality. For example, the Appearance preferences pane (shown in Figure 15-88) provides controls that determine a wide range of high-level  
appearance characteristics,such as highlight color and the placement ofscroll arrows. Although each control affects some aspect of the Mac OS X appearance, the window uses separators to create four subgroups of related controls.
