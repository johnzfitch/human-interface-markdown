- Are questions in dialogs posed in a straightforward and positive way—for example, "Do you want to erase everything on the disk named "Macintosh HD?" rather than "Do you not want to alter the contents of this disk?"
- Do you use sheets for document-specific dialogs?
- Are dialogs designed with a centered look (rather than flush left)?
- Are dialogs horizontally centered either on the screen or over the active window if the window is on a large screen or on a screen other than the one the menu bar appears on?
- Do you use modal dialogs only when necessary? If a movable modal dialog is displayed, can the application run in the background? Can the system Help menu be used when a modal dialog is displayed?
- If there is an active text input field in a modal dialog, can the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo menu commands in the Edit menu be used?
