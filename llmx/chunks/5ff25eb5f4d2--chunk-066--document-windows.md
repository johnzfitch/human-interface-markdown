#### **Document Windows**  
Document indows are the areas on the screen where applications can display the information contained in a document. Because a document may contain more information than the window can display at one time, the window provides a view of a portion of a document. Document indows also provide a graphic representation of opening, closing, and other operations performed on documents. Windows are usually, but not necessarily, rectangles. Figure 38 shows a standard document window and its components.
