# Pop-Up Menus

- Do pop-up menus have a downward-pointing triangle and a one-pixel drop shadow? While the menu is showing, is its title inverted and is the current value checked? If the menu must be scrolled, is this indicated by a triangle pointing up or down?
- Are pop-up menus used to allow the user to choose only *one* of a set of several choices? Pop-up menus should not be used for choosing more than one item from a set of several choices.
- Do you avoid adding menu items that contain verbs (actions) in pop-up menus?
- Is the same font used for the normal state and the open state of a pop-up menu?
- Do you avoid making the pop-up menu narrower in the open state than in the closed state?
