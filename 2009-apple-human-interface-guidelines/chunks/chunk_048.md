When you use existing interface building blocks, use them in the standard way. Make sure you do not change the behavior of standard elements. When you need a new behavior, design a new element for it. If elements behave differently in differentsituations, the interface becomes unpredictable and therefore harder to figure out. This can adversely affect the user's confidence in your application.
