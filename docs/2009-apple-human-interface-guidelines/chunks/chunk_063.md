<span id="page-63-2"></span>Whenever possible, include support for industry-standard file formatsin your documents. Supporting standard file formats makes it easier to exchange data between your application and other applications. Users might also be more inclined to use your application if they know they can get their data into and out of it easily.  
When saving user-configurable data, make sure you store it in a plain-text file that the user can modify. Mac OS X applications traditionally store configuration data using XML. You can write out XML data using the preferences system and the XML support found in Core Foundation and Cocoa. For information about user preferences, see *Runtime Configuration Guidelines*.  
Many platforms rely on the existence of filename extensions to identify the type of a file. Although many longtime Mac OS X developers may decry their use, filename extensions make it easier for users to exchange files with users of those other platforms. Applications that save documents should be sure to include a filename extension appropriate to the contents of the document. At the same time, however, applications should take care to respect the user's filename extension preferences when displaying the names of files and documents.
