Save makes permanent any changes to the active document since the last time it was saved. It leaves the document open.  
If the user chooses Save for a new document that hasn't been named yet, the application presents the Save As dialog (see below) to name the document, and then continues with the save. The active document remains active.  
If there's not enough room on the disk to save the document, the application asks if the user wants to save the document on another disk. If the answer is yes, the application goes through the Save As dialog to find out which disk.

Save As saves a copy of the active document under a file name provided by the user.  
If the document already has a name, Save As closes the old version of the document, creates a copy, and displays the copy in the window.  
If the document is untitled, Save As saves the original document under the specified name. The active document remains active.
