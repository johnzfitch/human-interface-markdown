Suchman, Lucy. *Plans and Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-Machine Communication*. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1987.  
Provides a good introduction to the psychology behind interface issues and human-machine interaction. It reviews many of the issues involved in the application of psychology, anthropology, and sociology to people's everyday actions.
