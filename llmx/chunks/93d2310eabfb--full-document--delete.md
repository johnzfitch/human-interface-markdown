### Delete

When the user presses the Delete key (or Control-D), one of two things happens:

- If the current selection is one or more characters, it's deleted.
- If the current selection is an insertion point, the previous character is deleted.

In both cases, the deleted characters don't go into the Clipboard, and the insertion point replaces the deleted characters in the document.
