#### Figure 48 Pointers

During a particularly lengthy operation, when the user can do nothing but wait until the operation is completed, the pointer may change its shape and become a status or progress indicator. This indicator lets the user know that the system hasn't died—it's just busy. The standard pointer used for this purpose is a wristwatch. Some applications use the "spinning beachball" pointer to show that all is well during longer operations. The kindest applications use a dial to show the passing of time, either in absolute terms or as a proportion of the total, or both. (Figure 49 is an example.)
