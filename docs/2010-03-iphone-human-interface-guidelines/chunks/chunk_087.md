A navigation bar appears at the upper edge of an application screen, just below the status bar. A navigation bar usually displays the title of the current view and can contain controls that act on the view's contents, in addition to navigational controls when appropriate. Navigation bars are especially useful in productivity applications(described in "Productivity [Applications"](#page-18-0) (page 19)), because these applicationstypically arrange information in a hierarchy.  
Navigation bars have two purposes:  
■ To enable navigation among different views in an application  
Navigation Bars, Tab Bars, Toolbars, and the Status Bar  
■ To provide controls that manage the items in a view  
<span id="page-68-1"></span>Figure 6-3 shows examples of both these uses.  
**Figure 6-3** Navigation bars can contain navigational controls and controls to manage content
