A user can extend a selection by holding down the Shift key and clicking the mouse button. This action is called **Shift-clicking.** Exactly what happens next depends on the context.  
In text or an array, the result of the Shift-click is always the selection of a range. The position where the button is clicked becomes the new endpoint of the range. If the user Shift-clicks within the current range, the new range will be smaller than the old range. Usually, if the user then Shift-clicks in another location, the additional data is included in the selection. In arrays, however, a different paradigm can be implemented in which the selection always moves from the current cell to wherever the user Shift-clicks, changing rather than extending the selection. This model works only in applications such as arrays, where the current cell is highlighted and the user can always see the active cell. In this case, the user always knows the fixed point from which the selection will start.  
Selecting **289**  
Extended selections can be made, even across the panes of a split window. Figure 10-16 shows the effect of extending and shrinking a range of text using Shift-click.

There are two methods for extending a continuous selection using Shift-click: the addition method and the fixed-point method. The **addition method** is based on *adding* new text to a current selection. The **fixed-point method** establishes a fixed location for the insertion point and allows the user to extend the selection on *either* side of the fixed point. Figure 10-16 illustrates the results of three consecutive steps in both the addition method and the fixed-point method.

<span id="page-314-0"></span>When considering which method to use in your application, keep in mind that the addition method provides more flexibility by allowing users to extend a selection in *both* directions rather than in only one direction, as in the fixed-point method. The addition method also provides greater consistency in terms of *extending* a selection; the fixed-point method can actually end up *shrinking* a selection rather than extending it, as shown in Figure 10-16. In both methods, if the user positions the insertion point within a selection and Shift-clicks, the selection is shortened from the right side of the selection to the location of the insertion point.  
In graphics applications, objects aren't usually considered to be in any particular sequence. A selection is extended by adding objects to it, and the added objects do not have to be adjacent to the objects already selected. The user can add either an individual object or a range of objects to the selection by holding down the Shift key before making the additional selection (Shift-click). When the user does this, the objects between the current selection and the new object are not automatically included in the selection. This kind of selection is called **discontinuous selection.** If the user holds down the Shift key and selects one or more objects that are already highlighted, the objects are removed from the selection or are deselected.
