- <span id="page-260-2"></span>■ Do you use standard Aqua controls provided by the system, instead of inventing custom ones? Do you avoid assigning new behaviors to existing interface elements?
- Does the application have the Mac OS X "feel," including window minimization, live scrolling, live window dragging, and sheets?
- If a metaphor is being used, is it suitable for the application? Does the metaphor match a "real" visual and behavioral representation?
- Is the user always able to find an object or action on the screen? In other words, does your interface follow the see-and-point principle of design?
