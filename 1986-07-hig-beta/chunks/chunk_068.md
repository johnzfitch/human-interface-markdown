Clicking or pressing one of the scroll arrows lets the user see more of the document in the direction of the scroll arrow, so it moves the document in the *opposite* direction from the arrow. For example, when the user clicks the top scroll arrow, the document moves down, bringing the view closer to the top of the document. The scroll box moves toward the arrow being clicked.  
Each click in a scroll arrow causes movement a distance of one unit in the chosen direction, with the unit of distance being appropriate to the application: one line for a word processor, one row or column for a spreadsheet, and so on. Within a document, units should always be the same size, for smooth scrolling. Pressing the scroll arrow causes continuous movement in its direction.  
#### Scrolling by Windowful  
Clicking the mouse anywhere in the gray area of the scroll bar advances the document by a windowful. The scroll box, and the document view, move toward the place where the user clicked. Clicking *below* the scroll box, for example, brings the user the next windowful toward the bottom of the document. Pressing in the gray area causes the display of consecutive windowfuls until the user releases the mouse button, or until the location of the scroll box catches up to the location of the pointer. Each windowful is the height or width of the window, minus one unit overlap (where a unit is the distance the view scrolls when the scroll arrow is clicked once).  
In both the above schemes, the user moves the document in increments until it's in the desired position under the window. The user can also move the document directly to any position by dragging the scroll box to the corresponding position in the scroll bar. To move the scroll box, the user drags it along the scroll bar; an outline of the scroll box follows the pointer. When the mouse button is released, the scroll box jumps to the position last held by the outline, and the document jumps to the position corresponding to the new position of the scroll box.  
#### Scrolling by Dragging the Scroll Box  
If the user starts dragging the scroll box, and then moves the pointer a certain distance outside the scroll bar, the scroll box stops following the pointer and snaps back to its original position. If the user then releases the mouse button, no scrolling occurs. But if the user, still holding down the mouse button, moves the pointer back *into* the scroll bar, the scroll box again begins to move up and down with the pointer.  
If a document has a fixed size, and the user scrolls to the right or bottom edge of the document, the application displays a light gray background between the edge of the document and the window frame.  
Some applications put the page number inside the scroll box so that the user can see the page number change as the document scrolls.  
#### **Automatic Scrolling**  
There are three instances when the application, rather than the user, scrolls the document. These instances involve some potentially sticky problems about how to position the document within the window after scrolling.  
- The first case is when the user moves the pointer out of the window while either selecting by dragging or while moving a selection with the mouse or with arrow keys. The window keeps up with the selection by scrolling automatically in the direction the pointer has been moved. The rate of scrolling is the same as if the user were pressing on the corresponding scroll arrow or arrows.
- The second case is when the user performs an operation on a selection that isn't currently showing in the window. When this happens, it's usually because the user has scrolled the document after making a selection. In this case, the application scrolls the window so that the selection is showing before performing the operation.
- The third case is when the application performs an operation whose side effect is to make a new selection or move the insertion point. An example is a search operation, after which the object of the search is selected. If this object isn't showing in the window, the application must scroll the document to show it. Another example: After a paste operation, the insertion point is after the end of the thing that was pasted.  
The second and third cases present the same problem: Where should the selection be positioned within the window after scrolling? The primary rule is that the application should avoid unnecessary scrolling. Users prefer to retain control over the positioning of a document. The following guidelines should be helpful:  
- If part of the new selection is already showing in the window, don't scroll at all. An exception to this rule is when the part of the selection that isn't showing is more important than the part that is showing.
- If scrolling in *one* orientation (either horizontal or vertical) is enough to reveal the selection, don't scroll in both orientations.
- If the selection is smaller than the window, position the selection so that some of its context is showing on each side. It's better to put the selection somewhere near the middle of the window than right up against the corner.
- Even if the selection is too large to show in the window, it might be preferable to show some context rather than to try to fit as much as possible of the selection in the window.  
#### Splitting a Window  
Sometimes users want to see (and work on) two separate parts of a document simultaneously. They can do this by splitting the window into independently scrollable panes.  
Applications that support splitting a window into panes place split bars at the top of the vertical scroll bar and to the left of the horizontal one. Pressing a split bar attaches it to the pointer. Dragging the split bar positions it anywhere along the scroll bar. Releasing the mouse button creates a new split bar at that location and splits the window there, and divides the appropriate scroll bar into separate scroll bars for each pane.

Figure 43. Types of Split Windows  
After a split, the document looks the same, except for the split line lying across it. But there are now separate scroll bars for each pane. The panes are still scrolled together in the orientation of the split, but can be scrolled independently in the other orientation. For example, if the split is vertical, then vertical scrolling (using the scroll bar along the right of the window) is still synchronous; horizontal scrolling is controlled separately for each pane, using the two scroll bars along the bottom of the window.

Figure 44. Scrolling a Split Window  
To remove a split (to return the window to a single pane), the user drags the split bar to either end of the scroll bar.  
Even though there can be multiple panes, there can still be only one selection (the highlighted selection may appear in all of the panes, in none of the panes, or in any number in between). If a change is made in one pane, the change is reflected in all panes where that portion of the document is visible. If the application has to scroll automatically to show the selection, the pane that should be scrolled is the last one the user clicked in. If the selection is already showing in one of the panes, no automatic scrolling takes place.  
#### **Panels**  
If the application divides a document window more or less permanently into different areas, each having a different content, these areas are called **panels**. Unlike panes, which show different parts of the same document but are functionally identical, panels are functionally different from each other but might show different interpretations of the same part of the document. For example—one panel might show a graphic version of the document while another panel shows a text version, or one panel might show a numerical representation of some data while another shows a graph based on the same data.  
Panels, like windows can have scroll bars and can be split into more than one pane. Whether to use panels instead of separate windows is up to the application. Multiple panels in the same window are more compact than separate windows, but they have to be opened, moved, and closed as a unit.
