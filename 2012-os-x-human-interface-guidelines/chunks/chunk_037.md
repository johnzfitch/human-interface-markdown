An easy-to-use app offers a well-designed, intuitive interface that supports elegant solutions to complex problems. In addition, easy-to-use apps give users tools that are relevant in the current context, eliminating or disabling irrelevant tools.  
**When appropriate, use metaphors that represent concrete, familiar ideas.** Appropriate metaphors allow people to apply their existing knowledge and experience to the usage of your app. (To learn more about the principle of metaphors, see ["Metaphors"](#page-26-1) (page 27).) For example, OS X uses the familiar metaphor of a file folder to represent a container for storing documents. Be sure to use metaphors that fit the tasks in your app: If you have to distort a metaphor to make it apply to a task, you're more likely to confuse people than to help them.  
**Make sure your app description clearly states what users need in order to use your app.** This applies to any packaging you supply, too. Users need to know your app's system requirements before they install it, so that they can begin using it right away. For example, the App Store description for Garage Band mentions operating system and processor requirements, among other things.

**Use progressive disclosure to presentthe most common choices first.** The technique of **progressive disclosure** consists of hiding additional information or more complex UI until the user needs or requestsit. Using progressive disclosure can improve your app in two ways: It helps novice users understand your app without being overwhelmed with information or features they don't need, while at the same time giving more experienced users access to the advanced features they want.  
**When appropriate, use panels to simplify the UI.** An uncluttered user interface is essential, but the availability of certain key features and settings the user needs is equally so. A **panel** can be a good way to offer frequently needed controls and options that affect the current document or selection. For example, Keynote offers an inspector panel that gives users a convenient way to adjust objects in a slide.

Because panels remain open until users close them, it's important to weigh their utility against the screen space they take up. To learn more about using panels in your app, see ["Panels"](#page-208-0) (page 209).  
**As much as possible, arrange menus so that they reflect the hierarchy of objects in your app.** For example, if your app helps users create computer animation, the app-specific menus might be Scenes, Characters, Backgrounds, and Projects. Because a user probably seesthe project as a high-level entity that containsscenes, each of which contains backgrounds and characters, a natural ordering of these menus might be Projects, Scenes, Backgrounds, and Characters.  
In general, place the menus that display commands to handle high-level, more universal objects toward one end of the menu bar and the menus that focus on the more specific entities toward the opposite end. When your app is used in countries that use left-to-right scripts, the high-level menus should appear on the left; in countries that use right-to-left scripts, the high-level menus should appear on the right. For more information about designing the menus in your app, see "UI Element [Guidelines:](#page-131-0) Menus" (page 132).  
**Don't use dynamic menu items merely to shorten app menus.** A dynamic menu item (that is, a menu item that changes when the user presses a modifier key) can be a good way to provide a shortcut for sophisticated users, but it can be difficult for inexperienced users to discover. In general, it's better to list all important commands in a menu, even if it makes the menu a bit longer.  
**Display an informative, actionable alert message when something goes wrong.** An alert should clearly convey what happened, why it happened, and the options for proceeding. Describe a workaround if one is available and do whatever you can to prevent the user from losing any data. Avoid using an alert to deliver information that the user can't act upon. For detailed guidelines on creating good alert messages, see ["Alerts"](#page-235-0) (page 236).  
**Use display names in place ofraw pathnames and filenames.** In general, it does not help usersto be exposed to the way apps handle files and data. It's better to use the terms that users define for their content and to hide filesystem details unless users explicitly choose to see them. Be sure to pay attention to the user's established language and filename extension preferences so that you can display their content as they expect.
