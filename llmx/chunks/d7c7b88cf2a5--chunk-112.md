<!-- Chunk 112 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 156 -->
When naming buttons in an attention panel, you should label each one clearly with a verb or verb phrase describing the action it performs. The user shouldn't have to read the text of the attention panel to be able to choose the right button. Thus, generic labels (like *Yes*  and *No)* aren't appropriate, as they tend to cause user errors. Avoid using *OK* unless it's the only button in the attention panel.  
Good names for attention panel buttons include:
