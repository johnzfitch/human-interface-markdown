**Little arrows** provide the user with a means of increasing or decreasing values in a series. This control consisting of two arrows pointing in opposite directions. [Figure 2-20](#page-35-0) shows the little arrows control in its normal state, with the up arrow depressed, with the down arrow depressed, and in its disabled state.

The little arrows control has a label that specifies the content to which it relates. If the user clicks the up arrow, the value displayed is incremented by one unit of change. If the user presses the arrow, the value increases or decreases until the user releases the mouse button. While the user presses the arrow, it is highlighted to provide feedback to the user.  
The unit of change depends on the content. If the content area displays years, the increment is one year. If you used little arrows to control the size of a RAM cache, however, you might use multiples of 32K as the increment (as in Figure 2-21.)
