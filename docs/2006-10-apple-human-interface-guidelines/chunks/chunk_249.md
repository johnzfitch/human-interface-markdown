Mac OS X includes standard windows for users to select fonts or colors. If you need a way for users to set fonts or colors, use these standard windows instead of making your own. In this way, users don't have to learn a new way to accomplish a familiar task.  
By implementing these windows, you get the correct utility window behavior.
