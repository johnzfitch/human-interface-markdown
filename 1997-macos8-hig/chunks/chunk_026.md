The **clock control** combines the edit text field [\(page 41\)](#page-40-0) and little arrows control [\(page 35\)](#page-34-0) into a convenient implementation of the familiar Date & Time control panel. The user can change the time and date displayed by using the little arrows or by typing the value into the edit text field. [Figure 2-22](#page-36-0) shows a clock control displaying a date.

The clock control supports keyboard navigation and focus [\(page 66\)](#page-65-0), as well as direct typing of values. When the clock control has keyboard focus, pressing the Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow keys has the same effect as clicking the up and down arrows.  
You can make a clock control inactive, so that it displays time and date values without allowing the user to change them.
