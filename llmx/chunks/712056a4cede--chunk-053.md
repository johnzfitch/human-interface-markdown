Conceptually, the Keyboard and Mouse interfaces exist as overlapping spheres, with many operations, such as typing text, in common. They differ in how the non-mouse user performs the various pointing-and-choosing operations:  
- Choosing from a menu: pressing Escape takes the user to the menu, the cursor keys moves around the menu, Return accepts the current item, and Escape cancels. See: "The menu bar".

- Moving and sizing a window: Open-Apple-D for drag redefines the cursor keys to move the window; Open-Apple-G for grow redefines the cursor keys to grow or shrink the window. See: "Moving a Window" and "Changing the size of a Window".
- Selecting text: Open-Apple-M for mark begins a text-selection mode. Moving the cursor keys marks the text, Return accepts, Escape cancels. See: "Selecting Text".
- Clicking on controls: Solid-Apple, by itself, acts as a mouse button to click on buttons, check boxes, and radio buttons. See: "Controls"
- Moving the insertion point: Pressing the cursor keys moves the insertion point. See: "Selecting".  
As much keyboard support as is practical has been installed within the various mouse toolkits; where you must provide your own, follow the direction and philosophy of these guidelines and the toolkits themselves. When using a toolkit-based application, the keyboard user can directly emulate a mouse by holding down the Open-Apple key and pressing, then releasing Solid-Apple. The cursor keys then affect the mouse cursor so the user can move around the display, using Solid-Apple as the mouse button to click, press, or drag. When the Open-Apple key is released, mouse emulation is terminated.  
The mouseless mouse is included as a safety net should a developer fail to discover in testing that there is a necessary feature that the keyboard user cannot get to without a mouse. It is also allows for rather flashy live demonstrations of your software's independence of the mouse. It is not intended as a substitute for the proper design of a keyboard-only interface: it was designed for ease of learning rather than ease of use, and to lower memory and documentation requirements.
