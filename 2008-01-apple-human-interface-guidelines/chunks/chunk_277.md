<span id="page-311-1"></span>The **stepper control** (also known as little arrows) allows users to increment or decrement values. The control is usually used in conjunction with a text field that indicates the current value. The text field may or may not be editable. Figure 15-52 shows several examples of the stepper control.

The stepper control is available in Interface Builder. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the NSStepper class.
