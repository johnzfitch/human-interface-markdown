<!-- Chunk 22 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 428 -->
To increase the speed with which menu choices can be made in keyboard-intesive applications, a limited number of menu items may be chosen directly from the keyboard, without using the mouse.  
To invoke a menu choice from the keyboard, hold down either APPLE key while pressing another key that is associated with that choice. Only commands in menus whose titles are currently in the menu bar can be invoked in this way. If no command in the menu bar is associated with the key, a beep is sounded.  
The user learns the keys that invoke menu commands during normal system use because each menu item that can be invoked from the keyboard is tagged with an apple symbol and the legend of the associated key. To find out all the commands accesible from the keyboard, bring up each menu by dragging across the menu bar; each menu item that is tagged with an apple and keycap legend is also available from the keyboard.

There are eight APPLE key combinations that are universally associated with certain common commands:  
APPLE-Z: Cut APPLE-B: Bold
APPLE-X: Paste APPLE-I: Italic
APPLE-C: Copy APPLE-: Underline
APPLE-U: Undo APPLE-N: Normal  
The other printing keys can be associated with different commands in different folders, but any one key must have only one meaning within one folder. Consistency is encouraged betwen folders of an application, that is, if the same command name appears in two folders of the same application, then the same keystroke should invoke them. Furthermore, applications should avoid assigning the same keystroke to different commands in different folders when a mistake by the user would be dangerous or even likely.
