It is easy to say that the user is in charge of computer interactions. More difficult is to give the user the information he needs to make reasonable choices. Users should have more information than just the absolutely essential—that's what dialog boxes and alert boxes are for. For example, instead of just being told that a particular action is not possible, the user should have a brief explanation why. Instead of just performing a necessary activity, the system should describe it and request the user's acknowledgement (through an OK box).
