<!-- Chunk 23 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 262 -->
Sometimes just choosing a menu item isn't enough. When a further parameter needs to be typed in, a white band the full width of the screen and of variable height extends down below the menu bar, prompts for the parameter, and provides a place for it to be echoed as it is typed. This box is called the Dialog Box, and it is a little akin to a system console terminal.  
The Dialog Box is also provides a place for the system or an application to put up prompts, interactive dialog, error messages, etc. without writing all over the user's document or changing the active folder. Applications may grow and shrink the dialog box vertically as needed, or just leave it up as a fixed size. The Dialog Box, unlike the Menu Bar, may be overlapped by a folder; if the dialog box obscures a folder, pressing the mouse button in that folder will bring it to the top. Pressing inside the Dialog Box when it is obscurred will bring it back to the top without changing the active folder. When necessary, an application may even put a scroll bar on the dialog box.
