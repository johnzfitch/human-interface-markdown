#### Special visual features

In addition to the way menu items are name and grouped, menus have other features that provide added information:

- An ellipsis (...) after <sup>a</sup> menu item means that after the item is chosen, the user will be asked for more information before the operation is carried out. Usually, the user must fill in <sup>a</sup> dialog box and click an OK button or its equivalent. Don't use the ellipsis when the dialog box that will appear is merely <sup>a</sup> confirmation or warning (for example, "Save changes before quitting?").
- D Check marks indicate attributes that are currently in effect.
- Any menu items that the user can't choose at the moment are displayed in gray letters. If the user moves the pointer over a dimmed item, that item isn't highlighted.
- a If an item has a keyboard equivalent (if it can be chosen from the keyboard as well as from <sup>a</sup> menu), its name in the menu is followed by the Apple (or cloverleaf) symbol and a character. To choose an item this way, the user presses the character key while holding down the Apple (Command) key.

Figure 3-22 illustrates these features.

Several other menu features are also supported:

- D In the Style menu only, menu items can be shown in Bold, Italic, Outline, Underline, or Shadow, to illustrate the text styles themselves.
- A menu item can be preceded by <sup>a</sup> special character such as V or (to indicate which item is in effect). Icons can also appear in menus, but because of their size they require two menu lines.
- D Applications can have special kinds of menus for special situations. A pull-down menu can even be <sup>a</sup> palette that can be "torn off the menu bar and moved around the screen (Figure 3-23). See "Palettes" later in this chapter.
