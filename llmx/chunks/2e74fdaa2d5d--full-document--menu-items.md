#### Menu items

Menu items should be either verbs or adjectives. Use verbs (or verb phrases) to show the user what can be *done*—Copy, Find, and Show Page, for example. Use adjectives (or adjective phrases) to let the user specify an attribute of a selected object—Chicago [font], Underline, and Double Space, for example. Adjectives in menus *imply* actions—think of "Chicago" as shorthand for "*change* the selected text to Chicago font." Menu items usually apply to the current selection, although some may apply to the whole document or window.

When you're designing an application program, don't assume that *everything* has to be done through menus. Menus are often the best method, but sometimes it's more appropriate for an operation to take place as a result of direct user manipulation of a graphic object on the screen, such as a control or icon. Alternatively, a single menu item can start to execute complicated instructions by bringing up a dialog box for the user to fill in.
