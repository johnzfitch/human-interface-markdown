Use a segmented control when you want to offer the user a few closely related choices that affect a selected object. You can also use a segmented control to change views or panes in a window. Note that although a segmented control used as a view-changer looks similar to a tab view control, it does not behave the same: A segmented control is not attached to the panes, whereas a tab view control is attached to them. See ["Tab](#page-328-0) [Views"](#page-328-0) (page 329) for more information about tab views.  
If you need to provide a way for users to add and delete objects in a source list or other split view, don't use a segmented control that contains the plus and minus symbols. Instead, if you need to put an add-delete control in a bottom bar, use a rectangular-style toolbar control (described in ["Rectangular-Style](#page-249-0) Toolbar [Controls"](#page-249-0) (page 250)). If you need to put an add-delete control in the window body, use a gradient button (described in ["Gradient](#page-264-0) Buttons" (page 265)). Also, you don't need to create the plus and minusiconsfor these controls, because Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides these and many other icons for your use (see ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) Images" (page 151) for more information).
