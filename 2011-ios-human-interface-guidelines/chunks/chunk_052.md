The top of the screen is most visible to people, because they tend to interact with the device by holding the device in the following ways:  
- In their nondominant hand (or laying it on a surface), and gesturing with a finger of the dominant hand
- In one hand, and gesturing with the thumb of the same hand
- Between their hands, and gesturing with both thumbs  
**Put the most frequently used (usually higher level) information near the top,** where it is most visible and easy to reach. As the user scans the screen from top to bottom, the information displayed should progress from general to specific and from high level to low level.  
<span id="page-47-2"></span>For example, in a game, the most important action can take place in the top half of the screen. This leaves the bottom half of the screen forsupplementary information and for controls users can tap without obscuring their view.
