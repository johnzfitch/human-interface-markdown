The size and layout of checkboxes and radio buttons are identical. The square or circle itself is 12 pixels high and 12 pixels wide. For both radio button and checkbox controls, the Mac OS Toolbox automatically provides for the correct positioning of each control in relation to its text label. Built into the control are 5 pixels of space between the visible square or circle and the text label of the control, assuming a capital M. The bottom of the square is 2 pixels below the baseline of standard 12-point Chicago text. These dimensions are fixed attributes of the control; you do not have to define them nor can you change them. [Figure 3-21](#page-75-0) illustrates these dimensions.

The standard height of an entire checkbox or radio button control (the clickable region) is 18 pixels. Figure 3-22 shows the height of checkboxes.

The minimum visible vertical spacing between checkboxes or radio buttons should be 6 pixels. This spacing occurs when you abut 18-pixel high controls, as shown in Figure 3-22.  
When you place radio buttons or checkboxes horizontally, leave a minimum of 12 pixels space between them. If possible, leave more than 12 pixels of space between these controls. Leave 5 pixels of space between any preceding text and the first button. [Figure 3-23](#page-76-0) shows the minimum horizontal spacing between radio buttons.

When you use an icon or picture in place of (or along with) a text title for a checkbox or a radio button, the amount of space you allow depends on the position of the icon or picture in relation to the button or checkbox:  
- Allow 4 pixels of space between the title and the control when the icon or picture is above the radio button or checkbox.
- Allow 5 pixels of space between the title and the control when the icon or picture is to the right or left of the radio button or checkbox.  
[Figure 3-24](#page-77-0) shows the correct placement of title icons with radio buttons or checkboxes.
