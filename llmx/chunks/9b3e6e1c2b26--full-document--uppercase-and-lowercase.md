#### Uppercase and lowercase

If text must be displayed in either uppercase or lowercase, the application should call the Transliterate routine (in the Script Manager) to perform the operation. The UprString routine in the Macintosh ROM is designed to be used by the File system and as such does not handle diacritical marks or non-Roman scripts correctly.
