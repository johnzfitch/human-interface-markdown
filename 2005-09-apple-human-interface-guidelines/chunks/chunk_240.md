Inspectors are utility windows that allow users to view the attributes of a selection. They also often provide ways to modify these attributes. Xcode, Keynote, and the Finder all make use of inspectors. Inspectors should update dynamically based on the current selection.  
You can provide both inspectors and Info windows in your application because in some cases it's more useful to have one window where context changes when another item is selected (inspector) and in other cases it's more useful to be able to see the attributes of more than one item at a time (Info window). Multiple inspector windows and Info windows can be open at the same time. For more information on Info windows, see "Info [Windows"](#page-196-0) (page 197).
