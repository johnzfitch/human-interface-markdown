# Highlighting and Selection

Most things—menu items, icons, buttons, and so forth—should highlight by reversing the white background with the colored or black bits when selected. (For example, if the item is red on a white background, it should highlight to white on a red background.) However, if multiple colors of *text* appear together, Color TextEdit allows the user to set the highlighting bar color to something other than black to highlight the text better. The default for the bar color is always black.
