One of the biggest differences between the iPhone OS environment and the computer environment is the window paradigm. With the exceptions of some modal views, users see a single application screen at a time on an iPhone OS–based device. iPhone applications can contain as many different screens as necessary, but users access and see them sequentially, never simultaneously.  
<span id="page-15-2"></span>If the desktop version of your application requires users to see several windows simultaneously, you need to decide if there's a different way users can accomplish the same task in a single screen or a sequence of screens. If not, you should focus your iPhone application on a single subtask of your computer application, instead of trying to replicate a wider feature set.
