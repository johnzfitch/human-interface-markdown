This section describes controls that visually group other controls in a window. When there is more than one logical collection of controls and information in a window, the use of grouping controls helps users distinguish between them.  
There are two types of grouping controls in Mac OS X: separators and group boxes. For help in deciding whether to use a group box or a separator, and for examples of layouts with them, see ["Grouping](#page-360-0) Controls in a [Window"](#page-360-0) (page 361).  
**Important:** The controls described in this section are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the window-frame areas. See ["Window-Frame](#page-254-1) Controls" (page 255) for controls designed specifically for use in the toolbar and bottom-bar areas in your window.
