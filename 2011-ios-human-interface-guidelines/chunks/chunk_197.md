If you have a web application or a website, you can provide a custom icon that users can display on their Home screens using the web clip feature. Users tap the icon to reach your web content in one easy step. You can create an icon that represents your website as a whole or an icon that represents a single webpage.  
If your web content is distinguished by a familiar image or recognizable color scheme, it makes sense to incorporate it in your icon. However, to ensure that your icon looks great on the device, you should also follow the guidelines in this section. (To learn how to add code to your web content to provide a custom icon, see *Safari Web Content Guide*.)  
For iPhone and iPod touch, create icons that measure:  
- 57 x 57 pixels
- 114 x 114 pixels (high resolution)  
For iPad, create an icon that measures:  
● 72 x 72 pixels  
Asit does with application icons, iOS automatically addssome visual effectsto your icon so that it coordinates with the built-in icons on the Home screen. Specifically, iOS adds:  
- Rounded corners
- Drop shadow
- Reflective shine  
For example, a simple 57 x 57 pixel webpage icon might look like this:

When your 57 x 57 pixel icon is displayed on an iPhone Home screen, iOS makes the icon look like this:

**Note:** You can preventthe addition of all effects by naming youricon apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png (this is available in iOS 2 and later).  
**Ensure your icon is eligible for the visual enhancements iOS adds (if you want them)**. You should produce an image in PNG format that:  
- Has 90° corners
- Does not have any shine or gloss
