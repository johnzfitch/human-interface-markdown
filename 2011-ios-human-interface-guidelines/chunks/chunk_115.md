You can use a popover to:  
- Display additional information or a list of items related to the focused (or selected) object.
- Display the contents of the left pane when a split view–based app is in portrait. If you do this, be sure to provide an appropriately titled button that displays the popover, preferably in a navigation bar or toolbar at the top of the screen.
- Display an action sheet that contains a short list of options that are closely related to something on the screen.  
**Avoid providing a "dismiss popover" button**. A popover should close automatically when its presence is no longer necessary. To determine when a popover's presence is no longer necessary, consider the following scenarios:  
● When a popover's only function is to provide a set of options or items that have an effect on the main view, it should close as soon as people make a choice. This behavior is very similar to that of a menu in a computer application. Note that this behavior also applies to a popover that contains only an action sheet: As soon as people tap a button in the action sheet, the popover should close.  
Occasionally, it can make sense to provide a popover that contains items that affect the main view, but that does *not* close when people make a choice. You might want to do thisif you implement an inspector in a popover, because people might want to make an additional choice or change the attributes of the current choice.  
A popover that provides menu or inspector functionality should close when people tap anywhere outside its bounds, including the control that reveals the popover. In a popover that provides a menu of choices, this gesture meansthat the user has decided not to make a choice (so the main view remains unaffected). In a popover that contains an action sheet, this gesture takes the place of tapping a Cancel button.  
● If a popover enables a task, it can be appropriate to display buttons that complete or cancel the task and simultaneously dismissthe popover. In general, popoversthat enable an editing task display a Done button and a Cancel button. These buttons help remind people that they're in an editing environment and allow them to explicitly keep or discard their input. When people tap either button, the popover should close.  
If it makes sense in your application, you can prevent people from closing such a popover when they tap outside its borders. This might be a good idea if it'simportant that people finish (or explicitly abandon) a task. Otherwise, you should save their input when they tap outside a popover's borders, just as you would if they tapped Done.  
**In general, save users' work when they tap outside a popover's borders**. Because a popover does not require an explicit dismissal, people might dismiss it mistakenly. You should discard their work only if they tap a Cancel button.  
**Ensure that the popover arrow points as directly as possible to the element that revealed it**. Doing this helps people remember where the popover came from and what task or object it's associated with.  
**Make sure people can use a popover without seeing the application content behind it**. A popover obscures the content behind it, and people cannot drag a popover to another location.  
**Ensure that only one popover is visible onscreen at a time**. You should not display more than one popover (or custom view designed to look and behave like a popover) at the same time. In particular, you should avoid displaying a cascade or hierarchy of popovers simultaneously, in which one popover emerges from another.  
**Don't display a modal view on top of a popover**. Except for an alert, nothing should display on top of a popover.  
**When possible, allow people to close one popover and open a new one with one tap**. This behavior is especially desirable when several different bar buttons each open a popover, because it prevents people from having to make extra taps.  
**Avoid making a popover too big**. A popover should not appear to take over the entire screen. Instead, it should be just big enough to display its contents and still point to the place it came from.  
Ideally, the width of a popover should be at least 320 points, but no greater than 600 points. The height of a popover is not constrained, so you can use it to display a long list of items. In general, though, you should try to avoid scrolling in a popover that enables a task or that presents an action sheet. Note that the system might adjust both the height and the width of a popover to ensure that it fits well on the screen.  
**Generally, use standard UI controls and views within a popover**. In general, popovers look best, and are easier for users to understand, when they contain standard controls and views.  
**Take care if you combine a customized background color or texture with standard controls and views**. Be sure the standard UI elements look good and are easy to read when they're seen on top of your custom background appearance.  
<span id="page-104-0"></span>**If appropriate, change a popover's size while it remains visible**. You might want to change a popover's size if you use it to display both a minimal and an expanded view of the same information. If you adjust the size of a popover while it's visible, you can choose to animate the change. Animating the change is usually a good idea because it avoids making people think that a new popover has replaced the old one.
