#### Check boxes and radio buttons  
Check boxes and radio buttons let the user choose among alternatives.  
Check boxes act like toggle switches (comparable to the text attributes in the Style menu). Use check boxes to indicate the state of an option that must be either off or on. The option is on if the box is checked; otherwise it's off. The check boxes appearing together in a given context are independent of each other—any number of them can be off or on. In Figure 19, check boxes 1 and 2 are on; if a user clicked box 3, all three boxes would be on.  
Radio buttons typically occur in groups. They're called radio buttons because they act like the buttons on a car radio. They're mutually exclusive—at any given time, exactly one button in the group is on. Clicking one button in a group turns off whichever button was on before. In Figure 19, radio button 2 is on; if a user clicked button 3, button 2 would go off.  
If more than one group of buttons is visible at one time, the groups must be made distinct from one another.  
Both check boxes and radio buttons are accompanied by text that identifies what each button does.
