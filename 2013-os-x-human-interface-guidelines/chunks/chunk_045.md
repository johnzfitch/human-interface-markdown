Animation can be one of the best ways to provide feedback and to clarify the results of the user's actions. For example, users understand exactly what the Duplicate command does because they can watch the document copy spring from the original.

Typically, animation is also one of the easiest parts of UI design to get wrong. Use the following guidelines to help you enhance your app with polished, useful animation.  
**Avoid gratuitous animation.** Animation that serves no purpose or is illogical quickly becomes tiresome and irritating to users. Be sure that the animation you add enhances the user's understanding of your app's functionality.  
**In general, avoid using animation as the focus of the user experience.** Unless you're developing a game in which animation plays a major role, you should use animation to subtly enhance the user experience. If you place too much focus on animation in your app, users are likely to become distracted from their task. The best animation helps users understand what's going on, without drawing attention to itself.  
**Use animation to clarify the consequences of user actions.** Showing users the results of an action before they commit to it helps them be sure of themselves and avoid mistakes. For example, items in the Dock move aside when users drag an object into the Dock area, showing where the new object will reside when they drop it.  
**Animate a window's transition to and from full screen.** It's a good idea to supply a smooth, high-quality animation to replace the default transition. Creating a custom animation is especially important if your window contains custom elements that might not be able to participate in the default transition. For example, if you display a secondary bar below the toolbar (such as a "favorites" bar), you need to make sure that this bar transitions along with the toolbar when the window goes full screen.  
**Use animation to enhance realism.** If you create custom elements that look like real, physical objects, be sure to animate their movements so that they respond realistically, too. For example, if the user can spin an object in the UI, a large or heavy object should appear to slow down quicker than a small or lightweight object. For more guidelines related to adding realism to your UI, see "Consider Adding [Physicality](#page-50-0) and Realism" (page 51).  
**Use animation when an object changes its properties.** Showing an object's transition from one state to another, instead of showing only the beginning and ending states, helps users understand what's happening and gives them a greater sense of control over the process.  
**Use animation when an action occurs so quickly, users can'ttrack it.** When it'simportant that users understand a connection or a process, animation can help them watch actions occur in a more human time frame. For example, when the user minimizes a window it doesn't just disappear from the desktop and reappear in the Dock; instead, it moves fluidly from the desktop to the Dock so that users know exactly where it went.  
**Avoid animating everything.** Although it's tempting to think that more animation results in great clarification and better feedback, it's not generally true. Most tasks and actions in an app are best performed quickly and with a minimum of fanfare.  
**Avoid animating routine actions supported by system-provided controls.** Users understand how common UI elements work, and they don't appreciate being forced to spend extra time watching unnecessary animation every time they click a button or switch tabs.
