Strive to make your application instantly understandable to people, because you can't assume that they have the time (or can spare the attention) to figure out how it works.  
**Make the main function of your application immediately apparent**. You can make it so by:  
- Minimizing the number of controls from which people have to choose
- Using standard controls and gestures appropriately and consistently so that they behave the way people expect
- Labeling controls clearly so that people understand exactly what they do  
**Be consistent with the usage paradigms of the built-in applications**. Users understand how to navigate a hierarchy of screens, edit list contents, and switch among application modes using the tab bar. Make it easy for people to use your application by reinforcing their experience.  
In the built-in Stopwatch function (part of the iPhone Clock application) users can see at a glance which button stops and starts the stopwatch and which button captures lap times.
