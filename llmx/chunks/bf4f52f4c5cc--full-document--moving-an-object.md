## **Moving an Object**

The user can drag a movable object by positioning the cursor over it, pressing the mouse button, and moving the mouse while the button is down. The object should move so that it remains aligned with the cursor on-screen. If the object is constrained within a particular area or track-as is a scroller knob, for example-it should remain as closely aligned with the cursor as possible.

The Application Kit contains support for moving objects between and within applications. It even changes the cursor to indicate whether the object is being moved, copied, or linked. See "Managing the Cursor," later in this chapter, for more information on changing the cursor.
