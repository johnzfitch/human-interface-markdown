#### **Document windows**

Because a document may contain more information than a window can display at one time, the window provides a view of a portion of a document. Document windows also provide a graphic representation of opening, closing, and other operations performed on documents. Windows are usually, but not necessarily, rectangles. Figure 3-3 shows a standard document window and its components.
