Multitasking allows people to switch quickly among recently used applications, because apps can be suspended in the background when they are quit. A suspended app can resume quickly because it does not have to reload its UI. People use the multitasking UI (shown here below the iPhone Calendar app) to choose a recently used app.

Thriving in a multitasking environment hinges on achieving a harmonious coexistence with other applications on the device. At a high level, this means that all applications should:  
- Handle interruptions or audio from other applications gracefully
- Stop and restart (that is, transition to and from the background) quickly and smoothly
- Behave responsibly when not in the foreground  
The following specific guidelines help your app succeed in the multitasking environment.  
**Be prepared for interruptions, and be ready to resume**. Multitasking increases the probability that a background application will interrupt your app. Other features, such as the presence of ads and faster application-switching, can also cause more frequent interruptions. The more quickly and precisely you can save the current state of your application, the faster people can relaunch it and continue from where they left off.  
**Make sure your UI can handle the double-high status bar**. The double-high status bar appears during events such as in-progress phone calls, audio recording, and tethering. In unprepared applications the extra height of this bar can cause layout problems. For example, the UI can become pushed down or covered. In a multitasking environment, it's especially important to be able to handle the double-high status bar properly because there are likely to be more applications that can cause it to appear. You can trigger the double-high status bar during testing to help you find and correct any views that don't handle it well. (To learn how to do this using iOS Simulator, see "Manipulating the Hardware" in *iOS Development Guide*.)

**Be ready to pause activities that require people's attention or active participation**. For example, if your application is a game or a media-viewing application, make sure your users don't miss any content or events when they switch away from your application. When people switch back to a game or media viewer, they want to continue the experience as if they'd never left it.  
**Ensure that your audio behaves appropriately**. Multitasking makes it more likely that other media activity is occurring while your application is running. It also makes it more likely that your audio will have to pause and resume to handle interruptions. Forspecific guidelinesthat help you make sure your audio meets people's expectations and coexists properly with other audio on the device, see ["Sound"](#page-79-0) (page 80).  
**Use local notifications sparingly**. An application can arrange for local notifications to be sent at specific times, whether the application is suspended, running in the background, or not running at all. For the best user experience, avoid pestering people with too many notifications, and follow the guidelines for creating notification content described in "Local and Push [Notifications"](#page-91-0) (page 92).  
**When appropriate, finish user-initiated tasks in the background**. When people initiate a task, they usually expect it to finish even if they switch away from your application. If your application is in the middle of performing a user-initiated task that does not require additional user interaction, you should complete it in the background before suspending.
