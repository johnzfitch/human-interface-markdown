The standard height of a pop-up menu button is 20 pixels. If you use the small system font, the height is 18 pixels.  
When placing pop-up menu buttons in a vertical orientation, leave a minimum distance of 6 pixels between the controls, as shown in [Figure 3-25](#page-78-0).

Place paired controls close together. Leave 4 pixels of space between an edit text field and its associated pop-up menu button, or between interrelated pop-up menus. This space between controls is not automatically provided for by the Mac OS Toolbox; it is your responsibility to allow for it in your layout design.
