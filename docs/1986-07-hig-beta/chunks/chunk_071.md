Compared to writing the actual code, localization can be easy and painless. If you pay attention early on to the details of localization, you'll ensure that international markets are available for your product in the future. You'll also allow English—speaking foreign users to buy the English version of your software and still be able to use it with their native languages. To create fully easily localized software, you must follow certain guidelines for the use of text, fonts, sorting and date/time display.  
Here are some tips to make your software more useful in cultures other than your own.  
- Make quoted strings that will have to be translated easy to find. No *text* the user sees should be in the program code itself. Storing all these words in resources will make translation easier.
- If your program relies on properties of the ASCII code table or uses data compression codes that assume a certain number of letters in the alphabet, remember that not all alphabets have the same numbers of characters. German, for example, has thirty characters, not just twenty-six.
- Don't assume that all languages have the same rules for punctuation, word order, and alphabetizing. In Spanish, questions both begin and end with a question mark. The roles of commas and periods in numbers is sometimes the reverse of what you may be used to—in some countries the number 3,546.98 is rendered 3.546,98. Use the Macintosh's international resources.
- Don't let your program rely on strings having particular lengths. After translation, nearly all strings will be either longer or shorter.
- Laws and customs vary. The elements of addresses don't always appear in the same order. In some countries, the postal zone code precedes the name of the city, in other countries it's the reverse. In some countries, postal zone codes contain letters as well as numbers. The rules for amortizing mortgages and calculating interest rates vary from country to country—even between Canada and the United States.
- Keyboards vary from country to country. Some characters appear on some keyboards and not on others. Keystrokes that are easily performed with one hand in your own country may require two hands in another. In France and Italy, for example, typing numerals requires pressing the Shift key.
- Units of measure and standard formats for time and date differ from country to country. For example, "characters per inch" is meaningless in the metric world—that is, almost everywhere. In some countries, the 24-hour clock prevails. Such culture-dependent information can be read  
from resources so that the application automatically works correctly in countries where those resources have been properly set up. Always use the Macintosh's international resources instead of coding such information directly into your program.  
• Mnemonic shortcuts that are valid in one language may not be in others. Make sure all such shortcuts are also in resources.
