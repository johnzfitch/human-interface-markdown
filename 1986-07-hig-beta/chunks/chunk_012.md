Users generally do things in two distinct steps. First, they select the object—a document, an application, a block of text—by clicking on it. Second, they select the operation to be performed on this object—print, open, cut, paste, etc. This noun—verb sequence implies action, where the computer plays the role of getting particular objects to perform according to the user's wishes.  
#### Immediate Feedback  
Since users are constantly in charge of their own actions, they require very direct and immediate feedback on particular actions. They need to know that a particular action is being performed or has been completed. For example, the user knows a particular document is opened when its window fills the screen. When an item is highlighted, the user knows that she has selected it. When a menu name is selected, the menu itself becomes visible. When the pointer is temporarily deactivated while a process is being completed, it turns into a watch to indicate that it will be some time before it is active again. When the user selects a paintbrush as a tool for drawing, the pointer changes into the shape of the paintbrush.
