<span id="page-21-3"></span>The Clear key has the same effect as the Delete command in the Edit menu: It removes the selection without putting it on the Clipboard. Not all keyboards have a Clear key, so don't require its use in your application.  
#### **Esc (Escape)**  
The Esc (Escape) key basically means "let me out of here." It has specific meanings in certain contexts. The user can press Esc in the following situations:  
- In a dialog, instead of clicking Cancel
- To stop an operation in progress (such as printing), instead of pressing Command-period  
- To cancel renaming a file or an item in a list
- To cancel a drag in progress  
<span id="page-22-3"></span>Pressing Esc should never cause the user to back out of an operation that would require extensive time or work to reenter. When the user presses Esc during a lengthy operation, display a confirmation dialog to be sure that the key wasn't pressed accidentally.
