<span id="page-96-5"></span><span id="page-96-4"></span>In the Macintosh interface, the standard pointing device isthe mouse. Users can substitute other devices—such as trackballs and stylus pens—that maintain the behavior of direct manipulation of objects on screen.  
Moving the mouse without pressing the mouse button moves the **pointer**, or cursor. The onscreen pointer can assume different shapes according to the context of the application and the pointer's position. For example, in a word processor, the pointer takes the I-beam shape while it's over the text and changes to an arrow when it's over a tools palette. Change the pointer'sshape *only* to provide information to the user about changesin the pointer'sfunction. More information on using pointers correctly can be found in ["Pointers"](#page-160-0) (page 161)  
Just *moving* the mouse changes only the pointer'slocation, and possibly itsshape. *Pressing* the mouse button indicates the intention to do something, and *releasing* the mouse button completes the action.  
<span id="page-96-2"></span>These guidelines apply to single-button mice and to the primary button of multi-button mice. Note that users can select which button of a multi-button mouse to designate as the primary button in Mouse preferences.
