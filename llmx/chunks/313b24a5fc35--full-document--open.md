## Open

Opens an existing document. A dialog box lets the user select which document. This dialog box shows a list of all the documents on the disk whose name is displayed that can be handled by the current application.

With Macintosh's Hierarchical File System (HFS), the user, when opening a document, can browse through all levels of folders, forward and backward. The Eject and Drive buttons allow the user to look at documents on another disk or to eject a disk. When no disk is available to look at or to eject, the Eject and Drive buttons are dimmed.
