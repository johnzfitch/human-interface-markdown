#### Save  
Lets the user save the active document to a disk, including any changes made to that document since the last time it was saved. The document remains open. Users appreciate seeing, at this point, a message telling them the document is indeed being saved.  
If the user chooses Save for a new untitled document (one the user hasn't named yet), the application presents the Save As dialog box (described next). This dialog box allows the user to name the document and choose where it will be saved before the application continues with the save. The active document remains active.  
If there's not enough room on the disk to save the document, the application says so. The application then suggests that the user can choose Save As instead, to save the document on another disk.
