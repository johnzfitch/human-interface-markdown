#### Scroll Bars

Scroll bars are used to change which part of a document view is shown in a window. Only the active window can be scrolled.

A scroll bar is a light gray rectangle having on each end an arrow in a square box. A window can have either a vertical scroll bar or a horizontal scroll bar, or both. Vertical scroll bars are on the right side of the associated window; horizontal scroll bars run along the bottom of the window. Inside the scroll bar is a white rectangle called the scroll box. The rest of the scroll bar is the gray area.

Figure 42. Vertical Scroll Bar

A scroll bar represents one dimension (either top to bottom or left to right) of the entire document. The scroll box represents the relative location, in the whole document, of the portion currently seen in the window. The insertion point is linked to the scroll box. If the user "moves" the document by clicking either a scroll arrow or in the gray area, the scroll box moves along with it. If the user drags the scroll box, the document "moves" along with it. If the document is no larger than the window, the scroll bars are inactive (the scrolling apparatus isn't shown in them). If the document window is inactive, the scroll bars aren't shown at all.

There are three ways to move the document under the window: by sequential scrolling, by "paging" windowful by windowful through the document, and by dragging the scroll box. To experience these first hand, try them out in an application such as MacWrite.
