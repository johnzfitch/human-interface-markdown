Commands in menus normally act on only one object. If a command needs more information before it can be performed, it presents a **dialog box** to gather the additional information from the user. The user can tell which commands will use a dialog box to get more information because these commands are followed by an ellipsis (...) in the menu.  
A dialog box is a rectangle that may contain text, controls, and icons. There should be some text in the box that indicates which command caused the dialog box to appear and what the function of the box is.  
The user sets controls and text fields in the dialog box to provide the needed information. When the application puts up the dialog box, it should set the controls to some default setting and fill in the text fields with default values, if possible. One of the text fields (the "first" field) should be highlighted, so that the user can change its value just by typing in the new value. If all the text fields are blank, there should be an insertion point in the first field.  
Editing text fields in a dialog box should conform to the guidelines detailed under "Editing Text."  
When the user is through editing an item,  
- Pressing the Tab key accepts the changes made to the item and selects the next field in sequence.
- Clicking in another item accepts the changes made to the previous item and selects the newly clicked item.  
Dialog boxes can be either modal or modeless.  
A modal dialog box is one that the user must explicitly dismiss before doing anything else, such as making a selection outside the dialog box or choosing a command. Figure 20 shows an example of a modal dialog box.

Because it restricts the user's freedom of action, you should use this type of dialog box only sparingly. In particular, the user can't choose a menu item while a modal dialog box is up and therefore can do only the simplest kinds of text editing. For these reasons, the main use of a modal dialog box is when it's important for the user to complete an operation before doing anything else.  
A modal dialog box usually has at least two buttons: OK and Cancel. OK dismisses the dialog box and performs the original command according to the information provided; it can be given a more descriptive name than OK: "Start printing," for example. Cancel dismisses the dialog box and cancels the original command. It should always be called Cancel.  
A dialog box can have other kinds of buttons as well. These may or may not dismiss the dialog box. The **default button** (the most likely choice in the current situation) is doubly outlined to call attention to it. In Figure 20, OK is the default button. The user can activate the default button simply by pressing Return or Enter on the keyboard. If there's no default button, Return and Enter have no effect and the user must click in one of the screen buttons.  
A special type of modal dialog box is one with no buttons. This type of box just informs the user of a situation without eliciting any response. It usually describe the progress of an ongoing operation, then disappears. Because it has no buttons, the user has no way to control or dismiss it. It must remain on the screen long enough for the user to read it.  
A modeless dialog box allows the user to perform other operations without dismissing the dialog box. Figure 21 shows an example of a modeless dialog box.

Figure 21 A modeless dialog box  
A modeless dialog box is dismissed by clicking in the close box or by choosing Close. The dialog box is also dismissed implicitly when the user chooses Quit. The application should remember the contents of the dialog box after it's dismissed, so that when it's opened again, it can be restored exactly as it was.  
Controls work the same way in modeless dialog boxes as in modal dialog boxes, except that buttons never dismiss the dialog box. In this context, the OK button means "go ahead and perform the operation, but leave the dialog box up," whereas the Cancel button usually terminates an ongoing operation.  
A modeless dialog box can also have text fields, which the user can edit with the commands in the Edit menu.  
#### **Alerts**  
Every user is likely at one time or another to do something that an application can't cope with. Applications also have to occasionally call the user's attention to things like a loose mouse connection or lack of paper in the printer. Alerts give applications a way to respond to problems in a consistent way, and in stages according to the severity of the problem, the user's expertise, and the particular history of the problem. The two kinds of alerts are beeps and alert boxes.  
#### **Beeps**  
Beeps are used for errors that are both minor and immediately obvious. For example, if the user tries to backspace past the left boundary of a text field, the application can simply beep instead of displaying an alert box. So that people who can't hear don't miss the message, all beeps should be accompanied by a flash (rapid inverting) of the menu bar.  
#### Aleri boxes  
An alert box resembles a modal dialog box. (See Figure 20.) The only way the user can respond is by clicking buttons or by pressing Enter or Return. Alert boxes might contain dials and buttons but usually not text fields, radio buttons, or check boxes.  
Note the recommended general arrangement of the elements. The icon is at the left, with the message text to the right. The buttons are below the message, with the default button, boldly outlined, at the lower right. The default is the likliest or safest response, and can be chosen by simply pressing Return or Enter.  
The way to be sure the default button is really "safe" is to word the message carefully. Messages in alert boxes must be brief, informative, and friendly without being misleading. If the alert is warning the user of a serious situation, it must be made clear—not hidden in a polite phrase. Messages should be phrased so that the user can easily answer them, and the wording should reflect the user's point of view, not the programmer's.

Figure 22 A typical alert box  
There are three classes of alert boxes, each for a different kind of situation and each having its own icon. (See Figure 23.)  
- Note. Provides information about situations that have no drastic effects. The user usually responds by pressing an OK button..
- Caution. Calls attention to an operation that may have undesirable results if it's allowed to continue. The user is given the choice to continue or not.
- Stop. Calls attention to a serious problem that requires that the user choose from alternative courses of action.

An application can define different responses for each of several stages of an alert, so that if the user persists in the same mistake, the application can issue increasingly helpful (or increasingly stern) messages. A typical sequence is for the first two consecutive occurrences of the mistake to result in a beep, and for subsequent occurrences to result in an alert box. This type of sequence is especially appropriate when the mistake is one that is probably accidental (for example, when the user chooses Cut when there's no text selection).  
How the buttons in an alert box are labeled depends on the nature of the box. If the box presents the user with a situation in which no alternative actions are available, the box has a single button that's labeled OK. Clicking this button means "I've read the alert." If the user is given alternatives, then typically the alert is phrased as a question that can be answered "yes" or "no." In this case, buttons labeled Yes and No are appropriate, although variations such as Save and Don't Save are also acceptable. OK and Cancel can be used, as long as their meanings aren't ambiguous.  
Generally, it's better to be polite than abrupt, even if it means lengthening the message. The role of the alert box is to be helpful and make constructive suggestions, not to give orders. But its focus is to help the user solve the problem, not to give an academic (no matter how interesting) description of the problem itself. It's important to phrase messages in alert boxes so that users aren't left guessing the real meaning.  
Make alert messages self-explanatory. The user should never have to refer to a manual or reference card to find out what an alert message means. Test your alert messages to be sure they tell the user exactly what needs to be done.  
The best way to make an alert message understandable is to think carefully through the error condition itself. Can the application handle this without an error? Is the error specific enough so that the user can fix the situation? What are the recommended solutions? Can the exact item causing the error be displayed in the alert message?
