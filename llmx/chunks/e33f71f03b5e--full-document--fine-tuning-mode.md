## **Fine-Tuning Mode**

If a document is large, small movements of the knob may correspond to sweeping changes in the display. This makes it difficult for users to adjust the display with precision when dragging the knob.

To make fine adjustments possible even for large documents, scrollers have a fine-tuning mode. When the user holds down the Alternate key and drags the knob, the knob and display move only slightly in response to large movements of the mouse. In this mode, the knob moves in the direction it's dragged, but doesn't stay with the cursor. It continues to reflect the position of the document being displayed.

Once the Alternate key is released, any subsequent dragging action will cause the knob to jump to the position of the cursor.
