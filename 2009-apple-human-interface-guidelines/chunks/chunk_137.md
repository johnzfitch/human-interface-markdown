Dragging items to the Trash results in moving the item from the source to the Trash. For example, dragging a textselection from a word-processing application and dropping it on the Trash icon (or in the Trash window) resultsin the text being deleted from the application and a clipping containing that text being created inside the Trash. Note that the item is moved, although it is dragged between two containers. This exception to the rules described earlier is appropriate because the user can undo the operation by dragging the clipping out of the Trash back to its original source; it is consistent with the principle of preventing accidental data loss.
