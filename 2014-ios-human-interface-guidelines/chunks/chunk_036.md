iOS apps tend to be graphically rich. Whether you're displaying users' photos or creating custom artwork, here are a few guidelines you should follow.  
**Support the Retina display.** Make sure that you supply @2x assets for all artwork and graphics in your app.  
**Display photos and graphics in their original aspect ratio, and don't scale them greater than 100%.** You don't want the artwork or graphics in your app to look skewed or too large. Let users choose whether they want to zoom images in or out.  
**Don't use images thatreplicate Apple products in your designs.** These symbols are copyrighted, and product designs can change frequently.
