## **Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor**

If the user enables one of the mouse buttons (with the Preferences application), it can be used to gain quick access to the main menu. When the user presses the enabled mouse button (except when the cursor is over an application icon), a copy of the main menu for the active application appears under the cursor. The copy stays on-screen until the mouse butten is released.

To begin, the cursor lies directly over the main menu's title bar. The user can drag down into the menu (and into its submenus) to choose a command. When the mouse button is released, the copy and any submenus disappear.

See "Left and Right Orientation" in Chapter 3, "User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse," for more information on enabling mouse buttons.
