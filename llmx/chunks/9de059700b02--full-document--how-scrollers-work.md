## **How Scrollers Work**

As illustrated below, a scroller has just three parts, a *bar,* a *knob,* and an optional set of *scroll buttons.* This figure shows a vertical scroller, which scrolls information up and down. A horizontal scroller scrolls from side to side.

If the material to be displayed is provided with scrollers, but happens, perhaps temporarily, to fit within the opening, then the knob and scroll buttons disappear, so the scroller looks like a plain gray strip. The strip indicates that the material will be scrollable, should it grow larger than the opening.
