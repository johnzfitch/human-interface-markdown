Sometimes, displaying icons in menus can help users recognize menu items and relate them to other items they know about. As with all icons and images, make sure that using symbols instead of text doesn't add confusion or ambiguity.  
**Don't use an icon without any text.** Even if you use an icon you think all users will recognize, it's best to reinforce the icon's meaning by including a textual menu item name.  
**Use only familiar icons.** Use an icon in a menu item to represent something the user can learn to associate with specific functionality in your app or to represent something recognizable from other parts of the system. For example, the Finder uses icons in the Go menu because users associate them with the icons they see in the Finder sidebar.

In another example, Safari uses the icons displayed by some webpages to help users make the connection between the webpage and the menu item for that webpage.

<span id="page-84-0"></span>**Avoid displaying an icon for every menu item.** If you include icons in your menus, include them only for menu items for which they add significant value. A menu that includes too many icons (or poorly designed ones) can appear cluttered and be hard to read.
