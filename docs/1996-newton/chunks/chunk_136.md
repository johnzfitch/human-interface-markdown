In some places users can't be restricted to multiple-choice input methods. They must be able to input their own text or shapes (pictures). The Newton interface includes several elements in which users can write text or draw pictures. Some of these interface elements recognize text from handwriting or printing, some recognize geometric shapes from line drawings, and one interface element recognizes both types of input. All of the interface elements that recognize text or shapes also recognize a common set of gestures with which users can correct and edit text and shapes.
