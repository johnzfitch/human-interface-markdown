Users appreciate apps that allow them to be in control and they generally dislike apps that wrest control away from them too often. One of the most common ways that apps take control away from users is by overusing modes that require users to follow a specific path.  
Occasionally, modality is unavoidable, such as when a serious condition arises that jeopardizes the user's data or when the user initiates a task that must be completed before they can continue interacting with the app or their content. It's also reasonable to use a mode that emulates a familiar real-life situation that isitself modal. For example, choosing different toolsin a graphics app resemblesthe real-life choice of physical drawing tools. And sometimes, providing a mode is an effective way to help the user focus on a task and avoid distractions. (Note that a full-screen window is a type of modal experience, but it is one that remains active when users switch away from it.) As you design the user experience of your app, follow the guidelines in this section so that users don't feel constrained by modality.  
**Think carefully about an app design that requires users to enter modes frequently.** In general, you don't want usersto experience your app as a series of disjointed tasks. You also want to avoid chopping up the user's workflow by requiring too-frequent transitions into and out of modes. As much as possible, reserve modes for small, self-contained tasks that users are likely to want to finish all at once.  
**Balance modelessness with the need for a distraction-free experience.** Sometimes, users appreciate an isolated, self-contained environment in which to accomplish a task. Your challenge is to provide a mode that's both discrete and full-featured. Users do not appreciate finding that they need to exit a mode to get information (or perform a subtask) that'srequired to accomplish the modal task. As much as possible, allow usersto perform tasks in a way that integrates with the rest of your app's functionality, and use a mode only when it provides value.  
**Clearly indicate the current mode.** If users can enter different modes in your app, make it easy for them to tell at a glance which mode they're in. For example, a graphics app might use different pointerstylesto indicate whether the user is currently in drawing, erasing, orselection mode. A segmented control can also show which mode the user is in; for example the View segmented control in the Finder toolbar indicates whether users are in icon, list, column, or Cover Flow view. And a popover offers a very strong visual indication of a self-contained task. (To learn more about using a popover in your app, see ["Popovers"](#page-204-0) (page 205).)  
<span id="page-37-0"></span>**Make modes easy to leave.** Users should not feel that they're trapped in a mode or that it takes effort to leave it. For example, you can enable a transient mode by using a popover, which can close automatically when users click outside of it. Be sure to save the user's work, in case they leave a mode without meaning to.
