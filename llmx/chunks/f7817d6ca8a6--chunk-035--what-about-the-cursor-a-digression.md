#### What About the Cursor? (a Digression)  
Traditional character—oriented command—line interfaces rely on a "cursor" to indicate the insertion point (the place on the display where the next character that is typed will appear). Because there is just one insertion point, one cursor is sufficient. The user uses arrow keys (sometimes called "cursor keys") to move the cursor around the screen.  
The desktop interface requires that the cursor's functions be divided between *two* screen elements. An "insertion point" shows where the next characters to be typed will appear. In addition, the "pointer" (logically attached to the mouse or other pointing device) shows where the insertion point should be moved to.  
In a graphical interface, pointing at objects then selecting operations from a menu replaces the "command line." The screen is full of objects the user can point to; using arrow keys to move a cursor is an unsatisfactory way to point to them.
