#### Tab

In text-oriented applications, the Tab key is used to move the insertion point to the next tab stop. In other contexts, Tab is a signal to proceed: it signals movement to the next item in a sequence, as shown in Figure 10-8. Pressing Tab often causes data to be entered before moving to the next item.
