<span id="page-260-5"></span><span id="page-260-2"></span>**Progress indicators** inform users about the status of lengthy operations. (For guidelines on when to provide such information, see "Feedback and [Communication"](#page-41-2) (page 42).) There are three types of progress indicators:  
- <span id="page-260-3"></span>■ **Determinate progress bar:** Use when the full length of an operation can be determined and you can tell the user how much of the process has been completed. You could use a determinate progress indicator to show the progress of a file conversion, for example. See Figure 14-36.
- <span id="page-260-4"></span>■ **Indeterminate progress bar:** Use when the duration of a process can't be determined. You might use an indeterminate progress indicator to let the user know that the application is attempting a dial-up communication connection, for example, when there's no way to accurately determine how long it will take to complete. If an indeterminate process reaches a point where its duration can be determined, switch to a determinate progress indicator. See Figure 14-36.
- <span id="page-260-1"></span>■ **Asynchronous progress indicator**: Usewhen space is veryconstrained. These indicators are best used for asynchronous events that take place in the background, such as retrieving messages from a server. Don't use the asynchronous progress indicator in operations that start out indeterminate but could become determinate. See Figure 14-37.  
In a determinate progress bar, the "fill" moves from left to right and should fill in completely before it is dismissed. An indeterminate progress bar displays a spinning striped cylinder to indicate an ongoing process.  
Determinate progress bars should associate progress with time. A progress bar that becomes 90 percent complete in 5 seconds but takes 5 minutes for the remaining 10 percent, for example, would be annoying and lead users to think that something is wrong.  
Progress bars typically appear within a progress dialog. When the process being performed can be interrupted, the progress dialog should contain a Cancel button (and support the Esc key). If interrupting the process will result in possible side effects, the button should say Stop instead of Cancel.  
In addition to appearing in dialogs, the asynchronous progress indicator often appears in the main application window or a document window. Asynchronous progress indicators are generally visible only when an indeterminate operation is in progress.  
Be sure to locate progress indicators in consistent locations in yourwindows and dialogs.For example, the Mail application always displays the asynchronous progress indicator in the far right of the To field as it finds and displays email addresses that match what the user types. Choosing a consistent location for progress indicators allows users to quickly check a familiar place for the status of an operation. See ["Consistency"](#page-43-0)(page 44) for more information on the importance of providingconsistency in your application.

**Carbon:** All progress indicators are available in Interface Builder. You can create progress bars programmatically with the function CreateProgressBarControl and asynchronous progress indicators with CreateChasingArrowsControl.  
**Cocoa:** All progress indicators are available in Interface Builder. All progress indicators can be displayed with the NSProgressIndicator class. See *Progress Indicators* in Cocoa User Experience Documentation.
