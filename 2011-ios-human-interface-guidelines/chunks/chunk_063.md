**Think like a newspaper editor, and strive to convey information in a condensed, headline style**. When your UI text isshort and direct, users can absorb it quickly and easily. Identify the most important information, express it concisely, and display it prominently so that people don't have to read too many words to find what they're looking for or to figure out what to do next.  
**Give controls shortlabels, or use well-understood symbols,**so that people can tell what they do at a glance. When appropriate, use the built-in buttons and icons described in ["System-Provided](#page-134-0) Buttons and Icons" (page 135); for guidelines on designing your own icons,see "Iconsfor [Navigation](#page-148-0) Bars, Toolbars, and Tab Bars" (page 149).
