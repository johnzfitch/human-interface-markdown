As a general rule, arrow keys are used to move the insertion point and (when used in tandem with the Shift key) to expand or shrink selections. These guidelines apply both to moving the insertion point and to making selections. In a graphics application, the arrow keys can be used for fine movement (one pixel per keystroke) ot selected objects, after the mouse has been used for larger movements. Arrow keys are never used to duplicate the function of the scroll bars or to move the mouse pointer.  
The arrow keys do not replace the pointing device. They can be used as a shortcut way to move the insertion point, and, under some circumstances, to make selections. The guidelines in this section are the minimum guidelines for arrow keys; you can expand on them if you need to, keeping in mind the spirit of these guidelines.  
An application should use the arrow keys only when appropriate to the task. Applications that deal with text or arrays (word processors, spreadsheets, and data bases, for example) have an insertion point. This insertion point could be moved both by the mouse and by the arrow keys.  
Graphics applications have no insertion point. If a graphics application uses arrow keys, it should be only to move the selected object by the smallest possible increment (one pixel or one grid unit). Graphics applications should never use arrow keys to change a selection or use modifier keys to multiply the effect of arrow keys.
