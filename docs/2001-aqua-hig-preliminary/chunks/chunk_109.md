Modifier keys alter the way other keystrokes or mouse clicks are interpreted. You should use these keys—Shift, Caps Lock, Option, Command, and Control consistently as described here.  
#### <span id="page-129-10"></span><span id="page-129-2"></span>Shift  
When pressed at the same time as a character key, the Shift key produces the uppercase alphabetic letter or the upper symbol on the key.  
The Shift key is also used with the mouse for extending a selection or for constraining movements in graphics applications. For example, in some applications pressing Shift while using a rectangle tool draws squares.  
#### <span id="page-129-5"></span><span id="page-129-3"></span>Caps Lock  
When activated, the Caps Lock key has the same effect on alphabetic keys as the Shift key, but it has no effect on keys whose upper- and lowercase characters are different, such as the number keys. In other words, even if the Caps Lock key is down, the user must press Shift to type the upper character on a nonalphabetic key.  
#### <span id="page-129-9"></span><span id="page-129-4"></span>Option  
When used with other keys, the Option key produces special symbols. The Key Caps application shows which keys generate each symbol.  
The Option key can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. For example, in some applications pressing Option while dragging an object makes a copy of the object.  
#### <span id="page-130-6"></span><span id="page-130-0"></span>Command  
On most keyboards, the Command key is labeled with a propeller ( ) symbol and an Apple logo (). Pressing the Command key at the same time as a character key tells the application to interpret the key as a command rather than a character. These command shortcuts are described in ["Keyboard Equivalents" \(page 138\)](#page-137-2).  
In some applications, the Command key is used with other keys to provide special functions or shortcuts. It can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag.  
#### <span id="page-130-7"></span><span id="page-130-1"></span>Control  
<span id="page-130-8"></span>The Control key is used to modify the functions of other keys, with terminal-emulation programs for Control-key sequences, and, with a mouse click, to display contextual menus (see ["Contextual Menus" \(page 47\)](#page-46-1)). Cocoa developers should also consider additional behaviors, as described in the text defaults and binding document, available in the programming topics section on http:// developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/Cocoa.
