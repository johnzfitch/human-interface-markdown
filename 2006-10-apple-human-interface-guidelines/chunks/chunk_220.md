Every document, application, and utility window should have, at a minimum:  
- A title bar. Even if thewindowdoes not have an actual title (a tools palette, for example), it should have a title bar so that users can move the window.
- A close button, so that the user has a consistent way to dismiss it.  
In addition, a standard document window has the following attributes that an application or utility window might not have:  
- <span id="page-178-2"></span>■ Horizontal or vertical scroll bars, or both (if not all the window's contents are visible)
- Minimize and zoom buttons
- A proxy icon (after a document has been saved)
- The title of the document
- A resize control
- A toolbar control  
<span id="page-178-1"></span>These elements are shown in their proper placements in Figure 13-2 (to see the proper placement of a horizontal scroll bar, see [Figure](#page-199-1) 13-22 (page 200)).
