The following steps provide guidelines that you can use when conducting a simple user observation. Remember, this test is not designed as an experiment, so you will not get quantitative data that can be statistically analyzed. You can, however, see where people have difficulty using your product, and you can then use that information to improve your product.  
Most of these steps include some explanatory text that contains sample statements that you can read to the participant. Feel free to modify the statements to suit your product and the situation.  
#### **1. Introduce yourself and describe the purpose of the observation (in very general terms). Most of the time, you shouldn't mention what you'll be observing.**  
Set the participant at ease by stressing that you're trying to find problems in the product. For example, you could say something like this:  
- <sup>n</sup> "You're helping us by trying out this product in its early stages."
- <sup>n</sup> "We're looking for places where the product may be difficult to use."
- <sup>n</sup> "If you have trouble with some of the tasks, *it's the product's fault,* not yours. Don't feel bad; that's exactly what we're looking for."
- <sup>n</sup> "If we can locate the trouble spots, then we can go back and improve the product."
- <sup>n</sup> "Remember, we're testing the product, not you."  
#### **2. Tell the participant that it's OK to quit at any time.**  
Never leave this step out. Make sure you inform participants that they can quit at any time if they find themselves becoming uncomfortable. Participants shouldn't feel like they're locked into completing tasks. Say something like this:  
<sup>n</sup> "Although I don't know of any reason for this to happen, if you should become uncomfortable or find this test objectionable in any way, you are free to quit at any time."  
#### **3. Talk about the equipment in the room.**  
Explain the purpose of each piece of equipment (hardware, software, video camera, tape recorder, microphones, and so forth) and how it will be used in the test.  
#### **4. Explain how to think aloud.**  
Ask participants to think aloud during the observation, saying what comes to mind as they work. By listening to participants think and plan, you'll be able to examine their expectations for your product as well as their intentions and their problem-solving strategies. You'll find that listening to users as they work provides you with an enormous amount of useful information that you can get in no other way.  
Some people feel awkward or self-conscious about thinking aloud. Explain why you want participants to think aloud and demonstrate how to do it. For example, you could say something like this:  
- <sup>n</sup> "We have found that we get a great deal of information from these informal tests if we ask people to think aloud as they work through the exercises."
- <sup>n</sup> "It may be a bit awkward at first, but it's really very easy once you get used to it. All you have to do is speak your thoughts as you work. If you forget to think aloud, I'll remind you to keep talking. Would you like me to demonstrate?"  
#### **5. Explain that you will not provide help.**  
It is very important that you allow participants to work with your product without any interference or extra help. This is the best way to see how people really interact with the product. For example, if you see a participant begin to have difficulty and you immediately provide an answer, you will lose the most valuable information you can gain from user observation—where users have trouble and how they figure out what to do.  
Of course, there may be situations in which you will have to step in and provide assistance, but you should decide what those situations will be before you begin testing. For example, you may decide that you will allow someone to struggle for at least three minutes before you provide assistance. Or you may decide that there is a distinct set of problems on which you will provide help. However, if a participant becomes very frustrated, it's better to intervene than have the participant give up completely.  
As a rule of thumb, try not to give your test participants any more information than the true users of your product will have. Here are some things you can say to the participant:  
- <sup>n</sup> "As you're working through the exercises, I won't be able to provide help or answer questions. This is because we want to create the most realistic situation possible."
- <sup>n</sup> "Even though I won't be able to answer your questions, please ask them anyway. It's very important that I capture all your questions and comments. When you've finished all the exercises, I'll answer any questions you still have."  
#### **6. Describe in general terms what the participant will be doing.**  
Explain what all the materials are (such as the set of tasks, disks, and a questionnaire) and the sequence in which the participant will use them. Give the participant written instructions for the tasks.  
If you need to demonstrate your product before the user observation begins, be sure you don't demonstrate something you're trying to test. For example, if you want to know whether users can figure out how to use certain tools, don't show them how to use the tools before the session. Don't demonstrate what you want to find out. For example, rather than showing the participant what the final design outcome looks like and asking an opinion, you can show before and after screen shots and ask what the participant observes about each one.  
#### **7. Ask if there are any questions before you start; then begin the observation.**  
#### **8. During the observation, remember several pointers:**  
- <sup>n</sup> Stay alert. It's very easy to let your mind wander when you're in the seventh hour of running subjects. A great deal of the information you can obtain is subtle.
- <sup>n</sup> Ask questions or prompt the participant. Make sure you have a tester protocol that spells out how frequently you prompt and what you say. Your interruptions shouldn't be frequent, but when a participant is hesitating or saying, "Hmmm," ask what the participant is thinking about.
- <sup>n</sup> Be patient; it is very easy to become impatient when someone is taking a long time. The participant is doing you a favor and is probably somewhat nervous. Anything you can do to alleviate the participant's insecurities and put the participant at ease will provide you with much richer data.
