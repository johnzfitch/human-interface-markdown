Use for confirmation questions and choosing among three alternatives or fewer. This is the horizontal version of the scheme used on menus.  
Is the above information correct? <YES> no
Do you want to delete the old file? <NO> yes
Select fill-pattern for printed graph: Cross-hatch <DOTS>
Solid  
In forty column mode (shown), the standard (default) selection is bracketed and uppercased. In  $8\emptyset$ -column mode, it is displayed in inverse.  
Pressing either Y or N on a confirmation question moves the pointer (highlighting) to that word, Yes or No. Pressing Return then accepts the selection. In any selection set where each word starts with a unique letter, allow the user to type that letter. Do not allow wrapping: if the user is on the left-most answer, require her to use the Right-Arrow key to get to the right-most answer. The reason for this seemingly unfriendly rule will be made clear below.
