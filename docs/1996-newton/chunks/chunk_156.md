There are several steps involved in sending an item from an application through the Out Box to an output device. First, a user chooses a routing action from an Action picker. Next, the user supplies routing information in a routing slip provided by the transport that performs the chosen routing action. Then the system places the item in the Out Box. Eventually, a transport transfers waiting items in the Out Box to the proper output devices. For example, a user might choose Print from an Action picker in the Notepad application, and in the Print routing slip might choose a printer that's not available. Later, the user would connect the printer, and the print transport would send the waiting print item to the printer.  
This section describes how a user sends data items from an application with an Action picker. Alternative routing methods are covered in ["Routing](#page-239-0)  [Alternatives" on page 7-34.](#page-239-0)
