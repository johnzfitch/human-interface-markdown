#### Caps Lock

The Caps Lock key latches in the down position when pressed and releases when pressed again. (On PowerBook computers this key is a soft switch, so it doesn't latch.) Note that the Caps Lock key operates for Roman languages only; in other words, it works as described in this section for languages that include uppercase and lowercase letters. When down, it gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys. Caps Lock has the same effect on alphabetic keys that the Shift key has, but Caps Lock has no effect on any other keys. In other words, even when Caps Lock is down, the user must press the Shift key to produce the upper characters (#, ?, and so on) on the nonalphabetic keys.
