### Needs:

- 1. The prompting and documentation needs to be tutorial: the user must be guided into finding the necessary information to enter into the program, carrying out the kind of explorations with the program that will be most beneficial, and then suggest where the user should go from here.
- Clear content verification and alert messages. "Unlikely" data should be confirmed by user. Help should be aimed toward problems in understanding the subject of taxes.
- 3. Appearance and use of accounting jargon. Non-professionals will be using this package. The vocabulary used on the display and in printed reports should be non-intimidating and not filled with accounting jargon.
- 4. User will probably only use the program a few times per year. There must be a minimum learning curve, even at the expense of reduced power and facility. A menu-driven format should be considered.
- 5. The user has to be asked for a lot of pre-computed figures: use an expression-evaluator input to allow them to add, subtract, multiply, and divide during input.

The "research" quoted in the above examples is ficticious — do not start writing a tax-planner based on it. (The rest of the examples in this book are real.)

Carrying out an early investigation such as the ones above requires a minimum of time and can save you man-months of work later on. The reports need not be works of art; it is only important that every member of the design team has a clear picture of who the audience for this product will be. The user profile should be included in your Market Requirments Document, along with more prosiac information on market-shares, product penetration, competitive analysis.

If you have a marketing department, these reports should be their responsibility. They should carry out surveys, conduct focus groups, and otherwise collect good, solid information to answer the above questions. Then and only then will you be in a position to create a design responsive to the needs of the market.

Once the abstract report is done, you can develop a good mental image of the target audience by creating characters with names, occupations, family-lives, and dreams who collectively embody the breadth and depth of the audience. You may "make up" people who don't exist, or you can build composites out of people you know. This exercise gives people who have trouble holding on to abstract mental images a concrete, "living" representation of the users. It ensures that everyone on the design team is clear about who the users are, what they need, and what their expectations will be. In short, it gives everyone a stable, consistent focus. Even if you are a sole designer/programmer, you will find this to be a useful dicipline in forcing you to think all the way through the abilities and needs of the user. As the project goes along, you will replace your imaginary users with real ones, the subjects of your testing program.
