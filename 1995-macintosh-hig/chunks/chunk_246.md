The Command key is labeled with a propeller (x) symbol and, on some keyboards, an Apple symbol (K) as well. Pressing a character key while holding down the Command key usually tells the application to interpret the key as a command, not as a character. These combinations are called *keyboard equivalents*, as described in Chapter 4, "Menus," in the section "Keyboard Equivalents" on page 128.  
In some applications, the Command key is used with other keys to provide special functions or shortcuts. For example, pressing Command-Shift-3 on a Macintosh saves a snapshot of the current screen on disk. The Command key can also be used in conjunction with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag.  
#### Control 10  
The Control key is used with terminal-emulation programs for Control-key sequences. For all other applications, it is reserved for shortcut key sequences that the user defines using a macro-key facility.
