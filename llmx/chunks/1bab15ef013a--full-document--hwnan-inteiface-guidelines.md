## *Hwnan Inteiface Guidelines*

If the left or right end of a text selection is a word, follow these rules at that end, regardless of whether there's a word at the other end.

This feature should be used only if the application supports the full defmition of a word (as detailed in "Selecting Words"), rather than the defmition of a word as "anything between two spaces." These rules apply to any selection that's one or more whole words, whether it was chosen with a double click or as a range selection.
