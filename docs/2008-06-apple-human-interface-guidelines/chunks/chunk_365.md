Use an Action pop-up menu when you want to provide a visible shortcut to a handful of useful commands. Although contextual menus also provide shortcuts to a small number of commands, the fact that they are hidden makes them difficult for new users to discover and for all users to remember. (You can learn more about contextual menusin ["Contextual](#page-183-0) Menus" (page 184).) If you are thinking of providing (or already provide) an application-wide contextual menu, you might choose to replace it with an Action menu control in the toolbar.  
<span id="page-284-0"></span>You can also use an Action menu at the bottom of a list view or source list to provide commands that apply to items in the list. For example, Mail provides an Action menu at the bottom of its source list (shown in Figure 15-34). This Action menu contains commands that act on the account or mailbox selected in the source list.  
**Figure 15-34** An Action menu can be below a list view or source list

Avoid placing an Action menu control anywhere else in the body of a window. Contextual menus appear when the user selects an object in a window and Control-clicks (or clicks the right button of a properly configured two-button mouse). Because such an object might appear anywhere in a window, there's no reasonable, consistent location for an Action menu control that contains the commands specific to that object.
