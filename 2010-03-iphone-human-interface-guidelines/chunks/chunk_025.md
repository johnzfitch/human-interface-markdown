With iPhone OS, you can create an application that combines features of native applications and webpages. A **hybrid application** is a native iPhone application that provides most of its structure and functionality through a web viewing area, but also tends to contain standard iPhone OS user interface elements.  
A hybrid application gives users accessto web content with an element called a web view (described in ["Web](#page-103-0) [Views"](#page-103-0) (page 104)). Precisely how you use a web view in your application is up to you, but it's important to avoid giving users the impression that your application is merely a mini web browser. A hybrid application should behave and appear like a native iPhone application; it should not draw attention to the fact that it depends upon web sources.
