## **Alternate-Arrow Combinations**

Modified by the Alternate key, the arrow keys extend the current selection by one character or one line at a time. Users choose which edge of the selection to modify by the arrow key they press first.

When pressed first, the left arrow key moves the beginning of the current selection one character to the left (toward the beginning of the document). Subsequently, the left and right arrow keys both act on this same edge of the selection, moving it one character to the left or right. When pressed first, the right arrow key moves the end of the current selection one character to the right (toward the end of the document). Subsequently, the left and right arrow keys both act on the end of the seh~ction.

When pressed first, the up arrow key moves the beginning of the current selection up one line. Subsequently, the up and down arrow keys both move this same edge of the selection up and down a line. When pressed first, the down arrow key moves the end of the current selection down one line. Subsequently, the up and down arrow keys both move the end of the selection.
