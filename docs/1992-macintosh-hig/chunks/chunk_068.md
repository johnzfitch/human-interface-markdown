Progressive disclosure is one way to reduce the complexity of your designs. It allows you to present the most common choices to users while initially hiding more complex choices or additional information. Progressive disclosure helps you develop your interface so that it is easy for novice users to learn and includes the features and power that advanced users desire.  
For dialog boxes, you can implement progressive disclosure and thus reduce the complexity of your design by presenting only the most common options in the dialog box that appears initially on the screen. There are a couple of techniques you can implement to allow users to see more options. The most standard method of letting users see more choices is including a button named More Choices in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. When the user clicks the button, the dialog box expands to display more information and the button name changes to Fewer Choices. This method is very clear and predictable. People know how to use buttons, and the labels let people know right away that they have access to more information if they don't see what they're looking for. Figure 3-1 shows an example of a dialog box that implements this method of progressive disclosure.

If you include a More Choices button in a dialog box, it's best to extend the bottom of the window to accommodate the additional information. You could move a side of the window without causing too much change in the perceived stability of the window. However, avoid expanding the window symmetrically in all directions, because this behavior destroys the user's initial sense of the window being one object with some of it not visible. In general, it's best to keep all controls visible at all times. Also, if the larger state of the dialog box won't fit on the screen when the More Choices button is selected, move the dialog box the minimal amount necessary to make it fit on the screen. When the user clicks the Fewer Choices button, keep the dialog box in its new position; *don't* move it back to its original position on the screen.  
Figure 3-2 shows the directions in which a window or dialog box can grow to disclose more information.
