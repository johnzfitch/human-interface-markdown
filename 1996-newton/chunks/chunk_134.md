For a field that can have one or more of a few unchanging values, an application can use a set of checkboxes. Figure 6-5 shows a set of checkboxes.

A user can select any number of checkboxes by tapping them one by one. Tapping a checkbox that is already selected deselects it. A set of checkboxes always offers the same choices; the checkboxes never change dynamically depending on context. For a detailed description of checkboxes, see ["Checkboxes" on page 3-18](#page-111-0).
