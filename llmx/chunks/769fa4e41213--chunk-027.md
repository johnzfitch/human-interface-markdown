Most objects respond directly to manipulation with the mouse-a button is highlighted when pressed, a window comes forward when clicked, the knob of a slider moves when dragged. Direct manipulation is the most intuitive of the action paradigms and the one best suited for modifying the position and size of graphical objects. Windows, for example, are reordered, resized, and moved only through direct manipulation.  
By directly manipulating icons that represent documents, applications, mail messages, or other objects stored in the computer's memory, users can manipulate the objects the icons represent. For example, dragging an icon to a new location can change the position of a file in the file system's hierarchy.  
Even objects that use the targeted-action or modal-tool paradigm must respond to direct manipulation. For example, although buttons and menu commands can't be resized or moved, they nevertheless respond to direct manipulation as a way of giving feedback to the user. The response-mainly highlighting-shows that the user's action has successfully invoked one of the other paradigms.
