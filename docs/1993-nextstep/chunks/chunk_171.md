Actions should usually be started by either a menu command or a button. If necessary, you can even duplicate a menu command in a button. Even though text fields can start actions as the result of pressing Return, they should always have a button nearby that appears to be clicked when Return is pressed.  
Sometimes an action is relatively unimportant, and having a button for it takes up too much screen space. If the action isn't appropriate for a menu command for some reason, then another choice is to make it an item in a pull-down list.  
The following figure shows how the same action (printing) might appear as a menu command, button, and pull-down list item. (It normally appears as a menu command.)
