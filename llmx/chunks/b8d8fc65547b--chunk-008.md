<!-- Chunk 8 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 378 -->
A user interface is more than the wayan application looks on-screen. It's all the ways the application communicates with the user, and the user with the application. Beeps and other sounds are part of the user interface, as is the speed with which the application reacts to a mouse click. Still, the appearance of an application is a large part of its user interface. This chapter concentrates on how things look. How things act is covered in detail elsewhere.

The appearance of the NeXT STEP user interface is influenced by the following goals:  
- A look and feel that's consistent across applications
- A simple, elegant appearance that uses shading to give a three-dimensional effect
- A color scheme based on black, white, and gray
- The mouse as the primary input device

The figure above shows a typical NeXTSTEP screen (the *workspace*). In it, two applications have standard windows visible. (One of them also has a menu and a panel visible.) Other applications are running but have no visible presence besides an application icon and perhaps a miniaturized window (a miniwindow).  
Although many applications can run at once, only one is the *active application*—the application that accepts all user input such as typing and mouse clicks. The user can tell which application is active by checking the menu displayed in the upper left of the screen; this menu always belongs to the active application. In the figure above, Edit is the active application.
