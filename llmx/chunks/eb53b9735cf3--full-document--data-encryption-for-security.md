## Data Encryption for Security

When people share information with collaborative or networking products, users need to be able to trust that the information is secure from unwanted intruders. If data is stored on a communal file server or if it is sent across network connections, it may easily be inspected by unauthorized users. Therefore, you should encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords, in some way to prevent this intrusion from happening. Make sure you let the user know whether their data has been encrypted or not; they need to know if their data is protected from other users.
