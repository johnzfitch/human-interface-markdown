The user can select a range of some objects by following this procedure:  
- 1. The user positions the pointer at one corner of the range and presses the mouse button. This position is called the **anchor point** of the range.
- 2. Without releasing the mouse button, the user moves the pointer in any direction.  
As the pointer moves, visual feedback indicates the objects that would be selected if the mouse button is released.Fortext and arrays, the selected area is continuously highlighted.Forgraphics, a dotted rectangle expands or contracts to show the selected area. If appropriate, the view should scroll to allow extending the selection beyond a window.
