# The desktop

The primary unifying metaphor in the Apple Desktop Interface is the desktop itself. It provides a sense of apparent stability, remaining constant while its content changes.

Desktop icons are graphic representations of such things as disks, folders, applications, documents, and the trash can, as shown in Figure 11.

Icons contribute greatly to the clarity and attractiveness of an application. The use of icons in addition to (or instead of) words can also make it easier to translate programs into other languages, except where the icons have different meanings in different cultures. An item is easier to remember when it's represented by an icon with text than if it's represented by either an icon alone or text alone. Wherever an explanation or label is needed, consider using an icon.

The two basic subsystems of the desktop are the **windows** that provide flexible display of information, and the **menus** (including palettes) that make many operations immediately available.
