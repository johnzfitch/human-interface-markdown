#### *tiers*  
The sections of the screen list. Each tier is occupied by a different type of window, with spring-loaded windows such as pop-up lists in the frontmost tier, attention panels in the second tier, menus in the next two tiers, docked icons in the tier below menus, and floating panels below docked icons. All other windows are in the bottom tier.
