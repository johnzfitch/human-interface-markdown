If you make an icon in more than one size, maintain a close visual relationship among all sizes. Design the large icon first, and then adapt the design to the small icon. You can leave out inessential details in the small version of your icon, but it shouldn't look significantly different from the large version. [Figure 5-3](#page-158-0) shows examples of small and large icons.  
You can't design each variation of an icon in isolation. The large and small variants are incarnations of the same icon, so the basic design must work for all of them. Be flexible in adapting your design to all sizes. Icon design is an iterative process. During the design process, you may need to redesign one version of an icon when you find it doesn't translate well to another version.
