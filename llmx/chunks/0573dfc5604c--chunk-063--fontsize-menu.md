#### *FontSize Menu*  
Font sizes are measured in points. A point is a typographical unit of measure equivalent to In2 inch. The FontSize menu lists the nine standard sizes. The font size currently in effect is indicated with a check mark. (See Figure 34.) Not every font is available in all sizes; the sizes that are available for the selected font are shown outlined in the FontSize menu. A font can be scaled to the other sizes, but scaled fonts usually suffer in appearance on the screen and when printed by some kinds of printers.

Figure 34. FontSize Menu with Standard Font Sizes  
If there's insufficient room in the menu bar for the word FontSize, it can be abbreviated to Size. If there's insufficient room for both a Font menu and a Size menu, the sizes can be put at the end of the Style menu.
