Metaphors are building blocksin the user's mental model of a task or experience. A good way to take advantage of people's knowledge of the world is to use metaphors to convey objects and actions in your app. Metaphors that represent concrete, familiar ideas, can help users understand a new experience. For example, OS X uses the metaphor of file foldersforstoring documents, which meansthat people can organize their digital documents in a way that's analogous to the way they organize physical documents in file cabinets.  
Metaphors also extend to motions. People have strong expectations about the way objects can move and behave, and it's usually best to work with these expectations rather than against them. For example, users can be confused or disoriented by onscreen objects that appear to defy gravity or other natural laws without a good reason.  
Note that a metaphor can suggest how a particular element should appear or behave, but it shouldn't be used as an implementation specification. It's important to strike a balance between the experience suggested by a metaphor and the computer's ability to extend that experience for greater utility. For example, the number of items a user puts in the Trash is not limited to the number of items a physical wastebasket can hold.
