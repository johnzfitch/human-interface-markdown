Mac OS X applications can use these types of dialogs:  
- **Modeless**. A modeless dialog enables users to change settings in a dialog while still interacting with document windows; the Find window in many word processors is an example of a modeless dialog. Most modeless dialogs include only the close button title-bar control, because users usually interact briefly with a modeless dialog and then close it, they do not need to zoom it or minimize it.
- **Document modal**. A document-modal dialog prevents the user from doing anything else within a particular document. The user can switch to other documentsin the application and to other applications. Document-modal dialogs should be sheets, which are discussed in "Sheets [\(Document-Modal](#page-235-1) [Dialogs\)"](#page-235-1) (page 236).  
<span id="page-235-2"></span>● **Application modal**. An application-modal dialog prevents the user from doing anything else within the owner application, although the user can switch to another application. Most application-modal dialogs do not have the standard title bar controls (close, minimize, zoom); the user dismisses these dialogs by clicking a push button, such as OK or Cancel. Application-modal dialogs that appear as the result of the user choosing a command, such as the Open dialog in [Figure](#page-244-1) 14-55 (page 245) should display a title that matches the command.  
An alert can be document modal or application modal. If the error condition or notification appliesto a single document, the alert should be document modal (that is, a sheet). See the Save Changes alert in [Figure](#page-235-0) [14-46](#page-235-0) (page 236) for an example. If the alert appliesto the state of the application as a whole, or to more than one document or window belonging to that application, the alert should be application modal. Both the Review Changes alert for multiple unsaved documents ([Figure](#page-249-1) 14-60 (page 250)) and the Save Changes alert for applications that are not document-based [\(Figure](#page-249-0) 14-59 (page 250)) are application modal.

<span id="page-235-0"></span>A **sheet** is a modal dialog attached to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog appliesto. Because a sheet is attached to the window from which it emerges, a sheet does not have its own title. Figure 14-46 shows an example of a sheet.

The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window helps users take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model (see "Window [Layering"](#page-221-0) (page 222)). Sheets also allow usersto perform other tasks before dismissing the dialog, with no sense of the system being "hijacked" by the application.  
Lay out sheets as you would any other dialog in Mac OS X. For guidelines on laying out a dialog, see "Positioning [Regular-Size](#page-346-1) Controls in a Window Body" (page 347).  
#### **Sheet Behavior**  
Sheets are displayed as an animation that appears to emerge from the window's title bar. When a sheet opens on a window near the edge of the screen and the sheet is wider than the window it's attached to, the sheet movesthe window away from the edge; when the sheet is dismissed, the window returnsto its previous position.  
Only one sheet may be open for a window at any one time. A sheet prevents any other operation on that window until the sheet is dismissed. If, when the user responds to a sheet, another sheet for that document must open, the first sheet closes before the second one opens.  
A sheet on an active document window should cover (appear on top of) any active panels (if necessary). However, if the user leaves a sheet open and clicks another document in the same application, the inactive window and its sheet should go *behind* any open panels.  
<span id="page-236-4"></span>In an application that allows multiple windows for the same document (so that the user can see different parts of a document simultaneously), a sheet is not appropriate. Use an application modal dialog in this situation to make it clear that changes to one window affect other windows in the application.  
In an application that displays multiple documents in a single window at different times, such as in a tabbed browser, a sheet is appropriate even though it applies to only the current document in the view. This is because, in a single-window situation, the user can't move the view and its sheet aside to handle later when choosing to view a different document. Rather, the user in effect dismissesthe view's contents when choosing to view a different document. The usershould therefore dismissthe sheet on the current view before selecting a different document.  
#### <span id="page-236-1"></span>**When to Use Sheets**  
Use sheets for dialogs specific to a document when the user interacts with the dialog and dismisses it before proceeding with work. Here are some examples of when to use sheets:  
- A modal dialog for an activity that is specific to a particular document, such as saving or printing.
- A modal dialog that is specific to a single-window application that does not create documents. A single-window utility program might use a sheet to request acceptance of a licensing agreement from the user, for example.
- Other window-specific dialogs that are typically dismissed by the user before proceeding. Use a sheet when a dialog benefitsfrom being attached to the window as a modal dialog, even if you might otherwise design the dialog as a modeless dialog.  
#### **When Not to Use Sheets**  
Don't use sheets in the following situations:  
- For dialogs that apply to several windows. Use sheets only when a particular dialog is associated with only one window.
- <span id="page-236-3"></span>● For modeless operations in which the dialog should be left open to allow the user to observe the effects of changes applied. Such tasks (find and replace operations, for example) are better suited to modeless dialogs, panels, or drawers.
- <span id="page-236-0"></span>● On a window that doesn't have a title bar. Sheets should emerge from a definite visual edge.
- <span id="page-236-2"></span>● When the user will need information in the window that is essential to filling in requested information in the dialog.  
#### Alerts  
Alerts display messages to inform users of situations that are notable or potentially dangerous. Alerts are modal dialogs. For an alert that applies to one document or in single-window applications, display the alert as a sheet. See "When to Use [Sheets"](#page-236-1) (page 237) for guidelines.  
<span id="page-237-0"></span>Figure 14-47 shows the elements of an alert.

<span id="page-237-1"></span>See "A [Standard](#page-352-0) Alert" (page 353) for more information on laying out alerts.  
#### <span id="page-237-3"></span><span id="page-237-2"></span>**The Elements of an Alert**  
An alert should contain only the following elements:  
- <span id="page-237-7"></span>● **Alert message text**. This text, in emphasized (bold) system font, provides a short, simple summary of the error or condition thatsummoned the alert. Thisshould be a complete sentence; often it is presented as a question. See "Writing Good Alert [Messages"](#page-238-3) (page 239) for more information.
- **Informative text**. This text appears in the small system font and provides a fuller description of the situation, its consequences, and ways to get out of it. For example, a warning that an action cannot be undone is an appropriate use of informative text.  
<span id="page-237-5"></span>**Important:** Do not leave out the informative text. What you think of as an intuitive alert message might be far from intuitive to your users. Use informative text to reword and expand on the alert message text.  
- <span id="page-237-4"></span>● **Buttons for addressing the alert**. Button names should correspond to the action the user performs when pressing the button—for example, Erase, Save, or Delete. The rightmost button in the dialog, the action button, is the button that confirms the alert message text. The action button is usually, but not always, the default button. (Note that in Cocoa methods, the rightmost button is always referred to as the default button even though it might not be.) For more information, see ["Dismissing](#page-240-1) Dialogs" (page 241).
- <span id="page-237-6"></span>● **The application icon**. Because of the Mac OS X window layering model (described in ["Window](#page-221-0) [Layering"](#page-221-0) (page 222)), an icon is necessary to make it clear to the user which application is displaying the alert.  
In rare cases, you may want to display a caution icon in your alert, badged with the application icon as shown in Figure 14-48. A badged alert is appropriate only if the user is performing a task,such asinstalling software, and a possible side effect of that task would be the inadvertent destruction of data. Don't use a caution icon for tasks whose only purpose is to overwrite or remove data, such as Save or Empty Trash; too-frequent use of the caution icon dilutes its significance.

#### <span id="page-238-4"></span><span id="page-238-3"></span>**Writing Good Alert Messages**  
<span id="page-238-1"></span>A good alert message states clearly what caused the alert to appear and what the user can do about it. Express everything in the user's vocabulary. Figure 14-49 shows an example of an alert message that provides little useful information.

![](images/_page_238_Picture_7.jpeg)  
<span id="page-238-2"></span>You could improve this message by describing the problem in the user's vocabulary asshown in Figure 14-50.

![](images/_page_238_Picture_10.jpeg)  
To make the alert really useful, provide a suggestion about what the user can do about the current situation. Even if the alert serves as a notification to the user and no further action is required, provide as much information as needed to describe the situation. Figure 14-51 shows the alert with additional information.
