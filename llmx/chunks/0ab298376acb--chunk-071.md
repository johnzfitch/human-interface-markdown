<!-- Chunk 71 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 204 -->
People rely on the standard Macintosh user interface for consistency. Don't copy other platforms' user interface elements or behaviors in the Macintosh because they may confuse users who aren't familiar with them.  
There are times when the standard user interface doesn't cover the needs of your application. This is true in the following situations:  
- You are creating a new feature for which no element or behavior exists. In this case, you can extend the Macintosh user interface in a prescribed way.
- An existing element does almost everything you need it to, but a little modification that improves its function makes the difference to your application.  
The sections that follow present the guidelines that describe how to extend the Macintosh user interface guidelines.
