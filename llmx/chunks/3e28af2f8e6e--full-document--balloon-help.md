# Balloon Help

- Do you provide Balloon Help for items in dialog boxes, alert boxes, and menus?
- Do you provide Balloon Help for application window contents?

- Do you provide a custom help balloon for your application icon, if appropriate?
- Do your help balloons answer at least one of these questions:
  - What is this?
  - What does this do?
  - What happens if I click this?
- Is the content of the help balloons short and easy to understand?
- Do you use clear, concise phrases and active constructions?
- Do you use terminology consistently?
- When a balloon appears, is it positioned so that it does not obstruct any interface elements being referred to by the balloon?
- Do you provide different balloon messages for different states of an item (such as enabled, disabled, and checked)?
- Do you add a menu item for help-related information to the Help menu? Does this menu item use the name of your application?
