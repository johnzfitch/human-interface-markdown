The angles and shadows used for depicting various kinds of icons are intended to reflect how the objects would appear in reality. All Aqua interface elements have a common light source from directly above, not from the upper-left corner as in Mac OS 9 and earlier. The various perspectives are achieved by changing the position of an imaginary camera capturing the icon.

<span id="page-64-3"></span>Utility icons are depicted as if they were on a shelf in front of you. Flat objects appear as if there were a wall behind them with an appropriate shadow behind the object.

<span id="page-65-0"></span>An actual three-dimensional object such as a rocket, however, would more realistically be viewed sitting on the ground; its icon shows the rocket sitting on a shelf, with its shadow below it.

<span id="page-65-1"></span>For toolbar icons, the perspective is also straight-on, as if the object is on a shelf in front of you with the shadow below it.

Icons that represent actual objects should look as though they are made of real materials. Examine various objects to study the characteristics of plastic, glass, paper, and metal. Your icon will look more realistic if you successfully convey the item's weight and feel, as well as its appearance.  
<span id="page-65-2"></span>Use transparency only when it is convincing and when it helps complete the story the icon is telling. You would never see a transparent sneaker, for example, so don't use one in your icon.
