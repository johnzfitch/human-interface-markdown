Figure 15-1 shows a very simple preferences dialog. Note that a more advanced preferences dialog would use a toolbar to access the various sections.

This dialog provides a good example of a center-equalized dialog. In Mac OS X, controls should always be center-equalized in windows. In other platforms, including Mac OS 9, controls are often left justified. **Center equalization** simply means that the visual weight is balanced on the right and left side of the dialog's content area. It does not mean **center justification** where the left and right sides of an imaginary line drawn through the center of the dialog have exactly the same number of items or characters. Figure 15-2 highlights this equalization. Although the right side has more objects, it is balanced by the categorization labels on the left. The net result is a visually balanced dialog.

When labels and controls are stacked in a group, they should line up with each other vertically. In Figure 15-3, note the right alignment of the colons for the main category labels and the left alignment of the checkboxes and radio buttons.

There are specific spacing guidelines to keep in mind when designing dialogs. Although ["Controls"](#page-224-0) (page 225) gives some guidelines for how to arrange controls in relation to each other, in this chapter you can see how these controls should be arranged in relation to the window that contains them. Following are some guidelines that are easy to observe in Figure 15-4:  
- Controls not in a group box or a tab view should be 14 pixels from the title bar.
- There should be a 20 pixel margin all the left side, right side, and bottom of a dialog.
- For full-size controls, leave 8 pixels of space between controls.
- Leave at least 12 pixels of space above and below separators.
- Leave at least 16 pixels of space between the bottom group of controls and the buttons (the example in Figure 15-4 has 18 pixels)
