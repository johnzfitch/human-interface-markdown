**alert box** A view that appears on the screen to warn the user or  
report an error.  
**alert sound** An audible warning from the Newton's speaker that  
warns the user of an unusual or potentially undesirable  
situation. An alert sound may or may not be  
accompanied by a notification slip.  
**application** Software that performs a specific task, such as the  
Notepad, Date Book, and Names File.  
**application base view**  
The container view that contains all other views that  
make up an application. Compare to **main view.**  
**auto-repeat** The repeated automatic generation of characters that  
happens when a user holds down the pen on an  
on-screen keyboard.  
**backdrop** The one application that cannot be closed. Initially the  
Notepad is the backdrop, but a user can use the Extras Drawer to make a different application the backdrop.  
**bitmap** A set of bits in the Newton's memory that represent the  
pixels of a picture.  
**busy cursor** A graphical signal that the system displays  
automatically while it is temporarily unable to process  
user input.  
**button** A small graphic object that performs an action when  
tapped. See also **picture button** and **text button.**  
**button bar** A thick black line with buttons on it.  
**caret** A symbol (^) displayed where the Newton will next  
insert text that a user writes, prints, or types.  
**character** Any symbol that has a widely understood meaning and  
thus can convey information. Some characters—such as letters, numbers, and punctuation—can be displayed on the Newton, faxed, sent in an e-mail message, and  
printed on a printer.  
**checkbox** A standard Newton control that displays a setting,  
either checked (on) or unchecked (off). Tapping a checkbox or its text label reverses its setting. One or more checkboxes can be checked. Compare to  
**radio button.**  
**close** To make a container view go away by tapping the  
Close box.  
**Close box** A small square box with an X inside, located in the  
lower right corner of a container view. Tapping it closes the container view. Compare to **large Close box.**  
**command** An instruction that causes the Newton or a device  
connected to it to perform some action. The user issues a command by tapping a button or choosing an item  
from a picker.  
**confirmation slip** A view that appears on-screen to have the user confirm  
or cancel an action that may have far-reaching  
consequences.  
**container view** A framed object that displays information (text, graphics,  
or both) and may contain controls that the user operates by tapping, as well as areas where the user can write  
and draw.  
**context-sensitive** Describes an application that can adjust its actions  
according to the current situation. For example, an application with context-sensitive user input adjusts handwriting recognition according to the type of field (name, date, time, number, phone number, and so on).  
**control** An object in a container view that a user can manipulate  
with a pen to cause instant action with visible results or  
to change settings to modify a future action.  
**Date Book** The built-in application for recording and viewing  
appointments and calendar notes, setting alarms, entering repeating events, and keeping a to-do list.  
**dimmed** Describes words or objects that appear gray. Do not dim  
text or objects in Newton applications; hide objects that  
are disabled or unavailable.  
**divider bar** See **separator bar.**  
**double-tap** To touch the same spot, or nearly the same spot, twice in  
rapid succession with the pen.  
**drag** To place the pen on a movable object, slide the pen  
to move the object, and lift the pen to stop moving  
the object.  
**drag handle** A small control that a user can drag to move a container  
view. It is a small black tab with a central hole, and is  
centered in the view's top border.  
**drawer** A container view that slides open and closed at the  
bottom of another container view.  
**edit** To change or modify. For example, to insert, remove,  
replace, or move text.  
**electronic ink** The marks a user sees as the user writes or draws on the  
screen, as opposed to the typeset words or regular shapes the system displays when it recognizes the  
user's writing or drawing.  
**endpoint** A type of communications connection such as a  
serial connection, modem, infrared beam, or  
AppleTalk network.  
**expando** An input area that expands when tapped to become  
large enough for writing.  
**Extras Drawer** A built-in container view that displays named picture  
buttons a user can tap to open applications.  
**field** One item of data input. Also, the place in a container  
view where a user can input a data item by tapping,  
typing, writing, or drawing.  
**floating container view**  
A container view that initially appears in front of all  
open **sibling views.**  
**folder tab** A control that allows users to select which folder's  
contents are currently displayed in a container view. The folder tab goes at the top of the container view and displays the name of the currently selected folder.  
**font** A complete set of characters in one typeface design.  
**font size** The size of a font in **points.** Examples of font size are 12  
point and 18 point.  
**font style** A set of stylistic variations other than size, such as bold,  
italic, and underline.  
**gauge** An object with a marker that indicates an amount,  
degree, or value in relation to a range of possible values.  
A user can only read a gauge. Compare to **slider.**  
**glance** A small container view that closes itself automatically  
after it has been displayed for a brief period. Also, if a  
user taps the view, it closes immediately.  
**gravity** A drawing feature that causes the endpoints of a newly  
drawn line to snap to nearby corners and midpoints of  
existing graphic shapes.  
**highlight** To make something visually distinct, typically when  
it's selected. Usually done by reversing black and  
white areas.  
**hot spot** A small unnamed control that responds like buttons  
when tapped. Usually there are many hot spots in a  
view, and they can be visible or not.  
**icon** A symbol that graphically represents an object or a  
concept. For example, icons in the Extras Drawer  
represent applications.  
**Item Info slip** A slip that reports statistics for an item headed by a  
separator bar. The statistics include the item's title, type,  
creation date, size, and storage location. A user can change an item's title in the Item Info slip.  
**ink text** Words written in **electronic ink.**  
**input** Information transferred into a Newton from some  
external source, such as the pen or a modem.  
Compare to **output.**  
**input area** A place in a container view where a user can write  
or draw.  
**input line** An input area where a user can write one line of text.  
**insertion point** See **caret.**  
**interface** See **Newton user interface** and **user interface.**  
**invert** To highlight by changing white pixels to black and  
vice versa.  
**large Close box** Behaves the same as a **Close box** but looks slightly  
larger to match the standard height of a text button.  
**main view** A principal container view that serves as a center of  
user operations for an application. Compare to  
**application base view.**  
**matte border** A thick gray border framed with black**.**  
**message** An instruction to execute a **method** (a programmed  
function).  
**method** A programmed function. Each method contained in a  
template processes a particular message for the view that the template defines. When a view receives a message for which it has a method, the Newton executes  
that method.  
**Names File** The built-in application for storing names, addresses,  
phone numbers, and other information about people.  
**Newton user interface**  
The standard conventions for interacting with Newton devices. The interface ensures users a consistent means  
of interacting with all Newton devices and the  
applications designed to run on them.  
**Notepad** The built-in application for taking and organizing notes,  
which may contain text and drawings.  
**notification slip** A view that appears on the screen to warn the user or to  
report an error. A notification slip may or may not be  
accompanied by an alert sound.  
**output** Information transferred from a Newton to some  
external destination, such as a printer or a modem.  
Compare to **input.**  
**palette** A small view that provides controls for modifying the  
contents of other views. The user can move a palette, and it floats on top of other views of the same application, so it can remain open for use in all visible views.  
**parent view** A view that contains one or more other views.  
**persona** The permanent internal description of an individual  
person that works with a particular Newton PDA, or a particular public image of a single owner. The owner is the obvious example, but there can be many others. Choosing a persona sets up information such as name, title, birthday, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses.  
**picker** A list of choices that appears when the user taps an  
adjacent text label marked by a solid diamond (◆). A picker may also appear when a user taps a **button.** The user chooses one of the listed items by tapping it.  
**picture button** A control that the user taps to designate or confirm an  
action implied by the icon displayed on the button.  
**picture radio button**  
A standard Newton control that displays its state, either on or off, and is part of a group in which the user can turn on only one button at a time. A picture on the  
on-off indicator identifies the kind of setting.  
**pixel** Short for *picture element;* the smallest dot the Newton  
can draw on the screen. On a Newton MessagePad, there are 80 pixels to an inch. Each pixel can be either black or white, so it can be represented by a bit; thus,  
the display is said to be a **bitmap.**  
**point** A unit of measurement for type. 1 point equals  
approximately 1⁄ 72 inch.  
**proto template** A predefined template that defines the appearance and  
behavior of a standard interface element, such as a Close box or a status slip. A proto template is called a  
"proto" for short.  
**radio button** A standard Newton control that displays its state, either  
on or off, and is part of a group in which the user can turn on only one button at a time. A text label next to the on-off indicator identifies the kind of setting.  
**routing** The process of sending or receiving data through the  
built-in In/Out Box application using a communications transport such as printing, faxing, beaming, or e-mailing.  
**routing slip** A view in which a user specifies the sender, recipient,  
format, and other information needed to send data by the method the user picked from the Action picker.  
**scroll** To cause currently displayed data to move off the screen  
and be replaced by data that was not visible.  
**scrolling list** A boxed list of text items. A user sees more items by  
tapping the universal scroll arrows or optional local scroll arrows, and selects one or more items by  
tapping them.  
**select** To designate an object by tapping, double-tapping, or  
dragging across it. The next action that happens to an  
object happens to the selected object.  
**selection** The object or group of objects most recently designated  
to be affected by the next action.  
**separator bar** A heavy black line that heads each item in a view that  
can display multiple items at once. A separator bar carries the title of the item below it and also carries  
controls that affect only the one item.  
**shape** A picture composed of geometric shapes such as  
straight lines and curves, circles and ovals, and  
rectangles and other polygons.  
**sibling views** Two or more views contained by one other view  
(their **parent view**).  
**slider** A control with a marker that indicates an amount,  
degree, or value in relation to a range of possible values. The user can adjust the setting by dragging the marker  
on a slider. Compare to **gauge.**  
**slip** A matte-framed container view that an application  
displays to get detailed user input, or to present alternatives among which a user can choose to determine the outcome of a task just begun.  
**status box** A black-framed container view that displays a static  
message saying the Newton is busy completing a  
lengthy process.  
**status slip** A view that an application displays when it begins an  
operation that takes more than a few seconds to complete. A status slip contains a message describing  
the application's busy status.  
**system proto** See **proto template.**  
**tap** To touch briefly with the pen.  
**tap-and-a-half** To tap and then at the same spot quickly half-tap; the  
pen goes down, up, and down (but not up again).  
**template** A read-only data structure that precisely specifies a  
view, encapsulating all the view's attributes and  
behaviors.  
**text button** A control, bordered by a rounded rectangle, that the  
user taps to designate, confirm, or cancel an action  
described by a text label inside the border.  
**transport** A means of conveying data between the built-in In/Out  
Box application and a communications connection (serial connection, modem, infrared beam, AppleTalk  
network, and so on).  
**type ahead** The process by which the Newton system stores  
keystrokes (typed faster than the system can process)  
for later processing.  
**view** A visual object on the screen, including but not limited  
to a **container view.** For example, text buttons, pickers, and input areas are also views. Each view is internally  
represented by a **template.**  
**user interface** The rules and conventions by which a device  
communicates and interacts with the person  
operating it.  
**word wrap** The automatic continuation of text from the end of  
one line to the beginning of the next without breaking  
in the middle of a word.
