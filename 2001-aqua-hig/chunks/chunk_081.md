Before reopening a window, make sure that the size and state are reasonable for the user's current monitor setup, which may not be the same as the last time the document was open. For example, if a user opens a document to full size on a Cinema Display, then next opens the file on an iMac, open the document in a window sized for the smaller monitor, rather than the saved size. For more information on appropriate window size, see ["Resizing and Zooming Windows"](#page-76-2) [\(page 77\).](#page-76-2)  
<span id="page-74-1"></span><span id="page-74-0"></span>On a computer with more than one monitor, display the first new window visually centered in the screen containing the menu bar. If the user doesn't move that first window, display each additional window below and to the right of its predecessor. If the user moves the window, display each additional window on the screen that contains the largest portion of the frontmost window. If there is sufficient room on the screen, display subsequent windows to the lower right of the frontmost window. If there isn't enough room on the screen, display subsequent windows starting in the upper-left corner of the screen, and then continue to display additional windows slightly offset in relation to this new position. For example, if the user creates a window, drags it to a second monitor, and then creates a new window, display the new window on the second screen.

When you open several windows on multiple screens, continue to place the windows on the screen where the user is working, each new one below and to the right of its predecessor. Don't open a window so that it spans monitors; the *initial position* of a window should always be contained on a single screen.
