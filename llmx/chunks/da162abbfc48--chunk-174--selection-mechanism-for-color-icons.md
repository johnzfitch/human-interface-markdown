#### Selection Mechanism for Color Icons  
When a color icon is selected, the color decreases in brightness. This means that the colors appear darker when selected. On a color monitor, a black-and-white icon turns gray when selected. On a black-and-white monitor, a black-and-white icon uses reverse video to show selection. To make selected items appear distinct from unselected ones, use light colors for large areas. Note that only the 34 colors shown in Figure 8-23 get darkened when a color icon is selected. This means that if you use colors other than those 34 colors in large amounts in an icon, that icon will not get darkened and therefore will not look selected.
