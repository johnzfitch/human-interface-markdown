Although you don't use the status bar in the same way that you use other UI elements, it's important to understand its function in your app.

**Think twice before hiding the status bar if your application is not a game or full-screen media-viewing application**. Although these apps might permanently hide the status bar, you should understand the ramifications of this design decision. Permanently hiding the status bar means that users must quit your app to find out, for example, whether they need to recharge their device.  
Note that most iPad applications do not need to hide the status bar to gain extra space, because the status bar occupies such a small fraction of the screen. On iPad, the subtle appearance of the status bar does not compete with your application for the user's attention. The small size of the status bar, combined with the slightly rounded corners of the application's upper bar, make the status bar seem like part of the device background.  
**Consider hiding the status bar (and all other app UI) while people are actively viewing full-screen media**. If you do this, be sure to allow people to retrieve the status bar (and appropriate application UI) with a single tap. Unless you have a very compelling reason to do so, it's best to avoid defining a custom gesture to redisplay the status bar because users are unlikely to discover such a gesture or remember it.  
**When appropriate, display the network activity indicator**. The network activity indicator can appear in the status bar to show users that lengthy network access is occurring. To learn how to implement this indicator in your code, see "Network Activity [Indicator"](#page-126-1) (page 127).  
**On iPhone, specify the color of the status bar**. You can choose gray (the default color), opaque black, or translucent black (that is, black with an alpha value of 0.5).

Be sure to choose a status bar appearance that coordinates with the rest of your iPhone application. For example, avoid using a translucent status bar if the navigation bar is opaque.
