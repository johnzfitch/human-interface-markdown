#### When to use sound

There are two general ways that sound can be used in the interface:

- ☐ It can be **integrated** throughout the standard interface to help make the user aware of the state of the computer or application.
- ☐ It can be used to **alert** the user when something happens unexpectedly, in the background, or behind the user's back.

In general, when you would like to put an indicator on the screen to tell the user that something has occurred—for example, that mail has come in, or that a particular process has finished—this is a good time to use a sound.
