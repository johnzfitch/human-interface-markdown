Whenever possible, include support forindustry-standard file formats in your documents. Supporting standard file formats makes it easierto exchange data between your application and other applications. Users might also be more inclined to use your application if they know they can get their data into and out of it easily.  
When saving user-configurable data, make sureyou store it in a plain-text file that the user can modify. Mac OS X applications traditionallystore configuration data using XML. You canwrite out XML data using the preferences system and the XML support found in Core Foundation and Cocoa. For information about user preferences, see *Runtime Configuration Guidelines*.  
Many platforms rely on the existence of filename extensions to identify the type of a file. Although manylongtime Mac OS X developers may decrytheir use, filename extensions make it easierfor users to exchange files with users of those other platforms. Applications that save documents should be sure to include a filename extension appropriate to the contents of the document. At the same time, however, applications should take care to respect the user's filename extension preferences when displaying the names of files and documents.  
For more information and guidelines about supporting filename extensions, see *File System Overview*.
