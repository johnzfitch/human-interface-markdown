High-quality graphics not only improve the appearance of your app, they also help convey information to users and enhance the overall experience of your app. OS X users are accustomed to beautiful, meaningful graphics and they look for the same level of quality in the apps they use.  
**Make sure your graphics look professionally designed.** Don't underestimate the impact that beautiful, high-quality graphics have on your users. More than ever, people see gorgeous, professionally produced graphics all around them, and most people can readily discern differencesin quality. Low-quality graphics give people a bad impression and can negatively affect their perception an app's overall quality. To help ensure that users are delighted with your app, make graphics a priority in your design and development process.  
**Make sure your graphics look great in full screen.** If you allow users to take a window full screen, make sure you don't just scale up your graphics to fit. As a rule of thumb, always start with artwork that is larger than you need and then scale it down. (For some guidelines on scaling artwork, see ["Creating](#page-114-0) Great Icons for Any [Resolution"](#page-114-0) (page 115).)  
**When appropriate, consider adding the appearance of real-world materials.** In some cases, real-world textures, such as wood, leather, metal, or paper, can enhance the experience of an app and convey meaning to users. If this makes sense in your app, make sure that the texture you create:  
- Is authentic and expressive, and looks great at all resolutions
- Coordinates with the overall appearance of your app and does not look like it was added as an afterthought
- Enhances the user's experience and understanding  
For more guidelines related to using real-world appearances in your UI, see "Consider Adding [Physicality](#page-50-0) and [Realism"](#page-50-0) (page 51).  
**Make a great first impression with a beautiful app icon.** Your app icon is the first experience users have with your app, and it can have a marked effect on their expectations. Think of your app icon as your calling card, and spend the resources necessary to ensure that it makes the right impression on users. For example, the Garage Band app icon is a beautiful rendering of a guitar.

For some specific guidance on creating a great app icon, see "Icon Design [Guidelines"](#page-109-0) (page 110).  
**If they are needed, create control icons that are unambiguously expressive.** OS X provides many built-in icons that apps can use in controls to represent standard actions, such as unlock an object or stop the current process. As much as possible, you should use the standard icons in your app because users already know what they mean (to learn more about the built-in icons, see ["System-Provided](#page-318-0) Icons" (page 319)). If you need to represent an action for which there is no standard icon, you must create a custom icon that clearly conveys its meaning to users. For detailed guidance on creating custom icons, see ["Designing](#page-120-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 121).  
**Prepare for high resolution.** In version 10.7, OS X extended its support for high resolution. To take advantage of this, you should adapt your app by using the appropriate APIs and provide higher-resolution versions of your artwork, among other things. To learn more about supporting high resolution in your app, see *High Resolution Guidelines for OS X* ; for some guidance on scaling custom artwork, see ["Creating](#page-114-0) Great Icons for Any [Resolution"](#page-114-0) (page 115).
