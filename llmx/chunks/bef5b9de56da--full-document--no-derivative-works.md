Elements of Style: Designing an Interface that Works!

Goals

There are five goals to a program design:

- 1. Ease-of-Learning. 2. Ease-of-Use. 3. Satisfaction of human needs
- 4. Saleability 5. Power and expandability

Most of the science of human interface deals with increasing ease-of-learning and ease-of-use without seriously affecting power and expandability. Most of the art aims toward satisfying humans' need to feel warm, comfortable, and protected. All these, plus spark and flair, add up to products that sell and can be sold. We assume your competence as a designer or programmer in creating power and expandability in your program; the rest of this book will address how to fulfill the first four goals.

The Underlying Concepts

It is one thing to have the above goals in mind; it is another to be able to actively and effectively address them. The following basic concepts form an structure on which you can base both large-scale and day-to-day design decisions.
