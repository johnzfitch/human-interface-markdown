This Application Kit panel should come up showing the folder of the document being saved (the document in the main window). A document's folder is reflected in its window's title bar. For example, if the title bar shows  
UNTITLED-1 - INet/machine/home  
then the Save panel should come up showing lNetimachinelhome.
