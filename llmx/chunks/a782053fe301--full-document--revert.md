#### Revert

The Revert command discards all changes made to the active document since the last time it was saved or opened. The document that was last saved to the disk is reopened. When the user chooses Revert, display an alert box that warns the user about the potential data loss this operation will cause. Provide a cancel button so that the user has a way to back out of the situation. Figure 4-69 shows a File menu with the Revert command highlighted and an appropriate alert box.
