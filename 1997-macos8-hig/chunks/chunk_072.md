Traditional Mac OS menu behavior demanded that users press and hold on a menu while scrolling and selecting an item. This can be frustrating for many  
<span id="page-92-0"></span>users, so the Mac OS now features **sticky menus**. The name derives from the fact that clicking an item in the menu bar for less than the user-defined double-click interval results in the menu being displayed ("sticking") without forcing the user to continue holding the mouse button. If the user presses and holds an item in the menu bar for longer than the double-click interval, the menu will behave in the traditional manner, closing immediately after the mouse button is released.  
To select a desired item in a sticky menu, the user simply moves the mouse pointer to the item (which highlights it) and clicks. This selects the item and closes the menu. This convenience extends to any hierarchical menus which are linked to the sticky menu; each sub-menu will be displayed as a sticky menu when its linking item is highlighted.  
Clicking while the cursor is outside a sticky menu will close the menu without making any selection. Pressing a command key will close the menu and execute the appropriate command. A sticky menu will also close on its own after fifteen seconds have elapsed without a selection being made.
