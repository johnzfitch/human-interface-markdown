Use the **colon** character (:) in text that introduces and provides context for controls. The text can describe what the controls do or a task the user can perform with them. The combination of introductory text, colon, and controls forms a visually distinct grouping that helps users find the controls that apply to a particular task and understand what the controls do.  
Because a colon implies a direct connection between the descriptive text and a particular control or set of controls, it does not belong in the text that appears in a control, such as a push button name or a command pop-down menu title. Similarly, you should not use a colon in the text that appears in the following user interface elements:  
- Menu items (unless the colon is part of a user-created menu item) and menu titles
- Tab and segmented controls
- List view column headings  
**Note:** The colon is not used as a pathname separator in Mac OS X. If it is necessary to display a raw pathname, use the forward slash character (/). Always be sure to avoid displaying a pathname in a window title.  
Although the colon is a good way to associate introductory text with related controls, be aware that you can depict this connection in other ways. For example, you might choose to place related controls in a group box and display the introductory text as the title of the group box (see ["Group](#page-333-0) Boxes" (page 334) for group box guidelines). Or, you might use separatorsto divide a window into sections of related controls and display a section title aligned with each separator (see ["Separators"](#page-331-1) (page 332) for separator guidelines). You might also use tab orsegmented controlsto display different groups of related controls(see "Tab [Views"](#page-328-0) (page 329) and ["Segmented](#page-276-0) Controls" (page 277) for guidelines on how to use these controls). To see how the appearance of a window changes when some of these different grouping methods are used, see ["Grouping](#page-348-0) Controls in a [Window](#page-348-0) Body" (page 349)  
If you choose to use a group box or separator to group controls, do not use a colon in the text that serves as a group box title or the text that appears on the same line as a separator. In these cases, other graphical elements (that is, the group box and the separator) take the place of the colon and make explicit the relationship of the introductory text to the controls that follow it.

If you choose to use a colon to show the relationship between introductory text and controls, the following guidelines and examples will help you use it appropriately.  
<span id="page-128-1"></span>**Use a colon in introductory text that precedes a control or set of related controls**. The text can be a noun or phrase that describes either the target of the control or the task the user can perform. The following examples illustrate some variations on this arrangement of text and controls:  
■ Figure 10-2 shows the correct usage of a colon in introductory text that describes the feature a control affects and appears on the same line with it.  
**Figure 10-2** Use a colon in text that precedes a control on the same line  
![](images/_page_128_Picture_12.jpeg)  
■ The introductory text shown in Figure 10-3 describes a task to which more than one control applies. The proximity of the two checkboxes and the colon in the descriptive text imply to the user that both controls can be used to affect the task.  
<span id="page-129-0"></span>**Figure 10-3** Use a colon in text that precedes the first control in a vertical list of controls  
![](images/_page_129_Picture_3.jpeg)  
<span id="page-129-1"></span>The grouping of text and controlsin Figure 10-4 shows another way to use a colon in text that introduces multiple controls.  
**Figure 10-4** Use a colon in text that precedes the first control in a horizontal list of controls  
![](images/_page_129_Picture_6.jpeg)  
<span id="page-129-2"></span>■ Introductory text that appears above the control it describes should include a colon, as shown in Figure 10-5  
**Figure 10-5** Use a colon in introductory text that appears above a control  
![](images/_page_129_Picture_9.jpeg)  
<span id="page-129-3"></span>■ If the text describes a radio button or checkbox state and also introduces a second control, it should include a colon before the second control, as shown in Figure 10-6 (Note that if the text describing a checkbox or radio button state does not introduce a second control, it should not include a colon.)  
**Figure 10-6** Use a colon in checkbox or radio button text that introduces a second control  
![](images/_page_129_Picture_12.jpeg)  
**Note:** If you use the type of layout shown in Figure 10-6 be sure to disable the second control when the preceding checkbox or radio button is unselected.  
**A colon is optional before a control that is part of a sentence or phrase**. This guideline is flexible because it depends on how much of the text follows the control and how the sentence or phrase can be interpreted. Consider the specific combination of text and controls and the overall layout of your window as you decide whether to use the colon in the following situations.  
If, for example, none of the text follows the control, then the control's value supplies the end of the sentence or phrase. A colon is recommended in this case, because this is another variation of the guideline to include a colon in text that precedes a control. Figure 10-7 shows an example of this type of text.  
<span id="page-130-2"></span>**Figure 10-7** A colon is recommended in a sentence that is completed by a control's value  
![](images/_page_130_Figure_5.jpeg)  
<span id="page-130-3"></span>If, on the other hand, a substantial portion of the sentence or phrase follows the control, as shown in Figure 10-8 a colon is optional.  
**Figure 10-8** A colon is optional if the text following the control forms a substantial part of the sentence  
![](images/_page_130_Figure_8.jpeg)  
<span id="page-130-0"></span>Similarly, if there is some text following the control, but that text does not represent a substantial portion of the sentence or phrase, the colon is optional. To help you decide whether a colon is appropriate in these cases, determine if the presence of a colon breaks the sentence or phrase (including the value of the control) in an awkward or unnatural way.
