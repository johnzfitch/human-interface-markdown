**Don't take space away from the content people care about.** For example, displaying a second, persistent bar at the top of the screen that does nothing but display brand assets meansthat there'slessroom for content. Instead, defer to the user's content and consider less intrusive ways to display pervasive branding, such as using a custom tint or font, or subtly customizing the background of a screen.  
**Resist the temptation to display your logo throughout the app.** Mobile device screens are relatively small, and every occurrence of a logo takes space away from the content that users want to see. What's more, displaying a logo in an app doesn't serve the same purpose as displaying it in a webpage: It's common for users to arrive on a webpage without knowing its owner, but it's much less likely that users will open an iOS app without seeing its app icon.
