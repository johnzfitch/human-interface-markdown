<span id="page-150-2"></span>A **group box** is used to associate a set of related items—such as radio buttons or pop-up menus—in a dialog.  
As much as possible, *use additional space between controls to create groups of controls, rather than group boxes.* Excessive use of group boxes creates visual clutter; too many lines and edges can distract users. Also use space or separator lines, rather than secondary group boxes, for subgroupings. The following figures show examples of how to successfully re-create dialogs using space rather than group boxes. When space alone isn't enough to clearly divide areas, use a label and a separator, as shown in the following "after" examples.  
Within a group box, no control or label should be positioned within 16 pixels of the box's top, bottom, left, or right borders.  
Group boxes can be untitled or titled. Titles can be static text, a checkbox label, or text in a pop-up menu.

After (example 2)  
In the second "after" example, the group boxes have been replaced by horizontal lines that serve as separators; the lines are 2 pixels to the right of the label and base-aligned with the label text. Although the overall look of the dialog is centered, the two labels, as well as the lines, are right-aligned; flush-left controls would imply an inappropriate hierarchy. The distance from the left edge of the pane to the label text and from the end of the line to the right edge of the pane should be equal.

After  
In the "after" example, the labels are left-aligned, since they are next to checkboxes, which are most commonly stacked vertically.
