#### Active Users

Unless people are actively involved in what they are doing, they don't remember what they've done and don't learn much from the experience. Computer interactions require that users participate in the exchange with the computer. It is unfortunate when users react in a non-planned way to the computer's actions. The Apple Desktop Interface is designed explicitly to maximize the individual's involvement in computer activities. Most of the time, users have a wide range (not simply a constrained set) of possible activities from which they choose.

Users can customize the interface to their tastes and tasks. Consider the Control Panel, which allows them to choose (or create) background desktop patterns, set the sound volume, and so on. User can arrange icons on the desktop in whatever way helps them categorize and find things. And they can choose from several ways to view files and documents. All this relieves the computer designer from having to create a system that matches every person. Instead, the designer creates a general model that individual users can tailor to their individual needs.
