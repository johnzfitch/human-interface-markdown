Tear-off menus are menus, generally graphical rather than textual, that can be "torn" from the menu bar and moved around the screen like a window. Tear-off menus save desktop space, allow larger windows, and give the user more flexibility than fixed palettes.  
The user can choose a tool from the tear-off menu shown in Figure 45 simply by pulling down the menu like any other menu, then dragging the pointer to the desired tool and releasing the mouse button.

Figure 45 Graphical pull-down menu  
If the user holds down the Apple key while opening such a menu, then moves the pointer more than ten pixels from any edge of the menu, an outline of the menu follows the pointer. When the mouse button is released, the menu appears at its new location.

Figure 46 Torn off menu  
Even after a menu has been torn off, it can still be accessed from the menu bar. The state of the torn-off menu must be reflected in its pull-down counterpart, and vice versa. A given menu can exist in torn-off form only once: if the user tears it off a second time, the first instance disappears.

Torn-off menu also available in menu bar  
Like document windows, torn-off menus can be dragged around the screen and closed with a close box. To avoid confusion, however, tear-off menus don't look exactly like document windows. Tear-off menus are always "in front" of all open document windows. If a single application can have more than one menu torn off at a time, the application must determine their order of precedence.
