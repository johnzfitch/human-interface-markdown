Your application must determine whether to move or copy a dragged item after it is dropped on a destination. The appropriate behavior depends on the context of the drag-and-drop operation, as described here.  
<span id="page-219-8"></span><span id="page-219-6"></span>If the source and destination are in the same container (for example, a window or a volume), a drag-and-drop operation is interpreted as a move (that is, cut and paste). Dragging an item from one container to another initiates a copy (copy and paste). The user can perform a copy operation within the same container by pressing the Option key while dragging.  
<span id="page-219-10"></span>You can't assume that a window is always a container; you must consider the underlying data structure of the contents in the window. For example, if your application allows two windows to display the same document (multiple views of the same data), a drag-and-drop operation between these two windows should result in a move.
