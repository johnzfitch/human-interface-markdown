- <span id="page-70-5"></span>■ **Sheets:** A sheet is a new type of dialog that is "attached" to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog applies to. The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window enables users to take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model and also encourages modelessness. For more information, see ["Document-Modal Dialogs \(Sheets\)" \(page 72\)](#page-71-2).
- <span id="page-70-6"></span>■ **Alerts:** To help the user identify which application an alert belongs to, all alerts should display the application's icon. In rare cases, when there is a critical need to warn the user of a potentially data-damaging operation, the alert can display the caution icon over the application icon.  
<span id="page-71-4"></span>■ **Modality:** There are very few situations in Mac OS X where a dialog must be addressed before the user is allowed to do anything else. The vast majority of dialogs should be either application modal (the user must address the dialog before doing anything else in the application) or document modal, not system modal. All modal dialogs should be movable.
