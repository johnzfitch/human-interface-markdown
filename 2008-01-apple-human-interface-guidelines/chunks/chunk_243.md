Use capsule-style toolbar controls in a toolbar to give users access to frequently used objects and commands (for guidelines on designing the contents of a toolbar, see ["Designing](#page-204-1) a Toolbar" (page 205)).For example, Mail uses capsule-style toolbar buttons and segmented controls to provide a myriad of functions to the user, such asgetting new mail, creating notes orto-do items, and flagging messages. Figure 15-6 shows these controls in the Mail toolbar.

Do not use capsule-style toolbar controls in a bottom bar. If you use capsule-style toolbar controls in the toolbar, but you also need to provide bottom-bar controls, instead use rectangular-style toolbar controls in both areas to avoid mixing the styles in a single window. See ["Rectangular-Style](#page-259-1) Toolbar [Controls"](#page-259-1) (page 260) for more information about the rectangular-style toolbar controls.  
#### Capsule-Style Toolbar Control Contents and Labeling  
Capsule style toolbar buttons can contain text or images. If you provide a capsule-style segmented control, avoid displayingtext in some segments and icons in others. Instead, make sure everysegment in the control has the same type of content.  
If you display an icon in a capsule-style toolbar control, be sure the meaning of the icon is clear and unambiguous (see ["Cultural](#page-49-1) Values" (page 50) for some advice on choosing appropriate imagery). In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, Interface Builder makes it easy to add system-provided images, such as the plus sign, the accounts symbol, and the Action menu symbol. See ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155) for more information on images available in Mac OS X v10.5 and later.  
If you decide to create your own icons to display in a capsule-style toolbar control, see ["Designing](#page-153-1) Icons for [Capsule-Style](#page-153-1) Toolbar Controls" (page 154) for some tips and guidelines.  
Ifyouwant to displaytext in a capsule-style toolbar control, use a noun (or noun phrase) that describes an object, setting, or state, or use a verb (or verb phrase) that describes an action. Text in capsule-style toolbar controls has title-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-135-0) of Interface Element Labels and [Text"](#page-135-0) (page 136) for more on this style).  
**Important:** You must supply a descriptive label for each capsule-style toolbar control you place in a toolbar so that users can customize the toolbar to display both images and text. This is the external label users see when they select the Icon & Text and Text Only display options in the Customize Toolbar dialog.  
#### Capsule-Style Toolbar Control Specifications  
**Control sizes**: Capsule-style toolbar controls are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. You should use regular-size capsule-style toolbar controls by default, but you should also provide small versions of the controls so users can customize the toolbar.  
If you use system-provided images in a capsule-style toolbar control, you don't have to worry about changing the width of the control to accommodate its contents. If you provide a custom icon, be sure to avoid extending it into the end-cap space of the control.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Labels for capsule-style toolbar controls should be in the system font appropriate for the size of the control (these fonts are automatically supplied by Interface Builder):  
- Regular size: System font.
- Small: Small system font.
- Mini: Mini system font.  
**Control spacing**: There should be 8 pixels between separate capsule-style toolbar controls. Note that this happens automatically, and that this spacing can change depending on the length of the external label.  
#### Capsule-Style Toolbar Control Implementation  
<span id="page-267-0"></span>Capsule-style toolbar controls are available in Interface Builder. Drag a segmented control object into your window and specify how many segments you want it to have. To create a standalone button (like the Get Mail button in the Mail toolbar), specify one segment. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the NSSegmentedControl class.
