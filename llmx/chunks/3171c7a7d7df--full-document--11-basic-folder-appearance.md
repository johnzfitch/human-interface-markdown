## 11. BASIC FOLDER APPEARANCE

A folder is drawn as a white rectangle (filled in by the application) with a thin (one pixel) black border. Every folder has a tab, which looks like a tab on a standard manilla folder. The tab is always above the upper left corner of the folder. It is called the title tab.

The rectangular portion of the folder that holds the folder's contents is called the body of the folder.
