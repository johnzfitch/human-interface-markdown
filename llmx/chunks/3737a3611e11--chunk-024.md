The computer must communicate in plain language. Don't use computer jargon that impresses or intimidates more than it informs or clarifies. Because the desktop interface doesn't support traditional system prompts, and because most of its actions are determined when the user selects from available possibilities, there is seldom need for many words. When words are needed, it usually happens in dialog boxes, when the user is asked to choose among alternatives or to acknowledge a situation.
