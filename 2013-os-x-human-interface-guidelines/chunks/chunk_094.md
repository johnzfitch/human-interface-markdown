If you have an existing set of app icon resources, the following techniques can help you get great results as you create high-resolution versions of your artwork.  
**Scale up your original artwork and then redraw.** Using the nearest-neighbor scaling algorithm, scale your original artwork to 200%. This works well if the original artwork wasn't created with vector shapes and doesn't include layer effects. The result is a large, pixelated image on top of which you can draw matching high-resolution art. This is a good way to begin because it allows you to preserve the original layout of your design.  
If the original artwork was created with vector shapes or includes layer effects, you can use the default scaling algorithm instead of the nearest-neighbor algorithm.  
**Add detail and depth.** Don't hesitate to draw very small elements, because the high-resolution version of your artwork allows much more room for fine details. For example, a 1-pixel dot in your original image becomes a 4-pixel dot (that is, 2 x 2 pixels) in the larger version.  
**Consider softening scaled-up elements.** If, for example, you have a sharp, 1-pixel dividing line in your original artwork, it might have the boldness you want when it isscaled to a 2-pixel line. But forsome lines and elements, you might want to soften the scaled results by feathering or even leaving the element at the smaller size.  
**Consider adding blur for better results in effects such as engravings and drop shadows.** For example, text engraving istypically done by shifting a duplicate image of the text by 1 pixel. Scaled up, thisshift would result in an engraving width of 2 pixels, which is likely to look very sharp and unrealistic at a higher resolution. To improve the appearance, you can leave the shift as-is (that is, at 1 pixel), but add a 1-pixel blur to soften the engraving. This still results in a 2-pixel-wide engraving effect, but the outer pixel now looks more like it's only half a pixel wide, which results in a better sense of dimensionality.

If you don't have an existing set of icon resources, the following tips can help you create standard- and high-resolution versions of your app icon.  
**Start with a large master art file and scale it down to the smaller sizes.** It's especially useful to create your master image in a dimension that's a multiple of the icon sizes you need. For example, to create icons in the recommended sizes listed in [Table](#page-116-1) 5-1 (page 117), first create a 1024 x 1024 pixel version of your master file.  
**Use an appropriate grid size.** As you create the master image, using a grid ensures that you get sharp lines on important pieces of the design, such as the outline. As you scale down, you'll be able to keep each smaller icon version crisp, and reduce the amount of retouching and sharpening you need to do.  
In your image-editing app, set up an 8-pixel grid, which means each block in the grid measures 8 x 8 pixels and represents 1 pixel in the 128 x 128 pixel icon. As you create your master file, "snap" the image to the grid and keep it within the boundaries to minimize the half pixels and blurry details that can result when you scale it down.  
**Redraw art as you scale down.** If you're not satisfied with the results when you scale down art to the 32 x 32 pixel and 16 x 16 pixel sizes, redraw the image at these sizes instead. If you decide to do this, setting up the proper grid can still help reduce extra work. For example, using a 32-pixel grid works well for creating the 32 x 32 pixel size, and a 64-pixel grid works well for creating the 16 x 16 pixel size.

If you're creating an OS X version of an iOS app, you want an icon that users recognize, but you don't want a carbon copy of the iOS app icon. In particular, the OS X app icon shouldn't use the same rounded rectangle shape that the iOS app icon uses. App Store, Calendar, and Contacts provide icons for OS X and iOS that are recognizable, yet distinct from one another. (iOS 6 app icons shown here.)

#### <span id="page-119-1"></span>Packaging Your Icon Resources  
After you've created the necessary app icon assets, place them in folder a named icon.iconset.  
![](images/_page_119_Picture_6.jpeg)  
**Tip:** You can preview the .iconset folder to ensure the proper alignment and resolution handling of all your app icon resources by selecting the folder in Finder and pressing the Space bar to view it in Quick Look. Adjust the slider at the bottom of the Quick Look window to view the various assets as though they are one icon.  
Use the system-provided tools to convert your .iconset folder into a single .icns file. First, use an image-editing program to output app icons in the PNG format, which preserves your design's alpha values. Your source art files should use sRGB and retain their color profiles. You don't need to compress image files because the tools used to package them take care of compression for you.  
To create an .icns file, use iconutil in Terminal. Terminal is located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal. Enter the command iconutil -c icns <iconset filename>, where <iconset filename> isthe path to the .iconset folder. You must use iconutil, not Icon Composer, to create high-resolution .icns files. For more information, see "Provide High-Resolution Versions of All App Graphics Resources" in *High Resolution Guidelines for OS X* .  
There are also several third-party tools available for completing thisstep. Note that an .icns file is appropriate for app icons and document icons only; it is not an acceptable format to use for other types of icons in your app. (To learn more about creating document iconsfor your app,see ["Designing](#page-125-0) Document Icons" (page 126).)
