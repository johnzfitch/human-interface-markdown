<!-- Chunk 73 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 960 -->
Windows on-screen are ordered from front to back. Like sheets of paper loosely stacked together, windows in front can overlap, or even completely cover, those behind them. Each window has a unique position in the order. When two windows are placed side-by-side, one is still technically in front of the other.  
If any window could be in front of any other window, then small but important windowslike menus and docked icons-might get lost behind larger ones. Windows that require user action, like attention panels and pop-up lists, might disappear behind another window and go unnoticed. To prevent this, all the windows on-screen are organized into *tiers.*  
When two windows belong to the same tier, either one can be in front. When two windows belong to different tiers, however, the one in the higher tier will always be above the other. on-screen windows are divided into these seven tiers:  
- Windows that appear in a spring-loaded mode-pop-up lists, pull-down lists, and menus that come to the cursor-are assigned the frontmost tier. (Having menus come to the cursor is an option that the user can enable with the Preferences application. It's described in "Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor" in Chapter 6.) Spring-loaded windows remain on-screen only while the user holds a mouse button down, so they only momentarily obscure other windows. Putting them in the first tier guarantees that they won't appear in back of another window.
- Attention panels are assigned to the second tier. Like spring-loaded windows, they're only temporarily on-screen. But unlike spring-loaded windows, the user must do something to dismiss them, rather than continue an action to keep them visible. Keeping an attention panel in front, where it can't be covered by other windows, confronts the user with it until it's dismissed and thus encourages prompt user action.
- The main menu is assigned the next tier back. In the absence of an attention panel or spring-loaded window, the usual case, it's the frontmost window on-screen.
