People make specific finger movements, called gestures, to operate the unique Multi-Touch interface of iOS-based devices. For example, people tap a button to activate it, flick or drag to scroll a long list, or pinch open to zoom in on an image.  
<span id="page-13-2"></span>The Multi-Touch interface gives people a sense of immediate connection with their devices and enhances their sense of direct manipulation of onscreen objects.  
People are comfortable with the standard gestures because the built-in applications use them consistently. Their experience using the built-in apps gives people a set of gestures that they expect to be able to use successfully in most other apps.

Both iPhone and iPad support multifinger gestures. Even though a largerscreen has more room for additional touches, that does not mean that multifinger gestures are always better.
