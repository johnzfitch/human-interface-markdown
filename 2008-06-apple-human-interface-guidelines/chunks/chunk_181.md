<span id="page-134-0"></span>This chapter describes the overall philosophy behind icons and shows how to design application, document, toolbar, and other types of icons for Mac OS X.  
Aqua offers a photo-illustrative icon style—it approaches the realism of photography but uses the features of illustrations to convey a lot of information in a small space. Icons can be represented in 512 x 512 pixels to allow ample room for detail. Anti-aliasing makes curves and nonrectilinear lines possible. Alpha channels and translucency allow for complex shading and dimensionality. All of these qualities allow you to create lush, vibrant icons that capture the user's attention.  
To represent your application in Mac OS X, it's essential to create high-quality application icons that scale well in the various places the icon appears—the Dock, Finder and Quick Look previews, alert dialogs, and so on.
