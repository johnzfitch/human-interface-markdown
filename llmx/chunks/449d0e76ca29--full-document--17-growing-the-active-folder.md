# 17. GROWING THE ACTIVE FOLDER

The grow icon, located just beyond the right bottom corner of the active folder, (where the scrollbars intersect), is used to change the size of the active folder. (See illustrations.)

If you press the mouse button with the cursor in the grow icon, a flickering outline of the folder will appear and its lower right corner will follow the cursor as long as the button is held down. When you release the button, the application will "resize" the folder, that is, adjust its lower right hand corner at a position at (or close to) the lower right hand corner of the flickering outline. The application can restrict the minimum and maximum dimensions of the folder.

In text, the selection is usually a contiguous span of characters nighlighted in inverse video. When it contains no characters, it appears as a blinking vertical line which we sometimes call the caret.

In graphics the selection will probably be highlighted by the 'marching ants' technique used in the forms editor.

When a document is passive, its selection becomes only dimly highlighted, such as characters on a gray background or halted 'ants'. Blinking selections stop blinking in a passive document. When the document is once again made active, its selection is restored to full highlighting.
