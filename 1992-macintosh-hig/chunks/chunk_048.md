People who have a physical disability that requires additional access methods include individuals with congenital anomalies, spinal cord injuries, or progressive diseases and individuals who are without the use of a hand or an arm. People in this group mainly have difficulty with computer input devices, such as the mouse or keyboard, and with handling storage media.  
If you create hardware, make sure that you don't impose any physical barriers to storage media that would impede someone with limited or no use of the hands or arms. For example, a disk drive with a latch would be difficult to open for a user who interacts with the computer by holding a pencil in the mouth.  
If you can provide a mouse method and an alternative keyboard method for accomplishing tasks in software or hardware, you can accommodate most people's physical needs. (Note that this doesn't mean you should assign a keyboard equivalent to every menu item.)
