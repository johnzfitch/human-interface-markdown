## **File Packages**

*Afile package* is a folder that the Workspace Manager presents to users as if it were a file. Because users normally don't look inside a file package (unless they explicitly open it as a folder), they're not likely to alter or reorganize its contents. "Using File Packages," later in this chapter, describes when you should use file packages.
