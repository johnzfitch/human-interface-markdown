Applications can choose to assign a different meaning to mouse actions that occur when the user is holding down a modifier key. Modified mouse actions should implement only optional or advanced features of the user interface (because they're harder to remember and require more coordination to produce). They typically extend or alter the effect of the unmodified mouse action. For example:  
- Dragging a file icon from one directory window to another moves or copies the file to the new directory, depending on whether the directories are on the same disk or a different disk. Command-dragging moves the file always. Alternate-dragging copies the file always. Control-dragging is similar to copying, but the new "copy" of the file is simply a link to the old copy. The user can see what's going to happen because the cursor changes (to CO, for exainple, when Alternate-dragging).
- Clicking a scroll button scrolls a line of text. Alternate-clicking scrolls a larger amount.
- Dragging a window by its title bar moves the window, brings it to the front, and activates its application. Alternate-dragging moves the window and brings it to the front, but doesn't activate its application.
- Clicking selects a new insertion point in text. Alternate-clicking extends the selection . to include everything between the current insertion point and the point of the click. If an application implements discontinuous selection, Shift-clicking selects a new insertion point without dropping the old selection. If discontinuous selection isn't implemented, Shift-clicking acts like Alternate-clicking.
- Clicking selects an icon in a directory window. Shift-clicking adds new icons to the current selection.  
**Note:** Caps Lock doesn't work for Shift-clicking or Shift-dragging-the Shift key must be held down manually. This way, users won't find themselves Shift-clicking by mistake when they intend only to click.  
The Control key (with no other modifier keys) is often used for mouse actions that create or act on links. If your application's documents can receive linked information, then you need to implement the Control-double-click accelerator, as described in the discussion of the Link Inspector panel in Chapter 5, "Panels."  
Some modifier keys should be used only in limited circumstances:  
- The Help key should be used only for Help-clicking, which brings up help on the clicked object.
- The combination of Alternate and Control should be used only as a substitute for the Help key. (This is necessary because some keyboards don't have a Help key.)  
Applications should avoid distinguishing between the left and right key of the Shift, Alternate, and Command pairs. Users don't expect such a distinction except for certain computerwide, potentially destructive operations, such as resetting the computer's processor. Also, there's no hardware-independent way to differentiate the left and right modifier keys.
