Windows can look different based on how the user is interacting with them. The foremost document or app window that is the focus of the user's attention is called the **main window**. The main window is often also the **key window**, which isthe window that accepts user input. For example, the "close window" keyboard shortcut, Command-W, always targets the key window.  
Although the main window is often also the key window, this is not always the case. Sometimes a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window remains the focus of the user's attention. For example, users might be working in a document window when they need to open a standalone inspector or the Colors window to make adjustments. In this situation, the document window remains the main window, but the inspector or Colors window is the key window.  
Main and key windows are both active windows. By default, only an **active window** uses any translucency. In other words, UI elements that can be translucent, such as toolbars, title bars, and sidebars, appear translucent only when their window is active.  
Inactive windows are open windows that are not in the foreground. In an **inactive window**, translucent UI elements are opaque by default. Here you can see the visual distinctions between main, key, and inactive windows.
