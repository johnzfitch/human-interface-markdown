This chapter discusses windows in general-standard windows, panels, menus, pop-up and pull-down lists, miniwindows, and application icons-before going on to discuss standard windows in particular. For more information on panels and menus, see Chapter 5, "Panels," and Chapter 6, "Menus," respectively. For more information on pop-up and pull-down lists, see Chapter 7, "Controls." Miniwindows and application icons are described in Chapter 1, "A Visual Guide to the User Interface."
