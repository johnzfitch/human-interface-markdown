### **Human Control**

People want to feel in control. They want to make the decisions, not leave them to the computer or the software designer. Rather than having to remember all available options, they want to be able to select from alternatives presented to them on the screen. As they gain confidence, they expect to be able to get their work done with a minimum of fuss. Pull-down menus, dialog boxes, and desk accessories (such as Control Panel and Chooser) put the user in control of the computer.

People also appreciate being able (but not being required) to control the superficial aspects of their work environment—such as the arrangement and size of objects on the screen. That's why the Macintosh Finder lets users view their documents in different ways (by icon, by date, by size) and why the Control Panel offers control over sound volume, desktop background pattern, and so on. Messy screens and disorganized folders are acceptable if the *user* creates the mess! Applications should never override preferences the user has set with the Control Panel—if the user has set sound volume to zero, the computer should be silent.
