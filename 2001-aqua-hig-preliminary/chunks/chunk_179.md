- Do your icons represent objects that users are familiar with and that are universally recognizable?
- Do you use a common theme for icons associated with your application?
- Do you avoid using replicas of Apple hardware (which change often) in your icons?
- Do your icons fit in with the Aqua style—that is, high-quality, realistic, emotive?
- Are icon shadows realistic? Do you use a single center-top light source?
- Do all your icons use the same perspective?
