Across the full width of the top of the screen there is always a thin band of white with a collection of menu titles in it; it is called the Menu B ar and is described in section 24.  
The rest of the screen is gray and represents a desktop. Documents on that desk are presented in images that look much like traditional file folders. Many of these folders may sit on the desk at the same time, they may overlap, and they may be moved about on the desk, discarded, or filed away in a filing cabinet.
