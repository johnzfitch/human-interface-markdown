- Occupies the entire screen or, on iPad, can occupy the entire area of a parent view (such as a popover)
- Contains the text and controls that are necessary to complete the task
- Usually displays a button that completesthe task and dismissesthe view and a Cancel button that abandons the task and dismisses the view  
Use a modal view when you need to offer the ability to accomplish a self-contained task related to your app's primary function. A modal view is especially appropriate for a multistep subtask that requires UI elements that don't belong in the main app UI all the time.  
**On iPad, choose a modal view style that suits the current task and the visual style of your app.** You can use any of these styles, defined here:  
| Modal view<br>style | Appearance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Recommended for                                                                                                                                   |

**On iPad, don't display a modal view on top of a popover.** With the possible exception of an alert, nothing should display on top of a popover. In rare cases when you might need to display a modal view as a result of an action the user takes in a popover, close the popover before you open the modal view.  
**On iPhone, coordinate the overall look of a modal view with the appearance of your app.** For example, a modal view often includes a navigation bar that contains a title and buttonsthat cancel or complete the modal view's task. When this is the case, the navigation bar should use the same appearance as the navigation bar in the app.  
**On all devices, display a title that identifies the task, if appropriate.** You might also display text in other areas of the view that more fully describes the task or provides some guidance.  
**On all devices, choose an appropriate transition style for revealing the modal view.** Use a style that coordinates with your app and enhances the user's awareness of the temporary context shift that the modal view represents. To do this, you can specify one of the following transition styles:  
- **Vertical.** In the vertical style, the modal view slides up from the bottom edge of the screen and slides back down when dismissed (this is the default transition style).
- **Flip.** In the flip style, the current view flips horizontally from right to left to reveal the modal view. Visually, the modal view looks as if it is the back of the current view. When the modal view is dismissed, it flips horizontally from left to right, revealing the previous view.  
**If you vary the transition styles for modal views in an app, do so in a way that makes sense to users.** Users are quick to notice behavioral differences in an app and will assume that they mean something. It's best to establish a logical, consistent pattern that users can easily detect and remember, and avoid changing transition styles without a good reason.
