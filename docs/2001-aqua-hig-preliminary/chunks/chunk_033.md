A **scrolling menu** contains more items than are visible onscreen. Your application shouldn't have any scrolling menus; they should exist only when a user adds many items to a customizable menu, such as the Font menu.  
If a menu becomes too long to fit onscreen, a downward-pointing indicator appears at the bottom of the menu to show that there are more items. When the user starts to scroll, an upward-pointing indicator appears at the top of the menu to show that some items are no longer visible in that direction. When the user drags past the last visible item, the menu scrolls to show the additional items. When the last item is shown, the downward-pointing indicator disappears. This behavior happens automatically if you use the standard system menu definition procedure (MDEF).  
If the user drags back up to the top, the menu scrolls back down in the same manner. If the user leaves the menu, the next time it's opened it appears in its original state (with the indicator at the bottom), unless it is a setting, in which case, the menu displays the last user-selected item.
