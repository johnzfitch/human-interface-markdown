All spacing between dialog elements involves a multiple of 4 pixels— 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 pixels. Here are guidelines to keep in mind when laying out dialogs:  
- For most document windows that contain a single view (scrolling text or tables, for example), do not specify any space between the window edge and scroll bars (when using the Carbon Control Manager) or the frame of the view (in Interface Builder).
- For dialogs that contain a mix of controls, set 16 pixels of vertical space between controls. Try to maintain a 24-pixel space between the left and right edge of the window and any controls. Keep 20 pixels of space between the bottom edge and any controls; this can include the shadow of any push buttons in that area. Top spacing is determined by which controls are placed closest to the top of the dialog. For example, [Figure 1-25](#page-28-0) uses a pop-up menu as the topmost control, so the spacing is set to 20 pixels. In contrast, [Figure 1-26](#page-29-0) uses a tab control as the topmost element, so the spacing is set to 16 pixels.
- In general, you should try for a more center-biased approach to dialog layout, as opposed to the strongly left-biased approach of the traditional Mac OS dialog. Most of the sample layouts in this document illustrate the center-biased approach.
- Whenever possible, use additional space between controls to create groups of controls, rather than group boxes. Excessive use of group boxes creates visual clutter, as the user is distracted by too many lines and edges. Within a group box, no control or label should be positioned within 16 pixels of the box's top, bottom, left, or right borders.  
- Groups of controls should be separated by 20 pixels of vertical spacing and subgroups of controls within groups should be separated by 16 pixels.
- Vertical spacing between controls is determined by the tallest control in the row.
- Checkboxes and radio buttons are spaced 20 pixels baseline-to-baseline. Using this spacing automatically provides 7 pixels of separation between each control. For illustrations, see ["Radio Button and Checkbox Dimensions" \(page 16\)](#page-15-2) and [Figure 1-27.](#page-30-0)
- Text associated with controls like pop-up buttons, checkbox groups, and radio button groups should be spaced 8 pixels from the control.
- Bevel button spacing is based on the button's use. Toolbar bevel buttons, as used in the Finder or Mail applications, for example, are spaced 8 pixels apart. This spacing would not be appropriate for a set of smaller buttons, however. Don't overlap buttons in a palette.
- The OK or default button should be positioned in the lower-right corner of the window, dialog or alert. If you use a Cancel button, it should be positioned to the left of the default button. If you use a third, or alternate, button (Don't Save, for example), it should be positioned to the left of the Cancel button, as shown in [Figure 1-1](#page-4-0). The preferred ordering of buttons is alternate, Cancel and default. Push buttons should be spaced at least 12 pixels apart horizontally and 10 pixels apart if stacked vertically.
