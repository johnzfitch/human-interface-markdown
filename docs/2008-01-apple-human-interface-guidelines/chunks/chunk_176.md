<span id="page-160-3"></span>This chapter discusses the standard cursors available in Mac OS X and provides information on implementing your own cursors. The standard cursors are designed to provide feedback to users. To maintain a consistent user experience, it is important that you use them only for their intended purpose.  
<span id="page-160-4"></span>Each cursor has a **hot spot**—the portion of the cursor that must be positioned over a screen object before mouse clicks have an effect on the object. The hot spot should be intuitive, such as the tip of an arrow cursor or the center point of a crosshair. Screen objects have a **hot zone**—the area that the cursor's hot spot must be within in order for mouse clicks to have an effect.
