Each application and document window exists in its own layer, so documents from different applications can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the window was last accessed. When a user clicks an inactive document or chooses it from the Window menu, only that document, and any open panels, should be brought to the front. Users can bring all windows of an application forward by clicking itsicon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the application's Window menu. These actions should bring forward all of the application's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order within the application. For more information, see "The [Window](#page-185-1) Menu" (page 186).  
<span id="page-221-5"></span><span id="page-221-3"></span>Panels are always in the same layer, the top layer. They are visible only when their application is active and they float on top of any document windows in the application.  
<span id="page-221-2"></span><span id="page-221-1"></span>Users can cycle forward or backward through all open document windows by using Command-Grave Accent (Command-`) and Command-Shift-Grave Accent (Command-Shift-`). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.  
#### Main, Key, and Inactive Windows  
Windows have different looks based on how the user is interacting with them. The foremost document or application window that is the focus of the user's attention is referred to as the **main window**. The main window is often also the **key window**. The key window is the window that accepts user input, whether from the keyboard, mouse, or alternative input device. The "close window" keyboard shortcut, Command-W, targets the key window.  
However, the main window is not always the key window. There are times when a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window still remains the focus of the user's attention. For example, when a person is using an inspector, a Find dialog, or the Fonts or Colors windows, the document is the main window and the other window is the key window.  
If the main and key window are different windows, they are distinguished from one another by the look of their title bars (and toolbars, if they are present). In particular, note that the key window displays title-bar controls with color.  
Main and key windows are both active windows. An active window is visually distinct from an **inactive window** in that its title bar (and its toolbar, if there is one) displays the standard window-frame color, while the title bar (and toolbar) of an inactive window displays a lighter shade of the window-frame color. Inactive windows are windows the user has open, but that are not in the foreground. Main and key windows are always in the foreground, but only the controls of the key window have color. An active window that is not key has active, but clear, controls.  
**Note:** A transparent panel that is key displays a subtly reflective title bar and a white title, whereas a non-key transparent panel displays a darker title bar and a light gray title. See ["Transparent](#page-229-0) Panels" (page 230) for more information about transparent panels.  
<span id="page-222-0"></span>The visual distinctions between main, key, and inactive windows are shown in Figure 14-34.

#### <span id="page-222-2"></span><span id="page-222-1"></span>Click-Through  
An item that provides **click-through** is one that a user can activate on an inactive window with one click, instead of clicking first to make the window active and then clicking the item. Click-through provides greater efficiency in performing such tasks as closing or resizing inactive windows, and copying or moving files. In many cases, however, click-through could confuse a user who clicks an item unintentionally.  
Click-through is not a property of a class of controls. Any control, including toolbar items, can support click-through in many contexts, but the same control could disable click-through when its use could be destructive or difficult to reverse in a particular context.  
In an inactive window, items that do not provide click-through should appear in their disabled state. Figure 14-35 shows controls that do support click-through in an inactive window.

In a single window, you can provide click-through for any subset of items; you do not have to choose between supporting click-through for all items or none. Examine the controls in your window to see which items a user might want to activate while the window isinactive. Use the following guidelinesto help you determine which items should not support click-through.  
Don't provide click-through for an item or action that:  
- Is potentially harmful and does not allow the user to cancel it (for example, the Delete button in Mail)
- Is difficult or impossible to cancel (such as the Send button in Mail)
- Dismisses a dialog without telling the user what action was taken (for example, the Save button in a Save dialog that overwrites an existing file and automatically dismisses the dialog)
- Removes the user from the current context (for example, selecting a new item in a Finder column can change the target of the Finder window)  
Clicking in any one of these situations should result in the containing window being brought forward, but no action being taken. Figure 14-36 shows an example of a control that does not support click-through, because its action is destructive.

In general, you can implement click-through for a command that provides confirmation feedback before executing, even if the command ultimately results in destruction of data. For example, you can provide click-through for a delete button if you make sure to provide the user with the ability to cancel or confirm the action before it executes. For example, in Accounts preferences, the button for deleting users provides click-through because it also provides a confirmation dialog before executing.  
<span id="page-224-0"></span>If you want to implement click-through for an item that doesn't provide confirmation feedback, consider how difficult it will be for the user to undo the action after it's performed. For example, in Mail, the Delete button does not provide click-through because it deletes a message without providing feedback first, which is a potentially harmful action and one that is difficult to undo. Click-through for the New button in Mail is fine because its resulting action is not harmful and is easy to undo.
