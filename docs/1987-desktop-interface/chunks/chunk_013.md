Visually confusing or unattractive displays detract from the effectiveness of human-computer interactions.  
Different "things" look different on the screen.  
Users should be able to control the superficial appearance of their computer workplaces—to display their own style and individuality.

The next section summarizes some basic principles of visual design.
