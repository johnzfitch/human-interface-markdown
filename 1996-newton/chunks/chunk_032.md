Because the user's hand is usually held close to a Newton device, it's best to keep tappable controls at the bottom of the screen, have the user enter data in the middle of the screen, and display titles and other descriptors at the top of the screen. This way, the most important information (the user's information) isn't obscured each time he or she taps a button. If you need to display controls on the side, make sure your application allows users to move the controls to either side of the screen, according to whether they are right- or left-handed.
