Document windows include a **proxy icon** in the title bar after a document is saved for the first time. After pressing a proxy icon for a couple of seconds, users can manipulate it as if they were manipulating the corresponding file-system object. For example, you can attach a document to an email message by dragging its proxy icon into the email message.

<span id="page-106-2"></span>A proxy icon appears in its normal state as long as the state of the document and the file-system object are the same. When a document has unsaved changes, its proxy icon appears dimmed. Note the difference between the proxy icon in the document with unsaved changes versus the document with saved changes in Figure 8-6.
