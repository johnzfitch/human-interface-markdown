### Input

The standard Apple II input routine is common across all Apple II series computers. There are added capabilities with the mouse within the windowing metaphor, but keyboard consistency is still maintained. All professional programs should be using this input. It is available as a tool to all registered developers, with a BASIC, Pascal, and Assembly Language front end.

The user should be able to tell the rules of the input from the kind of cursor being displayed. Users are confused when the computer speaks to them in a different way in each program, but they are confounded when the computer "understands" them differently in each program.

Of all the standards and guidelines presented in this book, this is the most important: use the standard input in exactly the standard way. If you need to use an entirely different kind of input scheme, select a different cursor character, and train your users to recognize it as yet another entity. If you wish to add to its capabilities, do so, but never twist the pre-existing definition. We have trained all new users with the tutorial material shipped with each computer. They know what the input looks like and expect it to always work the same.
