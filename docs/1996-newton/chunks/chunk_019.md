Wherever possible, model the actions and objects in your program on something from the real world. This trick especially helps inexperienced users quickly grasp how your program works. Folders are a classic metaphor. People file things in folders in the real world, so they immediately understand the concept of filing data items in folders on a Newton. Other common metaphors include scrubbing to delete data, tapping buttons to make things happen, sending and receiving things through an in box and out box, setting dates and times on calendars and digital clocks, and homing in on information with alphabetic index tabs. [Figure 1-1](#page-28-0) illustrates some Newton metaphors.  
Metaphors suggest a use for objects and actions in the Newton interface, but that use doesn't define or limit the implementation of the metaphor. For example, a paper folder has a limited storage capacity, but a folder on a

Newton doesn't have to be constrained by the same limitation. Newton folders can hold a limitless number of items (up to the storage capacity of the hardware), and this is an advantage that the Newton can offer. Try to strike a balance between the metaphor's suggested use and the ability of the Newton to support and extend the metaphor.  
Naturally you can't find a metaphor for everything. Be sure to use the established metaphors, but if you can't come up with a solid metaphor for another object or action, then do without. Don't distort the real world into a caricature in a slavish attempt to find a metaphor.
