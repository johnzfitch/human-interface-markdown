The primary metaphor in the desktop interface is the desktop itself, the screen element that underlies all the rest. The desktop gives a sense of apparent stability. The desktop stays the same, for example, while the contents change; the menu categories remain constant within an application. Though the desktop has a default "pattern," the user can, through the Control Panel, change it at any time.  
The three basic subsystems of the desktop are menus, icons, and windows.
