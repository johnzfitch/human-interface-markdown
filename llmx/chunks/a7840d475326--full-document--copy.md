#### Copy

The Copy command makes a duplicate of data the user has selected. Your application puts a duplicate of the selected information on the Clipboard, but leaves the selection in the document. People use the Copy command in conjunction with the Paste command to insert duplicate data in another location.

The Command-C combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Copy command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
