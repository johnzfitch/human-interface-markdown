**Control sizes**: The dimensions of the checkbox itself are fixed for each size, but you determine the length of the introductory label and checkbox label.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Checkbox text (both the introductory label and control label) should be in a font that is proportional to the size of the control. The following fonts are supplied automatically by Interface Builder:  
■ Regular size: System font.  
- Small: Small system font.
- Mini: Mini system font.  
If you display an introductory label on the same line asthe first checkbox, use the following metricsto position it correctly:  
- Regular size: 8 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.
- Small: 6 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.
- Mini: 5 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.  
<span id="page-276-2"></span><span id="page-276-1"></span>Be sure to align the baseline of the introductory label with the baseline of the closest checkbox's label, as shown in Figure 15-25.

If you display an introductory label above a group of checkboxes, leave 8 pixels between the label and the first checkbox.  
**Control spacing**: Typically, checkboxes are arranged vertically, because this arrangement makes it easier for users to distinguish one state from another. As described in ["Checkbox](#page-274-2) Usage" (page 275), you should align a set of independent checkboxes so that all appear to be at the same level. If one checkbox describes a state or action that depends on the state of another checkbox, you can indent the dependent checkbox below the controlling one.  
Use the following metrics when you lay out checkboxes in your window:  
- Regular size: 8 pixels between controls when stacked.
- Small: 8 pixels between controls when stacked.
- Mini: 7 pixels between controls when stacked.
