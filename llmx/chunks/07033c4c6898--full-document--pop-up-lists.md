#### **Pop-Up Lists**

Pop-up lists are used in lieu of a series of radio buttons. They save screen space and prevent overcrowding in panels. Each list is controlled by a button that can be recognized by a special symbollQ, as shown below. The label on the button that precedes the symbol indicates the .current selection from the list. When the user makes a new selection, the button label changes.

Pressing the button pops the list up so that the item matching the button label appears on top of the button. The list remains up only while the user holds the mouse button down. When the user releases the mouse button after dragging to a different item in the list, the label on the button changes to that item.
