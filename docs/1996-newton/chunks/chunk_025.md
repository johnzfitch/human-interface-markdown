People make mistakes, so your program should make it easy for them to correct their mistakes. Let them use the Undo button to reverse their last action. People need to feel they can experiment without damaging the system or their data. Create safety nets for people so they feel comfortable learning and using your product.  
Always advise people when they begin an operation that has potentially dire consequences. Display a warning and have the user confirm the operation before proceeding. This doesn't mean you should have users confirm every action. Frequent warning messages suggest something is wrong with the program design—obviate some of the warnings by making more actions reversible.
