iPhone OS defines two styles of table views, which are distinguished mainly by appearance:  
**Plain** (UITableViewStylePlain). This table-view style displays rows that extend from side edge to side edge of the screen. The background of the rows is white. The rows can be separated into labeled sections and the table view can display an optional index that appears vertically along the right edge of the view.  
Figure 8-2 shows a list in a plain table (without headers, footers, or an index) in the iPod application.

**Grouped** (UITableViewStyleGrouped). This table-view style displays groups of rows that are inset from the side edges of the screen. The groups are displayed on a distinctive vertically striped background, while inside the groups the background is white. A grouped table can contain an arbitrary number of groups, and each group can contain an arbitrary number of rows. Each group can be preceded by header text and followed by footer text. This style of table view does not provide an index.  
Figure 8-3 shows a list in a grouped table, in which each group contains one row. This list, in the Settings application, does not include header or footer text.
