The Apple menu has been replaced with an application menu containing general application items. Note that the familiar Quit and Preference" menu items have been moved to the application menu. By introducing the application menu in the left-most position in the menu bar (in left-to-right script systems), Mac OS X creates a logical progression of menu functions:  
- The first menu (the application menu) provides items that pertain to the entire application, such as Hide and Quit.
- The second menu (the File menu) provides items for managing an individual document file, such as Open and Close Window.
- The third menu (the Edit menu) and all subsequent menus provide items for managing document content, such as Cut and Paste.  
An optional Window menu has also been introduced to aid in managing multiple documents open within an application.
