Open opens an existing document. To select the document, the user is presented with a dialog box (Figure 18). This dialog box shows a list of all the documents on the disk whose name is displayed that can be handled by the current application. The user can scroll this list forward and backward. The dialog box also gives the user the chance to look at the documents on other disks in other disk drives that belong to the current application.

Using the Open command, the user can only open a document that can be processed by the current application. Opening a document that can only be processed by a different application requires leaving the application.  
This command is disabled when the maximum number of documents allowed by the application is already open.
