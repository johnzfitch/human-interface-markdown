If a user types more quickly than the Newton system can handle, the system queues the extra keystrokes for later processing. This queuing is called **type-ahead.** There's a limit to the number of keystrokes that can be queued, but this limit is usually not reached unless the user types while an application is performing a lengthy operation.  
<span id="page-204-0"></span>When a user holds the pen on a key for a certain amount of time, the system acts as if the user were repeatedly tapping that key. This feature, called **auto-repeat,** affects character keys and modifier keys alike. Auto-repeat does not function during type-ahead. It operates only when the Newton system is ready to accept typing.
