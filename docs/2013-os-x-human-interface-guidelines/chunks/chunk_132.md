A **panel** is an auxiliary window that contains controls and options that affect the active document or selection. An app-wide toolbar in its own window is also called a **tool panel** or, less frequently, a **tool palette**.  
Panels are either app-specific or systemwide. App-specific panels float on top of the app's windows and disappear when the app is deactivated. Systemwide panels, such as the Colors window and the Fonts window, float on top of all open windows. (To learn more about the Colors window, see "The Colors [Window"](#page-85-0) (page 86); to learn more about the Fonts window, see "The Fonts [Window"](#page-86-0) (page 87).)  
Most panels are standard panels, which means that they use the same textures in the window body and title bar that a standard window does. Also, a standard panel tendsto use small versions of the standard UI controls. A few panels are translucent, which means that they use a dark, translucent texture in the window body and title bar, and they use small white and gray UI elements. You can see a few examples of different types of panels in the figure below.

**In general, use a standard panel.** For some apps, such as highly visual, immersive apps, transparent panels can be appropriate, but for most apps, standard panels are best. Users don't expect to see a transparent panel unless it contains image adjustment tools or it is displayed by an immersive app that uses a dark UI. To learn more about when transparent panels are appropriate, and how to design one, see ["Transparent](#page-208-0) Panels" (page 209).  
**Use a panel to give users easy access to important controls or information that directly affects their task.** For example, you can create a modeless panel, such as a tools panel, to offer controls or settings that affect the active document window. Because panels take up screen space, however, don't use them when you can meet the need by using a popover, a modeless dialog, or by adding a few appropriate controls to a toolbar.  
**Hide and show panels appropriately.** When a user makes a document active, all of the app's panels should be brought to the front, regardless of which document was active when the user opened the panel. When an app is inactive, its panels should be hidden.  
Panels should not be listed in the Window menu as documents, but you can put commands to show or hide all panels in the Window menu.  
**Make sure a panel includes a title bar.** Even if a panel doesn't need a title, it should have a title bar so that users can drag it.  
**Avoid including an active minimize button in a panel.** A user should not need to minimize a panel because it is displayed only when needed and disappears when its app is inactive. Instead, a panel should include the close and zoom buttons or, more commonly, only the close button. The correct configurations are shown below, followed by some incorrect configurations.

#### <span id="page-207-0"></span>Inspectors  
An **inspector** is a panel that allows users to view the attributes of a selection. Inspectors (sometimes called inspector windows) can also provide ways to modify these attributes. Pages, Keynote, and Preview are just a few of the apps that use inspectors (an inspector window in Numbers is shown below).  
![](images/_page_207_Picture_5.jpeg)  
**Ensure that an inspector updates dynamically based on the current selection.** Users expect an inspector's view to always be up to date. Similarly, they expect the changes they make in an inspector to immediately affect their content. Contrast this behavior with that of an Info window, which shows the attributes of the item that was selected when the window was opened, even after the focus has been changed to another item. Also, an Info window is not a panel; it islisted in the app's Window menu and it does not hide when the app becomes inactive.  
You can provide both inspectors and Info windows in your app, because in some cases users want to have one window in which context changes with each new item they select (an inspector) and in other cases users want to be able to see the attributes of more than one item at the same time (a set of Info windows). Note that users can open multiple inspector windows and Info windows in the same app at the same time.  
#### <span id="page-208-0"></span>Transparent Panels  
A **transparent panel** gives users a way to make quick adjustments to their content or task without being distracted from their work. Although the behavior of a transparent panel issimilar to the behavior of a standard panel, its appearance is designed to complement apps that focus on highly visual content or that provide an immersive experience, such as a full-screen slide show. For example, iMovie provides a transparent panel that enables users to adjust several settings in the movie.  
![](images/_page_208_Picture_4.jpeg)  
**Have a good reason to use a transparent panel instead of a standard panel.** Users can be distracted or confused by a transparent panel when there is no logical reason for its presence. In general, you should use transparent panels only when at least one of the following statements is true:  
- Your app is media-centric, that is, focused on movies, photos, or slides.
- Users use your app in a dark environment or in an immersion mode (frequently, this type of app also uses a dark, custom UI).
- Users make only quick adjustments in the panel and dismiss it quickly.  
● A standard panel would obscure the content that users need to adjust.  
**Use a combination of standard and transparent panels, if appropriate.** If your app focuses on highly visual content only at specific times or only in some modes, use the panel type that is best suited to the current task and environment. For example, the Keynote inspector allows user to setslide transitions, edit tables and graphs, and make complex adjustmentsto text and formatting. Keynote uses a standard panel for the inspector because none of its functions are focused solely on adjustments to media.  
But Keynote also provides an image-adjustment panel, which helps users make simple adjustments to slide images. The image-adjustment panel istransparent, because users use it while they are focusing on the image, watching the effect of the adjustments they make.  
![](images/_page_209_Picture_4.jpeg)  
**Don't change a panel's type when your app changes its mode.** For example, if you use a transparent panel when your app is in an immersive mode, don't transform it into a standard panel when your app switches to a nonimmersive mode.  
**As much as possible, use simple adjustment controls in a transparent panel.** In particular, you want to avoid using controls that require users to type or to select items, because these controls force users to shift their attention from their content to the panel. Instead, consider using controlssuch assliders and steppers, because they're easy for users to use without focusing on them.  
**Use white controls with gray accents and white or gray text in a transparent panel.** Light-colored controls and text are easier for users to see on the dark translucent background of a transparent panel. And, as users focus on the content behind the panel, the white text and controls appear to be floating above it.  
**Use color sparingly.** In the dark UI of a transparent panel, too much color can lessen its impact and distract users. Often, you only need small amounts of color to enhance the information you provide in a transparent panel. For example, the morsels of color in the Keynote image adjustment panel (shown in above) communicate ranges in white balance and exposure, in addition to color-specific settings, in a clear and unobtrusive way. Make sure that these small amounts of color have high contrast so that they look good on the dark translucent background.  
**In general, keep transparent panels (and their contents) small.** Transparent panels are designed to be unobtrusively useful, so allowing them to grow too big defeats their primary purpose. You don't want a transparent panel to obscure the content that the user is trying to adjust, and you don't want it to compete with the content for the user's attention.  
#### <span id="page-210-0"></span>About Windows  
An **About window**, also called an About box, is an optional window that displays your app's version and copyright information. The Finder About window is shown here.  
![](images/_page_210_Picture_7.jpeg)  
Unlike other windows, an About window combinessome of the behaviors of panels and windows: Like a panel, an About window is not listed in the app's Window menu and like a window, it remains visible when the app is inactive.  
An About window should be modeless so the user can leave it open and perform other tasks in the app. If you decide to provide an About window, be sure that it:  
- Has a title bar with no title
- Is movable
- Includes the close button as the only active window control
- Displays your app icon
- Includes the full app name and version number (the version number should be the same as the version number displayed by the Finder)
- Includes copyright information, technical support contact information, a brief description of what the app does  
**Use buttons in an About window if you want to give users a way to contact you.** For example, you might provide a button that opens your website in a browser window or opens a blank email message that is pre-addressed to you. Of course, it's best to provide most of your company contact information in the first page of your help documentation (for more information on Help menu items,see "The Help [Menu"](#page-157-0) (page 158)).  
<span id="page-211-0"></span>**Consider putting branding elements, such as logos or slogans, in your About window.** An About window isthe appropriate place for these elements because users expect it to provide information about your company and product. It's best to avoid putting such elements in document windows and dialogs.
