To signal interactivity, the built-in apps use a variety of cues, including color, location, context, and meaningful icons and labels. Usersrarely need additional decorationsto show them that an onscreen element isinteractive or to suggest what it does.

A key color gives users a strong visual indicator of interactivity, especially in appsthat don't use an abundance of other colors. In Contacts, blue marks the interactive elements and gives the app a unified and recognizable visual theme.  
The back button uses several cues to indicate its interactivity and convey its function: It appears in response to navigation, it displays a back-pointing chevron and a title that describes the previous screen, and it typically uses a key color.

An icon or a title that provides a clear call to action invites users to tap it. For example, the titles in Maps, such as "Add Bookmark" and "Directions to Here," clearly describe actions that users can take. Combined with a key color, actionable titles tend to make button borders or other embellishments superfluous.  
**In a content area, add a button border or background only if necessary.** Buttons in bars, action sheets, and alerts don't need borders because users know that most of the items in these areas are interactive. In a content area, on the other hand, a button might need a border or a background to distinguish it from the rest of the content. For example, Music, Clock, Photos, and App Store use bordered buttons in a few specific contexts.

Photos uses a button border to differentiate the Create New Stream button from the explanatory text that appears above it.  
Clock uses button bordersin the Stopwatch and Timerscreens to draw attention to the Start and Pause buttons and to make them easy to tap even when the user's surroundings are distracting.

App Store uses a button border in a table row to emphasize the distinction between tapping the row to get more information and tapping the button to initiate a purchase.
