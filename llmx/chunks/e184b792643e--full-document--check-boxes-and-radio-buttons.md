#### Check Boxes and Radio Buttons

Whereas buttons perform instantaneous or continuous actions, check boxes and radio buttons let the user choose among alternative values for a parameter.

Check boxes act like toggle switches (comparable to the text attributes in the Style menu). Check boxes are used to indicate the state of a parameter that must be either off or on. The parameter is on if the box is checked; otherwise it's off. The check boxes appearing together in a given context are independent of each other—any number of them can be off or on.

Radio buttons typically occur in groups. They're called radio buttons because they act like the buttons on a car radio. They're mutually exclusive—at any given time, exactly one button in the group is on. Clicking one button in a group turns whichever button was on before.

Both check boxes and radio buttons are accompanied by text that identifies what each button does.
