iPhone OS provides a few buttons for use in table rows and other elements. These buttons, described in Table 10-4, should be used semantically correctly, as with all standard buttons and icons. In particular, avoid choosing a button based on its appearance, without regard for its documented meaning. See ["Using](#page-122-1) [System-Provided](#page-122-1) Buttons and Icons" (page 123) for a discussion of the reasons why it'simportant to use these buttons correctly.  
Although the detail disclosure button is usually used in table rows, it can be used elsewhere. For more information about this button, see "Detail [Disclosure](#page-109-0) Buttons" (page 110). iPhone OS also provides a set of controls for use in table rows only; for more information about these, see ["Table-View](#page-97-0) Elements" (page 98).  
<span id="page-126-1"></span>For more information on symbol names and availability for these buttons, see documentation for UIButtonType. (For information on the symbol name and availability for the detail disclosure table-view element, see documentation for UITableViewCellAccessoryDetailDisclosureButton.)
