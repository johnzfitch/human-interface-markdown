Meeting the minimum requirements and delivering features users expect takes you a long way towards producing an application that users in your target market will be eager to buy. Although the top layer of the pyramid represents more work, the result is a user-acclaimed application that takes full advantage of the powerful features of Mac OS X.  
Follow the guidelinesin thissection to produce an application that goes above and beyond users' expectations.  
● Support modelessness.  
As much as possible, avoid forcing the user to complete the current task before they can do anything else. Use sheets and drawers to allow the user more freedom (for more information about sheets and drawers, see "Sheets [\(Document-Modal](#page-235-1) Dialogs)" (page 236) and ["Drawers"](#page-213-0) (page 214)). If you must use modes in your application, be sure to clearly communicate the current status and make it easy for users to get into and out of a mode.  
● Integrate Spotlight.  
Spotlight technology allows users to find files anywhere in the system, using criteria they define. Be sure to supply a Spotlight importer if your application uses a custom file format, so users can easily search for the files your application creates. In addition, you should consider using Spotlight technology to provide file system search capabilities in your application. For more information about Spotlight, see ["Spotlight"](#page-77-1) (page 78).  
● Support fast user switching.  
Mac OS X allows multiple users to use a single computer at the same time. With fast user switching, one user's login session is active while the sessions of other users continue to run in the background. Users switch simply by logging in; logging out between users is not required. Applications should take this feature into account to avoid failing in a multiple, simultaneous user environment. If your application relies on exclusive accessto resources or assumesthere is only one instance of a per-userservice running at any one time, be sure to modify the application to safely identify and share system resources. For more information on how to support fast user switching, see *Multiple User Environments*.  
● Internationalize the user interface.  
The global market for your application is defined by the extent to which itsupportslocale-specific content and functionality. As you design or revise your application, be aware of differences in language and cultural values and symbols so you can more easily localize your product for specific markets. For more information on internationalization issues, see "Worldwide [Compatibility"](#page-46-1) (page 47).  
● Make your application accessible to users with disabilities.  
To reach the millions of users with disabilities (and to comply with government-mandated accessibility requirementsin some markets), you should ensure that your application is accessible. Mac OS X supports accessibility with a range of powerful features, including full keyboard access, speech technologies, and VoiceOver, an integrated accessibility interface to the Macintosh. You should test your application with these features to make sure that the application does not interfere with them and potentially degrade a disabled user's experience. For an overview of accessibility issues, see "Universal [Accessibility"](#page-48-0) (page 49).  
● Strive for high performance and reliability.  
Even a stunning user interface is not likely to be enough to persuade usersto continue using an application that performs poorly or behavesin a counterintuitive and unreliable way. Remember that the perception of performance is informed by two things: The speed with which an application processes data and performs operations and the speed with which the application responds to the user. Take advantage of the tools and optimization technologies Mac OS X provides to enhance the performance of your application. Be sure your application responds quickly and keeps the user informed about the progress of lengthy tasks. For more information on some techniques for achieving high performance, see ["High](#page-30-1) [Performance"](#page-30-1) (page 31).  
Users will be quick to reject your application if it loses or corrupts data or behaves erratically. Build in as many safeguards against data loss as you can and be sure to warn users about potential problems, allowing them to make alternate choices that avoid risky situations. Although unpredictable behavior may not lead to data loss, it can cause users to distrust an application. Make sure the user interface elements in your application behave in an expected and desired way so users can trust your application to do what it promises. For more information on ways to make your application reliable, see ["Reliability"](#page-33-1) (page 34).  
● Surprise and delight.  
Although less concrete than the other guidelines, this guideline encompassessome of the most important qualities of great software. Fundamentally, users delight in applications that seem to understand them, anticipating their needs and providing them with powerful, intuitive, and streamlined solutions. The best way to follow this guideline is to keep the user's mental model firmly in mind as you design your application (for a discussion of this concept, see ["Reflect](#page-38-3) the User's Mental Model" (page 39)). Briefly, you should discover your users' workflow, expectations, and real-world experiences and mirror them in your application's terminology, window layout, menu organization and hierarchy, and toolbar contents.
