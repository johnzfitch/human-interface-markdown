The primary unifying metaphor in the Apple Desktop Interface is the desktop itself. It provides a sense of apparent stability, remaining constant while its content changes.

Desktop icons are graphic representations of such things as disks, folders, applications, documents, and the trash can, as shown in Figure 11.

Five kinds of Finder icons  
Icons contribute greatly to the clarity and attractiveness of an application. The use of icons in addition to (or instead of) words can also make it easier to translate programs into other languages, except where the icons have different meanings in different cultures. An item is easier to remember when it's represented by an icon with text than if it's represented by either an icon alone or text alone. Wherever an explanation or label is needed, consider using an icon.  
The two basic subsystems of the desktop are the **windows** that provide flexible display of information, and the **menus** (including palettes) that make many operations immediately available.  
#### Windows  
The way the user accesses the document is through a window. A window is a view into the document—if the document is larger than the window, the window is a view of a portion of the document. The application puts one or more windows on the screen, each window showing a view of a document or of auxiliary information used in processing the document.  
Generally, it is unwise to allow multiple windows for the same document. It confuses the relationship of windows to icons ("which window do I close to close the document?"). If multiple views are desirable, the window can be split.  
There are several kinds of windows. Standard document windows are the most obvious kind, but dialog and alert boxes are technically windows too. Most of this section deals with document windows; dialogs and alerts are discussed together at the end of this section. Because controls appear only in windows, they are also discussed in this section.  
This section is about a window's structural components, or window frame. For a standard document window, these include the title bar, size box, close box, zoom box, and scroll bars. The application determines the *content* of the window.
