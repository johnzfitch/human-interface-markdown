## Access Privileges

Collaborative products typically allow users to share data with other people, providing different access rights to different people. For example, one user may want to allow some people to change a document and allow other people simply to read it. The owner may want to restrict some people from seeing the document at all.

Provide a simple, clear way to assign access privileges to shared information and then clearly display to users what those assigned privileges are. One typical problem with multi-user programs is that they have an interface that makes it easy to provide unintentional access to other users without making this mistake apparent. Try to avoid this compromised security state by making it clear to users what information is shared and available to others.
