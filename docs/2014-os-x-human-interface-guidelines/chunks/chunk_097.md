A preferences window is a modeless dialog that containssettingsthat the user changesinfrequently. In general, the user opens a preferences window to change the default way an app displays an item or performs a task, then closes the window, and expects the new settings to have taken effect. To provide a good preferences experience in your app, see [Preferences](#page-263-0) (page 264).  
Often, a preferences window has a toolbar that contains items that function as pane switchers. When the user clicks an item in this type of toolbar, the content area of the preferences window switches to display a different view, called a **pane**. This design is useful for apps that need to provide multiple settings in each of several different categories. For example, the Safari preferences window contains a toolbar that allows user to choose among categories of settings, such as bookmarks, appearance, and RSS.

**Don't enable customization of a pane-switcher toolbar in a preferences window.** A pane-switcher toolbar in a preferences window does not provide a shortcut to frequently used commands, but instead acts as a convenient way to group settings. If users customize thistype of toolbar, they might forget that hidden settings are still available. For the same reason, it makes sense to disable the ability to hide the toolbar in a preferences window, too.  
**Maintain the selected appearance of an item in a pane-switcher toolbar.** When the user clicks an item in a pane-switcher toolbar, the window displays a different pane. It's important to indicate which item is currently selected by maintaining the item's selected appearance. For example, in the Safari preferences window, you can see the background highlighting that indicates the Tabs item is the active one.

**Don't allow resizing or include active minimize or zoom buttons in a preferences window.** Remember that preferences windows are intended to give users a place to make occasional adjustments to the way an app behaves, so there should be no need for a preferences window to be resized or to remain open for a long time.  
**Use the title of the current pane to title the preferences window.** The preferences window title should be the same as the title of the currently selected pane even if you don't use a pane-switcher toolbar to change panes. (Note that if your preferences window does not contain multiple panes, its title should be "*App Name* Preferences".) In addition, a changeable-pane preferences window should remember which pane the user selected the last time the window was open.  
**Use the standard menu item and keyboard shortcut to open your preferences window.** Users expect most apps to include a Preferences command in the app menu. In addition, most users expect to be able to use the Command-comma keyboard shortcut to open an app's preferences window.
