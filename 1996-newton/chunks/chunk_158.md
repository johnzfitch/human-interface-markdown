When a user specifies an action that involves a transport, the transport displays a routing slip in which the user can confirm or cancel the action as well as specify additional routing information. The transport does not have to display a routing slip if a user has set transport preferences (as described in ["Transport Preferences" on page 7-32\)](#page-237-0) that make the routing slip superfluous. For example, the beam transport does not display a routing slip if a user has set beam preferences so that beamed items are always sent immediately and not held in the Out Box.  
When a user chooses an application-defined action from below the separator line in an Action picker and the action might result in a loss of data, the application displays either a special routing slip or a confirmation alert (see ["Confirmation Alerts" on page 2-18](#page-61-0)). For example, the built-in applications display a confirmation alert if a user chooses the Delete action but not the Duplicate action.  
A routing slip serves the same purpose as—and even resembles—an airmail envelope and its contents. The top part of a routing slip looks like an envelope (thereby extending the Action button's visual metaphor) and contains addressing information. In the center of the routing slip envelope is the recipient, and in the upper left corner are the name and location of the sender. Where a real envelope would have a postage stamp, a routing slip displays the name of the transport and its icon in a border that looks like a postage stamp. To complete the look, the top part of a routing slip has square corners and a diagonally striped border, just like an airmail envelope. Extending below the routing slip envelope is a panel that represents what is being sent. This lower panel has controls for canceling or completing the routing action, and may have additional interface elements that affect the format and content of what is sent. [Figure 7-8](#page-218-0) shows a sample routing slip.

The system animates the display of a routing slip. First the envelope panel appears to slide onto the screen from the right. Then the lower panel appears to slide out of the envelope.  
A routing slip is part of a transport, not part of an application. A transport uses a routing slip to get all the user-supplied information necessary to send an item. Because a transport provides the user interface for its routing slip, an application does not need to know anything about what is required to send an item via that transport.  
#### Sender Picker 7  
The sender's name and location displayed in the upper left corner of a routing slip are actually the label of a picker. Tapping the label pops up a Sender picker, from which a user can choose a different sender name or worksite. [Figure 7-9](#page-219-0) illustrates the Sender picker.  
<span id="page-219-0"></span>**Figure 7-9** Changing the sender's name or location  
![](images/_page_219_Picture_3.jpeg)  
The Sender picker lists the owner names and worksites that have been entered in the built-in Owner Info application. The last item in the Sender picker, Other City, brings up a picker from which a user can choose another city. Choosing another city for the sender in a routing slip automatically makes that city the home city in the Time Zones application.  
If a user chooses a different owner, worksite, or city, the system updates the routing information as needed. For example, in a Fax routing slip the system prefixes the destination fax number with a 1 and the area code only if a user chooses a worksite or city with a different area code. The system doesn't add a 1 or the area code if the sender's worksite has the same area code as the destination.  
The default owner name (or **persona,** as it is sometimes called) shown by this picker is the one corresponding to the last-used owner name for a routing operation. The default worksite for the owner is the one corresponding to the last worksite used for a routing operation (including a canceled routing operation) or the setting of the home location in the Time Zones application, whichever was done last. Note that users can create additional owner names and worksites in the Owner Info application, and they can add cities to the Time Zones application.  
Some transports need the sender's return address as well as the sender's name. The transport extracts any return address information it needs, such as the sender's fax number or e-mail address, from the sender's card in the Owner Info application.  
#### <span id="page-220-0"></span>Recipient Pickers 7  
The kind of recipient information displayed in the center of a routing slip envelope depends on the kind of transport involved. For printing, the recipient is the model or name of the printer to use. For faxing or e-mail, the recipient is a name and fax number or e-mail address taken from the Names File. For beaming, the recipient is any device with a compatible infrared port.  
Print, fax, and e-mail transports should display the name of the recipient as a picker label. A user can tap the name to pop up a People picker in which to select different recipients. The built-in beam transport does not need to specify a particular recipient; it displays a generic recipient that a user does not change. For a description of People pickers, see ["People Picker" on](#page-152-0)  [page 4-27](#page-152-0).  
#### Choosing a Printer 7  
When a user taps the printer named in the center of a print routing slip, a list picker pops up. The picker lists printers that a user has recently chosen, along with items that allow the user to choose a different printer. The user can choose to select a network printer or other printer. If a user chooses to select a network printer and is connected to a network, the system displays a list of printers it finds on the network. If the user chooses to select a non-network printer, the system displays a list of printers for which driver software is installed on the Newton device. [Figure 7-10](#page-221-0) illustrates the process of choosing a printer.  
**Figure 7-10** Choosing a printer in a routing slip  
<span id="page-221-0"></span>![](images/_page_221_Figure_3.jpeg)  
#### Choosing Fax or E-mail Recipients 7  
The recipient in a fax or e-mail routing slip is a picker label. Tapping it pops up a picker that lists names a user has recently chosen, along with an Other Names item. The user can select a recipient from the picker list, or the user can tap Other Names to select different recipients from a People picker. A fax transport's routing slip generally has only one field for recipients, labeled Name. An e-mail transport's routing slip may have three fields for recipients, labeled To, Cc, and Bcc. The To field identifies primary recipients; the Cc (carbon copy) field identifies secondary recipients; and the Bcc (blind carbon  
copy) field identifies recipients whose names and addresses are hidden from To and Cc recipients. Figure 7-11 illustrates the process of choosing fax or e-mail recipients.  
**Figure 7-11** Choosing fax or e-mail recipients in a routing slip  
![](images/_page_222_Figure_4.jpeg)  
<span id="page-223-0"></span>The very first time a user taps the recipient in a fax or e-mail routing slip, the picker that lists recently used names does not appear because no names have been used yet. Instead, a People picker appears immediately, listing possible recipients from the Names File.  
#### Transport Picker 7  
A transport displays its name and icon (dressed as a postage stamp) in the upper right corner of its routing slip. If there is more than one transport for the type of routing action chosen from the Action picker, the transport name is a picker label. Tapping it pops up a picker from which a user can choose any transport in the group.

![](images/_page_223_Picture_8.jpeg)  
2. Picker pops up, listing all transports of the same type  
When a user switches to another transport in a group, the system closes and reopens the routing slip because each transport (not each group of transports) specifies its own routing slip. The system remembers the most recently chosen transport in a group and uses that transport if a user later chooses the same routing action from an Action picker.  
#### Send Button and Close Box 7  
Every routing slip has a large Close box in its lower right corner. If a user taps a routing slip's Close box, the routing slip closes with a visual effect of quickly sliding off the screen to the right. Nothing else happens.  
<span id="page-224-0"></span>To the left of the Close box is a text button labeled with the name of the routing action.Tapping this text button, which is known as the Send button, closes the routing slip, but with different animation than the Close box. First the lower panel slides up, as if it were going into the envelope part of the routing slip. Then the envelope slides off the screen to the right.  
In addition to the routing slip closing, one of three things happens when a user taps a Send button. The outgoing item may be placed in the Out Box and sent immediately. The item may be placed in the Out Box and held there until a user sends it. Or a picker may pop up, giving the user the choice of sending now or later. Customarily a transport allows users to control which of those three alternatives happens by setting preferences in the In/Out Box application, as described in ["Transport Preferences" on page 7-32](#page-237-0).  
A transport can also force the button to send now or later without displaying a picker. This overrides any preferences setting a user may have made for the transport.  
When saving items in the Out Box for later transmission, a transport has to determine when it should get information from the sender's owner and worksite cards. Although this issue doesn't affect the user interface visibly, the issue does affect stability and consistency as they appear to users. In general, the transport should get information from the sender's owner card at the time the item is sent to the Out Box. Such information might include the sender's name, return address (such as fax number or e-mail address), credit card information, and so on.  
However, if the transport uses worksite information to make a connection (for example, to determine how to dial the recipient's fax number), the transport should wait to obtain the most current information—based on the user's current worksite setting—until the item is actually transmitted from the Out Box, and make necessary adjustments at that time. For example, if a user queued several fax items at home but didn't send them until at work, the transport might need to change the area code information for dialing the recipient's fax number.  
#### <span id="page-225-0"></span>Other Routing Slip Elements 7  
A routing slip's lower panel may have additional controls and pickers that affect what is sent and how it is sent. The system includes a Format picker if there is more than one format for the class of data being sent. A transport may include additional pickers, buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and other interface elements that users may need to prepare the routing action. For example, the built-in fax transport includes six additional interface elements: a picker, two checkboxes, and three buttons. Figure 7-13 shows the interface elements in the lower panel of a Fax routing slip.

![](images/_page_225_Picture_5.jpeg)  
#### Format Picker 7  
A routing slip's Format picker lists all the routing formats that apply to the outgoing item or items. For example, five formats might apply when faxing an item, while only one format applies when beaming. [Figure 7-14](#page-226-0) shows the variety of format choices available in several built-in applications on an Apple MessagePad 120.  
**Figure 7-14** Format choices vary by transport and class of data  
<span id="page-226-0"></span>![](images/_page_226_Figure_3.jpeg)  
Although a transport specifies most items in its routing slip, it does not determine which formats to list in a Format picker. The system builds a Format picker each time it displays a routing slip, and it determines which formats to list based on the transport and the class of data being routed.  
<span id="page-227-0"></span>Each application defines routing formats for its classes of data and registers the formats with the system. Typically, an application defines several routing formats so that users have a choice of routing actions. For example, an application might define two formats for printing and faxing image data, one format for beaming or e-mailing structured data, and another format for e-mailing text data. If two or more applications happen to define routing formats for the same class of data, the system makes all those formats available whenever a user routes that class of data in any of the applications.  
Any format can specify an auxiliary view for getting supplemental information from the user. When a user chooses that format, the system displays the auxiliary view. For example, choosing the Letter format when printing or faxing an individual note in the Notepad application brings up a slip in which the user supplies the addressee and indicates whether to include the ink text signature. Figure 7-15 illustrates that example.  
**Figure 7-15** A format can get supplemental information in an auxiliary view

<sup>1.</sup> User chooses Letter format when faxing a Notepad item  
![](images/_page_227_Picture_7.jpeg)  
2. Letter format displays a slip requesting additional information  
<span id="page-228-0"></span>Each time a routing slip opens, the system initially sets the format to the format most recently used for the transport and class of data. If the class of data has never been routed through the transport before, the system makes the initially selected format the first format it finds.  
#### Preview Button 7  
A transport that routes page images should allow users to preview the pages from its routing slip. The built-in print and fax transports do that by including a Preview button in the lower left corner of their routing slips, aligned with the large Close box in the opposite corner. Tapping the Preview button displays a large slip containing a reduced image of one outgoing page. The slip contains a Next button for advancing to the next page and a large Close box for closing the slip. Figure 7-16 shows an example of a Preview slip.
