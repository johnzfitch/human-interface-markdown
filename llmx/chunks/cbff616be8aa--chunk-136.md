<!-- Chunk 136 | Source: 1986-12 Human Interface Guidelines (Final Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 163 -->
Although the use of sound in the Desktop Interface hasn't been investigated thoroughly, these are some general guidelines to keep in mind.  
Don't go overboard  
Be thoughtful about where and how you use sound in an application. If you overuse sound, it won't add any meaning to the interface, and will probably just be annoying.  
Redundancy  
Sound should never be the only indication that something has happened; there should always be a visible indication on the screen, too, especially when the user needs to know what happened. The user may have all sound turned off, may have been out of hearing range of the computer, or may be hard of hearing.
