### Always provide a way out

Because the Apple Desktop Interface encourages users to be active, they often request something they don't really want. To encourage such deliberate (though often unplanned) activities and to give users a sense of control over these activities, programmers should make actions reversible whenever possible. Users should, for example, be able to cancel activities easily, particularly those that are unexpectedly involved. They should also have a range of deliberate choices to confirm that they do want to do something particularly drastic, complex, or time-consuming.
