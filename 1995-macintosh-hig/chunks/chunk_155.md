Another purpose for using a modeless dialog box is to complete an action begun with a command in a menu. In this case the user gives additional information to the application in a modeless dialog box. The information might consist of additional parameters to the command, such as, "Do the task . . . in this way." The user might give specific information that an operation needs. For example, with the command that allows a user to search for words in a document, the user needs a place to type the word or characters being searched for, as shown in Figure 6-6.  
**Figure 6-6** Provide a place for the user to enter information in a modeless dialog box

Modeless dialog boxes should be dynamic in nature, updating the document continuously while open. If the dialog box for a particular feature is not designed to interact dynamically with the user, you might think about implementing that feature in a modal dialog box.
