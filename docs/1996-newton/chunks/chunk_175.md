Your application can easily associate a sound with a system event or play sound on demand. Each sound can be played synchronously, so that other tasks must wait for it to finish, or asynchronously, so that another task can begin before the sound finishes. The Newton system includes a number of built-in sounds, which the built-in applications use and other applications can use as well. Newtons play only sampled (recorded or prefabricated) sounds; the Newton system does not synthesize sound.  
The built-in applications and transports use sounds extensively but unobtrusively to provide secondary feedback and enrich the user experience. Sound should always play a secondary role in Newton software. Don't make sound the sole conveyer of information. For users who must turn the sound off or who are hearing-impaired, your application should convey vital information visually as well.
