This is used to open an existing document. To select *which* document, the user is presented with a dialog box. This dialog box shows a list of all the documents, on the disk whose name is displayed, that can be handled by the current application.

Figure 25. Open Dialog Box  
In the case of Macintosh's ROM-based Hierarchical File System (HFS), the user also has the opportunity to browse through various folders, or subdirectories. The user can scroll this list forward and backward. The dialog box also gives the user the chance to look at documents on another disk or to eject a disk.  
Using Open, the user can open only a document that can be processed by the current application. To open a document that can be processed only by some other application, the user must ordinarily leave the application and return to the Finder.  
When an application starts up by putting an empty untitled document on the screen, the Open option can remain enabled (not dimmed) even if the application allows only one open document at a time. In this case, selecting Open from the File menu simultaneously closes the empty document (why save an empty document?) and opens another.
