Indicators are controls that show users the status of something. For the most part, users don't interact with indicators.  
**Important:** The controls described in this section are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the window-frame areas. See ["Window-Frame](#page-248-1) Controls" (page 249) for controls designed specifically for use in the toolbar and bottom-bar areas in your window.
