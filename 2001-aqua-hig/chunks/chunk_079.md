- choosing a file from an Open dialog
- choosing the New command from the File menu  
<span id="page-70-3"></span><span id="page-70-1"></span>When your application displays a new document window, name it "untitled"; leaving it lowercase makes it more obvious that the window doesn't have a name and encourages people to save the document.  
<span id="page-70-2"></span>If the user chooses New again before saving the first untitled window, name the second window "untitled 2," and so on. Add numbers to window titles only when there is more than one open untitled window. Don't put a "1" on the first untitled window, even after the user opens other new windows. If the user dismisses all untitled windows by saving or closing them, then the next new document should start over as "untitled," the next should be "untitled 2," and so on.

<span id="page-71-2"></span>When the user opens an existing document, display its name exactly as it appears in the Finder.  
<span id="page-71-1"></span>**Note:** In Mac OS X 10.1, filename extensions (".jpg," for example) are, by default, not visible to users, but a user can choose to show extensions on all filenames or on a particular document. The document title in the title bar should display the filename extension when the user has chosen to show it. Existing documents should retain their filenames; don't add or remove a filename extension until the user chooses Save As.
