## Style menu

Text-oriented application programs, such as word processors, have a Style menu. (See Figure 43.)

Figure 43 Standard Style menu

The operations in the standard Style menu are Plain text, Bold, Italic, Underline, Outline, and Shadow. Others that can be included here are superscript, subscript, small caps, uppercase, and lowercase. All except Plain Text are accumulating attributes. This means that the user can choose all of them, none of them, or any combination of them. It is important that each attribute can be individually toggled on and off. The user who has accumulated several attributes (bold, italic, and underline for example) and wants to eliminate bold and italic while keeping underline doesn't want to have to choose Plain (which turns off all three attributes) then start over by choosing underline.

An attribute that's in effect for the current selection is preceded, in the Style menu, by a check mark. The absence of the check mark indicates that the attribute is not in effect for the current selection. Choosing Plain Text cancels all the other choices.

Other menus use plain 12-point Chicago for their text, but the Style menu can be self-documenting by using, for example, shadowed 12-point Chicago to list the shadowed attribute. Apple-key combinations can be used as keyboard shortcuts to the Style menu.
