Alexander, Christopher, Sara Ishikawa, and Murray Silverstein. *A Pattern Language, Towns/Buildings/Construction.* New York: Oxford University Press, 1977.  
Bentley, Ian, and others. *Responsive Environments: A Manual for Designers.* London: Architectural Press, 1985.  
Contains design principles and examples directed toward urban designers, architects, and landscape architects. In spite of its practical orientation, the design principles—permeability, variety, legibility, robustness, visual appropriateness, richness, and personalization—can be easily transposed to the human interface domain.  
Gehl, Jan. *Life Between Buildings.* Translated by Jo Koch. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1986.  
Discusses attributes of the physical environment that make small urban spaces (for example, squares and streets) more or less supportive of human-human interaction.

Lynch, Kevin. *The Image of the City*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1960.  
A classic work that describes the author's studies of the regularities of mental maps formed by the inhabitants of three cities. His analysis of the five basic elements of city images, and the ways in which they contribute to the legibility and navigability of their environments, can be applied to a variety of representation and navigation problems within the HCI (human-computer interaction) domain.  
*Places: A Quarterly Journal of Environmental Design*. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.  
This journal is aimed at architects, urban and landscape designers, and others concerned with imbuing their designs with a sense of place. It's relevant to the field of human-computer interaction in two ways. First, understanding how the large-scale physical environment shapes human interaction can be important in the design of systems such as public information kiosks. Second, lessons about how the physical environment facilitates human interaction can be transposed to the domain of human-computer interaction. These lessons can be applied directly to the HCI domain as 3-D environments within the computer become more prevalent. The lessons also can be applied indirectly as computer interfaces–whether 2-D or 3-D–take on more of the richness and flexibility that characterize the real world.

Whyte, William H. *City: Rediscovering the Center.* New York: Anchor Books, Doubleday, 1988.  
A uniformly fascinating study of the behaviors of people in urban spaces. Focuses particular attention to the physical factors that affect human-human and human-city interaction.
