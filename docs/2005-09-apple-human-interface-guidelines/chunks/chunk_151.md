<span id="page-111-2"></span>If the user drags an item to a destination in your application, your application provides feedback that indicateswhether itwill accept that item. Destination feedbackshould not occur simplybecauseyour application is "drag-aware"; rather, it should depend on the destination's ability to accept the type of data contained in the dragged item. For example, a text entry field that accepts only text should not be highlighted when the dragged item is a graphic.  
<span id="page-111-3"></span>Use cursors to indicatewhat result lettinggo of the mousewill have.For example, ifyou are dragging an icon out of a toolbar, show the poof cursor when the user has the icon outside of the toolbar to indicate that if theyletgo of it there, the item will disappear. Other cursors that provide useful feedback during a drag operation include the alias, copy, and not allowed cursors. See ["Cursors"](#page-134-0) (page 135) for more information on the cursors available in Mac OS X.

The Drag Manager provides some utilities for simple highlighting; if your application needs more complex highlighting, you must provide your own highlighting utilities.
