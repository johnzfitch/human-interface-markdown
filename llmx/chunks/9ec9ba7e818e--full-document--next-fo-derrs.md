## **NeXT** Fo~derrs

Four of the top-level folders begin with a "Next" prefix-NextApps, NextAdmin, NextDeveloper, and NextLibrary. They contain documents, resources, and applications that are bundled with the computer.

The NextApps folder contains supported applications for NeXTSTEP users. In it are general-interest applications like Edit, Preferences, Mail, and PrintManager.

The NextAdmin folder also contains supported applications, but ones that will be used mainly by system administrators and network managers. They're not for general users like those in NextApps.

The main purpose of the NextDeveloper folder is to provide applications and files that are necessary for developing NeXTSTEP applications. Some of the folders that can appear in NextDeveloper include:

| Holds applications used by developers. This folder might not exist on<br>Apps |  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--|

all systems. Debuggers, profiling tools, language-specific editors, and other window-based programming tools belong here. Like all other applications in the four "Next" folders, these applications can be run from the Workspace Manager. Command-line debuggers and profiling

tools are in standard UNIX folders such as Ibin and lusrlbin.

Demos Contains programs that demonstrate the capabilities of NeXTSTEP.

These aren't full applications and aren't supported by NeXT. However, they include games and utilities that users, not just

developers, might find interesting.

Examples Contains source code for example programs. This folder might not

exist on all systems. Its folders contain source code that you can study

and compile.

The NextLibrary folder contains resource files organized into several folders. Some of the files and folders aren't on every system. Typical folders include

/NextLibrary/Documentation, which holds NeXTSTEP technical documentation, and /NextLibrary/Fonts, which holds the PostScript fonts available to all applications.
