Direct manipulation is an example of an implied action that allows users to feel that they are controlling the objects represented by the computer. According to this principle, an onscreen object should remain visible while a user performs an action on it, and the impact of the action should be immediately visible. For example, with a drag-and-drop operation (the most common example of direct manipulation) users can move a file by dragging its icon from one location to another, or drag selected text directly into another document. Other examples of direct manipulation are the resizing of a graphic object in a drawing app and the positioning of an object or camera view in a three-dimensional scene.  
Support direct manipulation when users are likely to expect it. Avoid forcing usersto use controlsto manipulate data. For example, an app that manages a virtual library might allow the user to drag a book icon onto a patron's name to check it out. Such direct manipulation supports the user's mental model of the task and is much more natural than opening a window, selecting a book title, selecting a patron name, and clicking a Check Out button. (For more information on the concept of a mental model, see ["Mental](#page-26-2) Model" (page 27).)
