The user moves a window by dragging any part of the window frame (for more information about the parts of a window,see "About Window [Appearance](#page-168-0) and Behavior" (page 169)). Asthe user drags a window, the entire window and its contents move. Users can drag a window from one desktop to another by dragging it to the left or the right of the screen until the current space is pushed away by the neighboring space.  
<span id="page-173-1"></span>If the user presses the Command key while dragging an inactive window, the window moves, but does not become active. For more information about active and inactive windows, see "Main, Key, and [Inactive](#page-174-0) [Windows"](#page-174-0) (page 175).  
#### Layering  
Each app and document window exists in its own layer on a desktop, so that windows and documents from different apps can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window on the desktop.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the user last accessed it. When a user clicks an inactive document or chooses it from the Window menu, only that document, and any open panel, is brought to the front.  
Users can bring all of an app's windows forward by clicking the app icon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the app's Window menu. These actions bring forward all of the app's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order within the app.  
Panels are always in the top layer. They are visible only when their app is active, and they float on top of any open document windows in the app.  
Users can view all of an app's open windows by activating App Exposé. In App Exposé view, users can choose one of the open windows on the current desktop or scroll to find an open window on a different desktop. Users can also cycle forward or backward through an app's open windows on the current desktop by using Command-Backquote (Command-`) and Command-Shift-Backquote (Command-Shift-`). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.  
#### <span id="page-174-0"></span>Main, Key, and Inactive Windows  
Windows have different appearances based on how the user is interacting with them. The foremost document or app window that is the focus of the user's attention is called the **main window**. The main window is often also the **key window**, which is the window that accepts user input. For example, the "close window" keyboard shortcut, Command-W, always targets the key window.  
Typically, the main window is also the key window, but this is not always the case. Sometimes a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window remains the focus of the user's attention. For example, a user might be working in a document window when they need to open an inspector or the Colors window to make adjustments. In this situation, the document is still the main window, but the inspector or Colors window is the key window.  
Both main and key windows are always in the foreground, but only the controls of the key window have color.  
Main and key windows are both active windows. In an **active window**, the title bar (and toolbar, if one is present) displays the standard window-frame color. An active window that is not key has active, but clear, controls.  
Inactive windows are windows the user has open, but that are not in the foreground. In an **inactive window**, the title bar (and toolbar) displays a lightershade of the window-frame color. You can see the visual distinctions between main, key, and inactive windows in the figure below.

<span id="page-175-0"></span>**Note:** A transparent panel that is key displays a subtly reflective title bar and a white title, whereas a non-key transparent panel displays a darker title bar and a light gray title. (For more information about transparent panels, see ["Transparent](#page-211-0) Panels" (page 212).)
