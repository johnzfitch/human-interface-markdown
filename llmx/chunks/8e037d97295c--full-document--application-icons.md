## **Application Icons**

Every running application is represented on-screen by an icon. This icon lets the user choose the application to work in. To choose an application, the user simply double-clicks its icon.

An application icon can be either freestanding or docked. Docked icons line up along the right edge of the screen. They stay on-screen even when the applications they represent aren't running; this makes it easy to start up commonly used applications (by double-clicking the docked icon). A freestanding icon stays on-screen only as long as the application is running. Users can customize their environment by dragging application icons into and out of the application dock.

The Workspace Manager adds three small dots—similar to an ellipsis—in the lower left corner of a docked icon when the application the icon represents isn't running. The three dots disappear when the application is started up. While it's starting up, the icon is highlighted in white, as shown above.
