Collaborative computing extends the interface from the realm of human-to-computer communication to human-to-human communication. When people communicate over a network, certain aspects of everyday social interaction, such as voice inflection, gesture, facial expressions, and body language, are lost. You can enhance people's ability to communicate clearly on the computer by supporting the ability to include contextual clues, including font styles and sizes, punctuation, colors, graphics, sounds, and animation.
