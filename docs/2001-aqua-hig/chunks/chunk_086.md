An item that provides click-through is one that a user can activate on an inactive window with one click, rather than clicking first to make the window active and then clicking the item. Click-through provides greater efficiency in performing such  
tasks as closing or resizing inactive windows, and copying or moving files. In many cases, however, click-through could confuse a user who clicks an item unintentionally.  
Click-through is not a property of a class of controls; any control could support click-through in many contexts, but the same control could disable click-through when its use could be destructive in a particular context.  
In an inactive window, an item that provides click-through has its text or glyph (such as arrows) in 100-percent black; if the item usually has color (such as a radio button), it is colorless in its click-through state. Items that do not provide click-through appear in their disabled state (50-percent dimmed).
