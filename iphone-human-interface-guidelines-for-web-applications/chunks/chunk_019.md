Consistency across user interfaces allows users to apply knowledge they've gained from other webpages and applicationsto new content. For webpages, there are many examples of good website design with which to be consistent. But for web applications, iPhone presents a different platform and a different way of doing things. With what should you be consistent?  
To the extent that you can, emulate the clean lines and layout of the built-in iPhone applications. Use a color palette that subtly unifies your content. And, where appropriate, design controls to look and behave like the controls in the built-in iPhone applications. See "Metrics, Layout [Guidelines,](#page-30-0) and Tips" (page 31) for some specific guidelines to help you do these things.  
For example, the World Clock function of the built-in Clock application (shown in Figure 3-6) uses the same style of button and the same fonts and font attributes used in many other built-in applications. In addition, World Clock displays the user-selected locations in a scrollable list, which works like the lists in other built-in applications. Consistency of appearance and function helps users know what to expect when they tap a button or see a list.

Consistency within a user interface is at least asimportant as consistency with other user interfaces. Remember that iPhone users don't want to spend time discovering and working around the idiosyncrasies of your user interface; they want to be able to use your content as soon as they view it on iPhone. Therefore, you should reward their attention by ensuring that controls and features work as users have learned to expect.  
If, for example, you use the same control to perform different actions, you make it impossible for users to apply what they've learned from their earlier encounter with the control and predict the outcome of their gesture. Because iPhone users may have little patience with an application that doesn't behave consistently, an inconsistent user interface can alienate your audience.
