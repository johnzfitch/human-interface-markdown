Every application needs an application icon and a launch image. It's recommended that applications also provide an icon for iOS to display in Spotlight search results (and, if necessary, in Settings). In addition, some applications need custom icons to represent custom document types or application-specific functions and modes in navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars.  
Unlike other custom artwork in your app, these icons and images must meet specific criteria so that iOS can display them properly. In addition, icon and image files have naming requirements. Table 8-1 contains information about these icons and images and provides links to specific guidelines for creating them. To learn what to name these files and how to specify them in your code,see "Application Icons" in *iOS Application Programming Guide* and "Application Launch Images" in *iOS Application Programming Guide*.

For guidelines on how to make the most of your high-resolution artwork, see "Tips for [Creating](#page-152-0) Great Artwork for the Retina Display" (page 153).

**Note:** For all images and icons, the PNG format is recommended.  
The standard bit depth for icons and images is 24 bits (8 bits each for red, green, and blue), plus an 8-bit alpha channel.  
You do not need to constrain your palette to web-safe colors. Although you can use alpha transparency in the icons you create for navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars, do not use it in application icons.
