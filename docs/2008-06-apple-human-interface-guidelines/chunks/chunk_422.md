A **scrolling list** is a list that uses scroll bars to reveal its contents. Users can scroll through the list without selecting anything, click an item to select it, use Shift-click to select more than one contiguous item, or use Command-click for a discontinuous selection. Users can press the arrow keys to navigate through the list and can quickly select an item by typing the first few characters. You can see this behavior in a Finder window, when the Finder is in column-view mode. Each Finder-window column behaves as a scrolling list, as shown in [Figure](#page-325-0) 15-81 (page 326).
