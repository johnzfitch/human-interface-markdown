# Error-trapping

In most situations, user inputs must be checked for validity. Account numbers, employee numbers, and dates are just a few examples of items that should be checked to see if the data requested is on file or plausible. Numeric inputs should be screened for values too small or too large, if extreme values are invalid or potentially damaging to the program.

Many types of errors can be circumvented through software design: If, in testing, you find users repeatedly making the same kind of errors, change the software.

Be careful of the details, both during design and boundary-testing: for example, make your program insensitive to upper/lower case when no distinction is necessary, and test your program to make sure it is making no such distinction anywhere. This is a good example of design
