Modifier keys alter the way other keystrokes or mouse clicks are interpreted. You should use these keys—Shift, Caps Lock, Option, Command, and Control—consistently as described here.  
#### <span id="page-98-8"></span>**Shift**  
When pressed at the same time as a character key, the Shift key produces the uppercase alphabetic letter or the upper symbol on the key.  
The Shift key is also used with the mouse for extending a selection or for constraining movementsin graphics applications. For example, in some applications pressing Shift while using a rectangle tool draws squares.  
#### <span id="page-98-2"></span>**Caps Lock**  
When activated, the Caps Lock key hasthe same effect on alphabetic keys asthe Shift key, but it has no effect on nonalphabetic keys. When the Caps Lock key is down, the user must press Shift to type the upper character on a nonalphabetic key.  
#### <span id="page-98-7"></span>**Option**  
When used with other keys, the Option key produces special symbols. The Keyboard Viewer, which users can add to the Input menu in the International pane of System Preferences, shows which keys generate each symbol.  
The Option key can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. For example, in some applications pressing Option while dragging an object makes a copy of the object.  
#### <span id="page-98-3"></span>**Command**  
On most keyboards, the Command key is labeled with a cloverleaf symbol ( ) and an Apple logo ( ). Pressing the Command key at the same time as a character key tells the application to interpret the key as a command rather than a character. It can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. Key combinations that use the Command key are described in "Keyboard [Shortcuts"](#page-102-0) (page 103)  
#### <span id="page-98-6"></span><span id="page-98-4"></span>**Control**  
The Control key is used to modify the functions of other keys. Combined with a mouse click, it displays contextual menus (see ["Contextual](#page-183-0) Menus" (page 184)).  
Control-F7 temporarily overrides a user's preference for default navigation or full keyboard navigation in windows and dialogs. For more information, see "Keyboard Focus and [Navigation"](#page-106-0) (page 107)  
<span id="page-98-5"></span>**Cocoa:** In Cocoa applications, the Control key has additional defined behaviors, as described in "Text System Defaults and Key Bindings" in *Cocoa Event-Handling Guide* in Cocoa Events & Other Input Documentation.
