Using Open from an application, the user can open only a document that can be processed by that application. To open a document that can be processed only by some other application, the user must ordinarily leave the application and return to the Finder. Using Open from the Finder, the user can open any document—the appropriate application is automatically opened as well.  
When an application starts up by putting an empty untitled document on the screen, the Open option can remain enabled (not dimmed) even if the application allows only one open document at a time. In this case, choosing Open from the File menu simultaneously closes the empty document (why save an empty document?) and opens another.
