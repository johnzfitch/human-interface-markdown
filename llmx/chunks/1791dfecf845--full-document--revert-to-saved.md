#### Revert to Saved

Discards all changes made to the active document since the last time it was saved or opened. The document on disk is reopened. Before all this happens, a dialog box lets the user confirm that this is what he or she really wants. (This follows the principles that users should be allowed to make informed decisions and to change their minds.) Figure 3-33 shows a Revert to Saved dialog box.
