## Toggled menu items

Another way to show the presence or absence of an attribute is by a toggled operation. A toggled attribute has two states, and a single menu item allows the user to "toggle" between the states. You can show the user that an operation is toggled either with check marks or by changing the wording.

The Finder's View menu (Figure 26a) is an example of check marks that indicate the state of a toggled attribute. When View by Icon has been chosen, there is a check mark to the left of "by Icon" and none of the other views in the menu is checked.

Here's an example of changing the wording in a toggled menu item. When rulers are showing in a program that uses rulers, one item in the Format menu is Hide Rulers. If the user chooses this item, the rulers are hidden, and the name changes to Show Rulers. See Figure 27 26a. Use this technique only when the wording of the items makes it obvious that they're opposite sides of the same thing. Undo and Redo is another good example.
