<!-- Chunk 145 | Source: 1986-12 Human Interface Guidelines (Final Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 406 -->

This information will be in the final versions of Inside Macintosh, vol. V and Human Interface Guidelines: the Apple Desktop Interface (to be published by Addison Wesley)  
Scrolling menus were introduced with the Macintosh Plus and Macintosh 512K Enhanced, but this feature was invisible. When there were more than eighteen items in a menu (which can happen with fonts on a hard disk), the menu scrolled to show more items as the user moved the pointer past the last item, but users didn't know whether there were any more items in a menu unless they happened to drag past the bottom of it. The scrolling menu feature is now made visible by an indicator (similar to the hierarchical menu indicator), which appears at the bottom of the menu when there are more items (see Figure 1).

The indicator itself doesn't highlight, but the menu scrolls as the user drags over it. When the last item is shown, the indicator disappears.  
As soon as the menu starts scrolling, another indicator appears at the top of the menu to show that some items are now hidden in that direction (see Figure 2).

If the user drags back up to the top, the menu scrolls back down in the same manner. If the user lets go of the mouse button or selects another menu, and then selects the menu again, it appears in its original position, with the hidden items and the indicator at the bottom.
