Use your app definition statement throughout the development processto determine the suitability of features, controls, and terminology. For example:  
**As you consider adding a new feature**, ask yourself whether it's essential to the main purpose of your app and to your target audience. If it isn't, set it aside; it might form the basis of a different app. For example, you've decided that your users are interested in adventurous cooking, so emphasizing boxed cake mixes and ready-made meals would probably not be appreciated.  
**As you consider the look and behavior of the UI**, ask yourself whether your users appreciate a simple, streamlined style or a more overtly thematic style. Be guided by what people might expect to accomplish with your app, such as the ability to accomplish a serious task, to get a quick answer, to delve into comprehensive content, or to be entertained. For example, although your grocery list app needs to be easy to understand and quick to use, your audience would probably appreciate a themed UI that displays plenty of beautiful pictures of ingredients and meals.  
**As you consider the terminology to use**, strive to match your audience's expertise with the subject. For example, even though your audience might not be made up of expert chefs, you're fairly confident that they want to see the proper terms for ingredients and techniques.
