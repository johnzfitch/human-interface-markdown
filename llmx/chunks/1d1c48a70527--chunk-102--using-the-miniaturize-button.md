#### **Using the Miniaturize Button**  
A panel can have a miniaturize button, but it's rare that one would be needed. Like menus, panels can be closed and returned to the screen through a menu command. A miniaturize button is redundant unless a mini win dow would, for some reason, be more convenient for the user than the command, or unless the panel persists on-screen when the application isn't active (see "Persisting Panels," later in this chapter).
