At a minimum, a menu displays a list of menu items. Most menus also include a title that indicates the types of items that are in the list. In addition, menus can include some optional components, such as keyboard shortcut symbols, hierarchical menus (also known as submenus), toggled menu items, separators, icons, and symbols (such as the checkmark). For example, the TextEdit Edit menu includes a list of commands, a title ("Edit"), keyboard shortcuts, hierarchical menus, and separators that indicate different groups of items.

A menu bar menu might include examples of all of these components, but not all of them are suitable for every type of menu. For example, a contextual menu does not need a title because it is automatically related to the user's current selection. For guidelines on providing a contextual menu in your app, see ["Designing](#page-161-1) [Contextual](#page-161-1) Menus" (page 162).  
Menus are an example of the see-and-point paradigm: People identify what needs to be acted on and then specify the action by choosing a menu item.  
To choose an item in a menu, the user reveals the menu and moves the pointer to the desired item. Each active menu item highlights as the pointer passes over it and opens its submenu (if it has one). No action happens until the user chooses an item. This behavior allows people to open and scan menus to find out what features are available without having to actually perform an action. When the user chooses a menu item, it blinks briefly to confirm the user's choice and then performs the action.  
After the user opens a menu, it remains open until another action forces it to close. Such actions include:  
- Choosing an item in the menu
- Moving the pointer to another menu title in the menu bar
- Clicking outside of the menu
- A system-initiated alert
- <span id="page-133-0"></span>● A system-initiated app switch or quit
