Many of these suggestions also apply to graphics you develop for your application, for example, to augment a label or list item.  
- Use universal imagery that people will easily recognize. Avoid focusing on a secondary aspect of an element. For example, for a mail icon, a rural mailbox would be less recognizable than a stamped postcard.
- Avoid using anatomy in your icons. Such images are hard to do well and usually detract from the intended meaning. If you do use anatomy, make sure the style fits with the rest of your icons.
- Strive for simplicity. Try to use a single object that captures the icon's action or represents the control.
- Use color judiciously to help the icon tell its story; don't add color just to make the icon more colorful. Smooth gradients typically work better than sharp delineations of color.
- Avoid using replicas of Apple hardware products in your icons. Hardware designs change frequently; your icon could be obsolete or meaningless.
- Design toolbar icons at their actual size (32 by 32). For other icons, concentrate on perfecting your icon's look at 16 x 16. It's much easier to add flourishes to larger versions than it is to scale down an icon designed for a larger size. Most of the time, users will see your icon at the smaller sizes.
- Use the same perspective for your suite of icons. Toolbar icons should look as if they're sitting on a table and you're facing them squarely from the front. Other icons should look as if you're looking down at them sitting on a table in front of you.
- <span id="page-161-1"></span>■ Use a single light source with the light coming from above the icon.  
<span id="page-162-0"></span>The technique of dragging an item and dropping it on a suitable destination is called **drag and drop.**  
In this chapter, an **item** is anything that the user can select, such as text, graphics, and icons. For convenience, this chapter assumes that the user is dragging with the mouse, but these guidelines also apply to other input devices such as pens and trackballs.  
In Aqua, the Finder provides a new focus to indicate the target for a drop.
