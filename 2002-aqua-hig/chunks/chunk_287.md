The Mac OS X speech-synthesis engine converts any text into highly intelligible, natural-sounding speech. The engine speaks any text sent to it. Developers can send their own text to it using one line of code. In addition, some speech synthesis is automatically integrated into the interface via Talking Alerts, spoken Dock notification, saying the name of certain controls when the mouse points to them, and speaking selected text. Developers should not rely on those features alone, however, because users may not have turned them on in Speech preferences.  
Whenever your application uses a system alert sound or other aural cue to deliver specific feedback to users, consider providing the option of using speech synthesis instead. For many users, a spoken phrase is a much more natural and accessible means of communication; it's a cognitive burden to remember that a particular sound means a particular action has occurred. You can augment the user experience by providing speech feedback in addition to other forms of feedback. In order to accommodate people with special needs, any feedback to the user should be provided in audio as well as visual formats.
