Location Services allows applicationsto determine people's approximate location geographically, the direction they're pointing their device, and the direction in which they're moving. People appreciate being able to automatically tag content with their physical location or find friends that are currently nearby, but they also appreciate being able to disable such features when they don't want to share their location with others. (To learn more about how to make your app location-aware, see *Location Awareness Programming Guide*.)  
When users turn off Location Services and later use an application feature that requires their location, they see an alert that tells them they must change their preference before they can use the feature. The alert does not allow users to make this change within the app; instead, they must go to Settings and change their preference. This ensures that users are fully aware that they are granting systemwide permission to use their location information.

Follow these guidelines to ensure the best user experience for the location-aware features in your app:  
**Make sure users understand why they're being asked to turn Location Services on**. It's natural for people to be suspicious of a request for their personal information if they don't see an obvious need for it. To avoid making users uncomfortable, make sure the alert appears only when they attempt to use a feature that clearly needs to know their location. For example, people can use Maps when Location Services is off, but they see the alert when they access the feature that finds and tracks their current location.  
**Check the user's Location Services preference to avoid triggering the alert unnecessarily**. You can use Core Location programming interfacesto get thissetting (to learn how to do this,see *Core Location Framework Reference*). With this knowledge, you can trigger the alert as closely as possible to the feature that requires location information, or perhaps avoid an alert altogether.  
**Display the alert when your app starts only if your app cannot perform its primary function without knowing the user's location**. People will not be bothered by this because they understand that the main function of your app depends on knowing their location.  
**Avoid making any programmatic calls that trigger the alert before the user actually selects the feature that needs the information**. This way, you avoid causing people to wonder why your app wantstheir location information when they're doing something that doesn't appear to need it. (Note that getting the user's preference does not trigger the alert.)
