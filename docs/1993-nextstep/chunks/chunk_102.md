If resizing the panel might be useful, then it should have a resize bar. Like a standard window, a panel should constrain its shape if necessary to prevent the panel from becoming a size that's too large or too small.  
#### **Using the Miniaturize Button**  
A panel can have a miniaturize button, but it's rare that one would be needed. Like menus, panels can be closed and returned to the screen through a menu command. A miniaturize button is redundant unless a mini win dow would, for some reason, be more convenient for the user than the command, or unless the panel persists on-screen when the application isn't active (see "Persisting Panels," later in this chapter).  
#### **Using the Close Button**  
Every ordinary panel should have a close button so the user can dismiss the panel when it's not needed. The close button is never broken, since panels don't contain the main work of the application.
