When users Control-click a running app's Dock icon, a customizable Dock menu appears. By default, this menu displays the same items as the minimal Dock menu that is displayed when users press and hold the Dock icon (for more information about different styles of Dock menus, see "The [Dock"](#page-65-0) (page 66)). In addition, this menu can contain app-specific items,such asthe playback-focused commandsin the customized iTunes Dock menu.

The custom itemsthat you add appear in the Dock menu only when your app is open and the user Control-clicks the Dock icon. You might consider adding items such as:  
- Common commands to initiate actions in your app when it is not frontmost
- Commands that are applicable when there is no open document window
- Status and informational text  
For example, Mail provides commands to initiate a new message or to check for new messages. To learn how to customize the Dock menu for your app, see *Dock Tile Programming Guide* .  
**Be sure that all Dock menu commands are also available in your app's menus.** Users might not know about the Dock menu, so it should not be the only way to do something.
