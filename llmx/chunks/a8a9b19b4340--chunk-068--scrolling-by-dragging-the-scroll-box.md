#### Scrolling by Dragging the Scroll Box  
If the user starts dragging the scroll box, and then moves the pointer a certain distance outside the scroll bar, the scroll box stops following the pointer and snaps back to its original position. If the user then releases the mouse button, no scrolling occurs. But if the user, still holding down the mouse button, moves the pointer back *into* the scroll bar, the scroll box again begins to move up and down with the pointer.  
If a document has a fixed size, and the user scrolls to the right or bottom edge of the document, the application displays a light gray background between the edge of the document and the window frame.  
Some applications put the page number inside the scroll box so that the user can see the page number change as the document scrolls.
