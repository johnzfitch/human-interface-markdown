<span id="page-229-2"></span>A **dialog** is a window designed to elicit a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog, for example—permit the user to provide many responses at one time.  
An **alert** is a dialog that appears when the system or an application needs to communicate information to the user. Alerts provide messages about error conditions or warn users about potentially hazardoussituations or actions.
