A **bottom bar** is a window-frame area that is below the window body. Bottom bars are rarely used in modern Mac apps. If an earlier version of your app includes a bottom bar, consider redesigning the UI so that the controls are offered elsewhere, such as in the toolbar. If you're creating a new app, it's best to avoid using a bottom bar.  
In general, controls in a bottom bar are frequently used, but are somewhat less important than controls in a toolbar. For example, the bottom-bar controlsin iChat allow usersto add buddiesto the list and to text message, call, or video chat with a selected buddy, whereas the controls in the toolbar are focused on the user of the app.

Because a bottom bar is considered a window-frame area, it has the same gray gradient surface that is visible in the toolbar–title bar area.  
Bottom bars can contain either regular or small window-frame controls; bottom bars should not contain icon buttons, custom controls, or any Aqua controls that are designed for use in the window body. See ["Window-Frame](#page-240-0) Controls" (page 241) for more information about controls that are suitable for use in a bottom bar.  
**Avoid using a bottom bar to provide frequently used commands.** Users don't typically look at the bottom area of a window more often than they look at the top area, so placing the most important controls at the bottom makes them harder to find.  
**As much as possible, use the system-provided icons within bottom-bar controls.** Users are already familiar with the meaning of the system-provided images (for more information about them, see ["System-Provided](#page-319-0) [Icons"](#page-319-0) (page 320)). Note that you can also use text inside a bottom-bar control,such as"Edit." If you must design an icon for a bottom-bar control, try to imitate the clean lines of the system-provided images (for more information on designing icons for use in bottom-bar controls, see ["Designing](#page-121-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 122)).  
**Important:** If you choose to use system-provided images in your bottom-bar controls, be sure to avoid redefining their meanings. For example, use the Quick Look symbol to mean "preview with Quick Look" only; don't use it to mean "magnify."  
**Make sure that every bottom-bar item is also available as a menu command.** Also, bottom bars should not contain contextual menus. If you need to offer a collection of commands that users can perform on a selected item in the window body, provide an Action menu control that displays the system-provided Action image (for more information on this control, see ["Action](#page-262-0) Menu" (page 263)).  
<span id="page-193-0"></span>**Use Interface Builder to create a bottom bar of the appropriate size.** If you decide to include a bottom bar in your app, select the window object on the Interface Builder canvas and open the size inspector. Choose large or small bottom border in the Content Border pop-up menu. Use regular controls in the large bottom bar; use small controls in the small bottom bar.
