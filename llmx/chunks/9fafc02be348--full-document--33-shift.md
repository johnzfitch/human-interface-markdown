## 33. SHIFT

On keys with two legends on top, SHIFT designates the upper legend instead of the usual lower legend.

On alphabetic keys, SHIFT designates upper case instead of the usual lower case.

On the numeric keypad, SHIFT has no effect.

SHIFT also modifies the meaning of BACKSPACE and the mouse button, as explained elsewhere in this document.
