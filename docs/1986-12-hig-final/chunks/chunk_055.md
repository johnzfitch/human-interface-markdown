The menu bar extends across the top of the screen and displays the title of each available menu. (See Figure 25.)

Figure 25 Menu bar  
If the user moves the pointer to the Edit portion of the menu bar and presses the mouse button, the Edit menu appears, as shown in Figure 26. A menu becomes visible when the user selects it by pressing its title.  
Nothing but menu titles can appear in the menu bar. These should remain constant within a given application. If *all* the operations in a given menu are currently disabled (that is, the user can't choose them), the menu title should be dimmed (drawn in gray) but should remain visible in the menu bar. The user must always be able to pull down the menu and *see* the names of the operations even when none of them can, at the moment, be chosen.
