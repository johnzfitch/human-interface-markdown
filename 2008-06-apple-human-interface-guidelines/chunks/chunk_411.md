**Control sizes**: Text input fields are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. The height is fixed for each size, but you decide how long to make the control. In general, try to ensure that the length of the text input field comfortably accommodates the average length of the expected input. In addition, if you display multiple text input fields in a window, be sure they all have the same length. The height of each size of text input field is listed below (Figure 15-71 shows a regular-size text input field in different states):  
■ Regular size: 22 pixels high.  
■ Small: 19 pixels high.  
<span id="page-314-0"></span>■ Mini: 15 pixels high.

**Label spacing and fonts**: The introductory label for a text input field should be in a font that is proportional to the size of the control. In addition, the space between the introductory label and the input field should be consistent. Use the following metrics when you use a text input field in your window layout:  
- Regularsize: Use system font for the introductory label. Leave 8 pixels between the end of the introductory label (the colon) and the left edge of the text input field.
- Small: Use smallsystem font for the introductory label. Leave 6 pixels between the end of the introductory label (the colon) and the left edge of the text input field.
- Mini: Use mini system font for the introductory label. Leave 5 pixels between the end of the introductory label (the colon) and the left edge of the text input field.  
For more information about highlighting selectionsin text fields,see "Keyboard Focus and [Navigation"](#page-106-0) (page 107) and ["Selections](#page-110-0) in Text" (page 111).  
**Control spacing**: If you want to use more than one text input field in a window, you need to leave enough space between them so users can easily see which input field belongs with each introductory label. If you need to position more than one text input field at the same height (that is, in a horizontal line), be sure to leave plenty of space between the end of one text field and the introductory label of the next. Typically, however, multiple text input fields are stacked vertically, as in a form users fill out. When you position text input fields in a vertical stack, be sure to leave the following amounts of space between them:  
■ Regular size: At least 10 pixels.  
■ Small: At least 8 pixels.  
■ Mini: At least 8 pixels.
