If your iOS application creates documents of a custom type, you might want to create a custom icon that identifies this type to users. If you don't provide a custom document icon, iOS creates one for you by default, using your application icon (including the added visual effects).  
For example, a default document icon that uses the 57 x 57 pixel white star iPhone app icon would look like this:

A high-resolution default document icon that uses the 114 x 114 pixel white star iPhone app icon would look like this:

On the larger iPad, a default document icon that uses the 72 x 72 pixel white star app icon would look like this:

Optionally, you can provide custom artwork for iOS to use instead of your application icon. Because people will see your document icon in different places, it's best to design an image that's memorable and clearly associated with your application. Your custom artwork should be attractive, expressive, and detailed.
