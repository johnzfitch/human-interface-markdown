OS X provides standard panels for picking colors and fonts. Users are accustomed to the appearance, behavior, and availability of these panels throughout the system.  
The system-provided Colors window (shown below) lets users enter color data using any of five different color models.

If your app deals with color, you may need a way for the user to enter color information. Be sure to use the Colors window rather than create a custom interface for color selection. For information on how to use this window in your app, see *Color Programming Topics*.  
The standard version of the system-provided Fonts window (shown below) includesseveral controlsfor adjusting a font's characteristics. The minimal version of the Fonts window allows users to choose a font, typeface, and size.

If your app supports typography and text layout using user-selectable fonts, you should use the Fonts window to obtain the user's font selection rather than create a custom font-picker window.  
The standard Fonts window also provides advanced typography controls for fonts that support those options. The user can open a Typography inspector by choosing Typography from the action menu (shown above).
