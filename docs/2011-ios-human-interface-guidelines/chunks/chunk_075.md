Never quit an iOS application programmatically because people tend to interpret this as a crash. However, if external circumstances prevent your application from functioning as intended, you need to tell your users about the situation and explain what they can do about it. Depending on how severe the application malfunction is, you have two choices.  
**Display an attractive screen that describes the problem and suggests a correction**. A screen provides feedback that reassures usersthat there's nothing wrong with your application. It puts usersin control, letting them decide whether they want to take corrective action and continue using your application or press the Home button and open a different application
