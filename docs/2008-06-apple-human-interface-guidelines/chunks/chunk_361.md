#### A pop-up menu:  
- Usually has a label to the left (in left-to-right scripts). The label should have sentence-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-130-1) of Interface Element Labels and Text" (page 131) for more information on this capitalization style). The only exception is if the control is used as the title for a group box, which is not a common usage.
- Has a double-arrow indicator.
- Contains nouns (things) or adjectives (states or attributes), but not verbs (commands). If you need to display commands, use a pull-down menu instead. Use title-style capitalization for the item labels.
- <span id="page-281-0"></span>■ Displays a checkmark to the left of the currently selected value when open.

In special cases, you may want to include a command that affects the contents of the pop-up menu itself. For example, in the Print dialog, the Printer pop-up menu contains the Add Printer item, so users can add a printer to the menu; the new printer becomes the menu's default selection. Put such commands at the bottom of a pop-up menu, below a separator.
