#### **Text**  
For legibility, some non-Roman characters need higher resolution than Roman characters. On the Japanese Macintosh Plus, for example, this requires the system font to be larger than normal: it must allow for 16-by-16 pixel characters. The Macintosh Plus' ROM sets the system font size and family according to new low-memory globals. For example, it is possible to specify text in dialogs and menu bars to be 14-point New York. Applications should not change the system font or font size: this should be left to the user or the system. Applications can use SysFontSize to get the default font size to use for their text.
