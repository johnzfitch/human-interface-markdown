A **tab view** presents information in a multipane format.

**API Note:** To define a tab view in your code, use the NSTabView class.  
A tab view consists of a tab view control (which looks similar to a segmented control) combined with a set of views. Each segment in the tab view control is called a **tab**. The content area below a tab is called a **pane**, and each tab is attached to a specific pane. The tab view control is horizontally centered at the top edge of the view.  
Users click a tab to view the pane associated with that tab. Although different panes can contains different amounts of content, switching tabs does not change the overall size of the tab view or the window.  
Use a tab view to present a small number of different content views in one place within a window. Depending on the size of the window, you can create a tab view that contains between two and about six tabs.  
**Use a tab view to present a few peer areas of content that are closely related.** The outline of a tab view provides a strong visual indication of enclosure. Users expect each tab to display content that is in some way similar or related to the content in the other tabs.  
**Ensure that each pane contains controls that affect only the contents ofthat pane.** Controls and information in one pane should not affect objects in the rest of the window or in other panes.  
**In general, inset the tab view so that a margin of window-body area is visible on all sides of the tab view.** The inset layout looks good and it allows you to provide additional controls that can affect the window itself (or other tabs). For example, the "Enable access for assistive devices" and "Show Universal Access status in the menu bar" checkboxesin Universal Access preferences are outside of the inset tab view, because they represent settings that affect accessibility generally.  
It's also possible to extend the side and bottom edges of a tab view so that they meet the window edges, although this is unusual.  
**Provide a label for each tab that describes the contents of the pane.** It's best when users can accurately predict the contents of a pane before they click the tab. Nouns or very short noun phrases work well for tab labels, although a verb (or short verb phrase) might make sense in some contexts. Tab labels should have title-style capitalization (described in [Capitalizing](#page-46-0) Labels and Text (page 47)).  
**Avoid using a pop-up menu as a tab-switcher.** This arrangement is not encouraged in modern Mac apps. If you have too many tabsto fit into a single tab view, you should investigate other waysto factor your information hierarchy.
