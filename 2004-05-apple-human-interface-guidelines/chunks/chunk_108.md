A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (show or hide) while the parent window is open. A drawer should contain frequently accessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. A drawer's contents should be closely related to the contents of its parent window. A drawer automatically inherits the brushed metal appearance if its parent window is brushed metal (see ["Brushed Metal Windows"](#page-110-0) (page 111).

**Cocoa:** Drawers support is available via the NSDrawer class.  
#### When to Use Drawers  
Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time. (Contrast this criterion with a utility window, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer.) Some examples of uses of drawers include access to favorites lists, the Mailbox drawer (in the Mail application), or browser bookmarks.  
Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides out, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are primarily intended to replace modal dialogs, as described in ["When to Use Sheets"](#page-134-0) (page 135), whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.  
Some uses of a drawer are similar to uses of a source list. See ["Source Lists"](#page-109-0) (page 110) for information on when to use a source list.  
#### Drawer Behavior  
The user shows or hides a drawer, typically by clicking a button or choosing a command. If a drawer contains a valid drop target, you may also want to open the drawer when the user drags an appropriate object to where the drawer appears.  
When a drawer opens or closes, it appears to be sliding from behind its parent window, to the left, right, or down. You should ensure that a parent window's default position allows its drawer to open fully without disappearing offscreen. If a user moves a parent window to the edge of  
the screen and then opens a drawer, it should open on the side of the window that has room. If the user makes a window so big that there's no room on either side, the drawer opens off the screen.  
To support the illusion that a closed drawer is hidden behind its parent window, an open drawer should be smaller than its parent window. When the parent window is resized vertically, an open drawer resizes, if necessary, to ensure that it does not exceed the height of the parent window. (A drawer can be shorter than its parent window.) The illusion is further reinforced by the fact that the inner border of a drawer is hidden by the parent window and that the parent window's shadow is seen on the drawer when appropriate.  
The user can resize an open drawer by dragging its outside border. The degree to which a drawer can be resized is determined by the content of the drawer. If the user resizes a drawer significantly—to the point where content is mostly obscured—the drawer should simply close. For example, if a drawer contains a scrolling list, the user should be able to resize the drawer to cover up the edge of the list. But if the user makes the drawer so small that the items in the list are difficult to identify, the drawer should close. If the user sets a new size (if that is possible) for a drawer, the new size should be used the next time the drawer is opened.  
A drawer should maintain its state (open or closed) when its parent window becomes inactive or when the window is closed and then reopened. When a parent window with an open drawer is minimized, the drawer should close; the drawer should reopen when the window is made active again.  
A drawer can contain any control that is appropriate to its intended use. Follow normal layout guidelines, as stated in ["Positioning Full-Size Controls"](#page-202-1) (page 203).  
<span id="page-109-0"></span>Consider a drawer part of the parent window; don't dim a drawer's controls when the parent window has focus, and vice versa. When full keyboard access is on, a drawer's contents should be included in the window components that the user can select by pressing Tab.
