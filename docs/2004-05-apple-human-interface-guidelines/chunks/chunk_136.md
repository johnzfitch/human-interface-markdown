The buttons at the bottom right of a dialog all dismiss the dialog. A button that initiates an action is furthest to the right. This **action button** confirms the alert message text. The Cancel button sits to the left of this button.  
If there's a third button for dismissing the dialog, it should go to the left of the Cancel button. If the third button could result in data loss—Don't Save, for example—position it at least 24 pixels away from the "safe" buttons (Cancel and Save, for example).  
<span id="page-139-1"></span>A button that affects the contents of the dialog itself, such as Reset, should have its left edge aligned with the main dialog text or if there is a Help button, 12 pixels to the right of it.

Usually the rightmost button or the Cancel button is the **default button**. The default button should be the button that represents the action that the user is most likely to perform *if* that action isn't potentially dangerous. A default button has color and pulses to let the user know that it is the default. When the user presses the Enter key or the Return key, your application should respond as if the user clicked the default button.  
<span id="page-139-2"></span>Don't use a default button if the most likely action is dangerous—for example, if it causes a loss of user data. When there is no default button, pressing Return or Enter has no effect; the user must explicitly click a button. This guideline protects users from accidentally damaging their work by pressing Return or Enter. You can consider using a safe default button, such as Cancel.  
Don't use a default button if you use the Return key in text entry boxes. Having two behaviors for one key can confuse users and make the interface less predictable.  
In addition to the action button or buttons, it's a good idea to include a Cancel button. This button returns the computer to the state it was in before the dialog appeared. It means "forget I mentioned it." Always map the keyboard shortcut Command-period and the Esc (Escape) key to the Cancel button. These keyboard equivalents, along with Return and Enter, are accelerator keys and serve the purpose of letting the user respond quickly to a dialog or an alert. In general, it's not a good <span id="page-140-5"></span>idea to assign other keyboard shortcuts to buttons. If you find it useful to assign keyboard shortcuts to some buttons that are used very often in your application, be sure to follow the guidelines in ["Keyboard Shortcuts"](#page-27-0) (page 28).  
<span id="page-140-4"></span>In some circumstances, it's appropriate to implement an Apply button—for example, to permit a user to see the effect of multiple text attributes before committing to them. In cases like these, clicking Cancel should undo any of the applied changes. Be cautious about using an Apply button for operations that take a long time to implement or undo; it might not be obvious to users that they can interrupt or reverse the process.
