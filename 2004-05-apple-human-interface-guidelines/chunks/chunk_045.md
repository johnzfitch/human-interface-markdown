<span id="page-45-3"></span>If the user drags an item to a destination in your application, your application provides feedback that indicates whether it will accept that item. Destination feedback should not occur simply because your application is "drag-aware"; rather, it should depend on the destination's ability to accept the type of data contained in the dragged item. For example, a text entry field that accepts only text should not be highlighted when the dragged item is a graphic.  
<span id="page-45-5"></span>Use cursors to indicate what result letting go of the mouse will have. For example, if you are dragging an icon out of a toolbar, show the poof cursor when the user has the icon outside of the toolbar to indicate that if they let go of it there, the item will disappear. Other cursors that provide useful feedback during a drag operation include the alias, copy, and not allowed cursors. See ["Cursors"](#page-68-2) (page 69) for more information on the cursors available in Mac OS X.  
<span id="page-45-2"></span>**Carbon:** The actual appearance of destination feedback depends on the type of destination. The Drag Manager provides some utilities for simple highlighting; if your application needs more complex highlighting, you must provide your own highlighting utilities.
