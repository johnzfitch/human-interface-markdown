# **Types of Objects**

It's useful to distinguish among the three types of objects with which an application can deal: text, graphics, and lists (or arrays). Strictly speaking, *everything* on a Macintosh screen is displayed graphically, because the Macintosh has no text mode.

The rest to some fai nt meani ng make pretence But Shad\v'e11 neve r devi ates into se nse. Some beams of \v'it on other souls may fall, Stri ke through and make a 1ucid interval; But Shad\v'ell's genuine night admits no ray, His risi ng fogs prevail upon the day.

Graphics

**Figure** 7. Three Ways of Structuring Infonnation

**Text** can be arranged on the screen in a variety of ways. Some applications, such as word processors, might consist of nothing but text, whereas others, such as graphics-oriented applications, might use text almost incidentally. It's useful to consider all the text appearing together in a particular context as a block of text. The size of the block can range from a single field, as in a dialog box, to the whole document, as in a word processor.

Regardless of its size or arrangement, the application sees each block as a one-dimensional string of characters. Text is edited the same way regardless of where it appears.

Graphics are pictures, drawn either by the user or by the application. Graphics in a document tend to consist (but do not have to consist) of discrete objects, each of which can be selected individually.

Arrays are one- or two-dimensional arrangements of fields. One-dimensional arrays are called lists, two-dimensional arrays are called tables or forms. Each field, in turn, contains a collection of information, usually text, but possibly graphics. A table can be easily identified on the screen, because it consists of rows and columns of fields (sometimes called cells) separated by horizontal and vertical lines. A form is something the user fills out, like a tax form or credit-card application. The fields in a form can be arranged in any appropriate way; nevertheless, the application regards the fields as in a definite linear order.

Each of these three ways of presenting information retains its integrity, regardless of the context in which it appears. For example, a field in an array can contain text. When the user is manipulating the field as a whole, the field is treated as part of the array. When users want to change the contents of the field, they edit the field in the same way as they would any other text.

This section discusses first the general methods of selecting and then the specific methods that apply to text applications, graphics applications, and arrays. Figure 8 compares some of the general methods.
