Use an activity indicator in a toolbar or a main view to show that processing is occurring, without suggesting when it will finish.  
**Don't display a stationary activity indicator**, because users associate this with a stalled process.  
**Use an activity indicator when it's more important to reassure users that their task or process has not stalled** than it is to suggest when processing will finish.  
**If appropriate, customize the size and color of an activity indicator** to coordinate with the background of the view in which it appears.
