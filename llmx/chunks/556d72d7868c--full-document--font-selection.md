#### Font selection

The choice of script (or alphabet: Roman, Kanji, Arabic, and so on) depends on the fonts chosen by the user. If an application does not allow the user to change fonts, or allows the user only to select a global font for the whole document, then the user is restricted in the choice and mix of scripts.
