A **popover** is a transient view that can be revealed when people tap a control or tap in an onscreen area.

**API Note:** To learn more about defining a popover in your code, see *UIPopoverController Class Reference* and "Popovers".  
**Important:** Popovers are available in iPad apps only.  
#### A popover:  
- Is a self-contained view that hovers above the contents of a screen
- Always displays an arrow that indicates the point from which it emerged
- Has a translucent background that blurs content behind it
- Can contain a wide variety of objects and views, such as:
- Table, image, map, text, web, or custom views
- Navigation bars, toolbars, or tab bars
- Controls or objects that act upon objects in the current app view  
(By default, table views, navigation bars, and toolbars in a popover use a transparent background to let the popover's blurring show through.)  
In iPad apps, an action sheet always appears inside a popover.  
#### Use a popover to:  
- Display additional information or a list of items related to the focused or selected object.
- Display an action sheet containing a short list of options that are closely related to something on the screen.
- Display the contents of the left pane when a split-view–based app is in portrait. If you do this, you either provide an appropriately titled button that displaysthe popover—preferably in a navigation bar or toolbar at the top of the screen—or allow people to make the swipe gesture to hide and reveal it.  
**Avoid providing a "dismiss popover" button.** A popover should close automatically when its presence is no longer necessary. To determine when a popover's presence is no longer necessary, consider the following scenarios:

**In general, save users' work when they tap outside a popover's borders.** Not every popover requires an explicit dismissal, so people might dismiss them mistakenly. Discard the work people do in a popover only if they tap a Cancel button.  
**Make the popover arrow point as directly as possible to the element that revealed it.** Doing this helps people remember where the popover came from and what task or object it's associated with.  
**Make sure people can use a popover without seeing the app content behind it.** A popover obscures the content behind it, and people can't drag a popover to another location.  
**Ensure that only one popover is visible onscreen at a time.** You shouldn't display more than one popover (or custom view designed to look and behave like a popover) at the same time. In particular, you should avoid displaying a cascade or hierarchy of popovers simultaneously, in which one popover emerges from another.  
**Don't display a modal view on top of a popover.** Except for an alert, nothing should be displayed on top of a popover.  
**When possible, allow people to close one popover and open a new one with one tap.** This behavior is especially desirable when several different bar buttons each open a popover, because it prevents people from having to make extra taps.  
**Avoid making a popover too big.** A popovershouldn't appear to take over the entire screen. Instead, itshould be just big enough to display its contents and still point to the place it came from.  
Ideally, the width of a popover should be at least 320 points, but no greater than 600 points. The height of a popover is not constrained, so you can use it to display a long list of items. In general, though, you should try to avoid scrolling in a popover that enables a task or that presents an action sheet. Note that the system might adjust both the height and the width of a popover to ensure that it fits well on the screen.  
**Use standard UI controls and views within a popover.** In general, popovers look best, and are easier for users to understand, when they contain standard controls and views.  
**Make sure a custom popover still looks like a popover.** Although it's easy to customize many of the visual aspects of a popover by using the UIPopoverBackgroundView APIs, avoid creating a design that people might not recognize as a popover. If you change the appearance of a popover too much, users can't rely on their prior experience to help them understand how to use it in your app.  
**If appropriate, change a popover's size while it remains visible.** You might want to change a popover's size if you use it to display both a minimal and an expanded view of the same information. When you adjust the size of a visible popover, it's usually a good idea to animate the change because it avoids giving the impression that a new popover has replaced the old one.
