Figure 16-15 shows a well designed panel with mini controls. As you can see, this window observes the principles of center equalization, text and control alignment, and visual balance. In particular, notice that:  
- Stacked controls are left-aligned.
- Similar controls have the same width.
- The overall layout is center-equalized and visually balanced.

In addition, the panel uses white space in a consistent way. For example, in Figure 16-16, you can see:  
- Equal margins at the window sides and bottom edge (the window in Figure 16-16 uses 20-pixel margins in these areas).
- Equal spacing between groups of controls (the window in Figure 16-16 uses 12 pixels in these areas).
- Equal spacing between section labels and the first control in the section (the window in Figure 16-16 uses 8 pixels between the label of a control section, such as "Slideshow settings," and the first control in that section).  
In addition, the panel shown in Figure 16-16 uses a 10-pixel margin between the title bar and the top item in the window. To save space while creating distinct sections of controls, the example window uses bold font to label each section, instead of using horizontal separators or group boxes.
