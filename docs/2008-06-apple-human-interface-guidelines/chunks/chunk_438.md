<span id="page-323-2"></span>A **list view** displays ordered records in a table in which users can resize, rearrange, and sometimes add and subtract, columns representing attributes of the data. A list view displays the entire set of objects in the leftmost column, including objectsthat may be contained in other objectsif the data is hierarchically organized. When users reveal hidden objects in a hierarchy, the list lengthens. The other columns may shift to the right when these hidden objects are revealed, but they do not change their headings or order, because they still contain the same types of information regardless of the number of objects listed. Figure 15-79 shows an example of a list view that displays a flat list of objects (a hierarchical list of objects is shown in [Figure](#page-324-1) [15-80](#page-324-1) (page 325)).
