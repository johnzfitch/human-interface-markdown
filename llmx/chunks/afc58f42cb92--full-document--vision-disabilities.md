#### Vision Disabilities

People with vision problems have the most trouble with the output display. The Macintosh's ability vary the size of display text makes it easy to accommodate the needs of many people with vision problems. Software can be designed with a "zoom" feature that automatically increases the size of characters on the screen. Some systems even allow changing the size of the system font (but consider the effect this would have on the width of title bars and of the menu bar).

Color can present problems for many people. Don't let people's ability to use your software depend on their ability to distinguish one color from another. Be sure that all information contained in color—coded portions of the display is also presented in some other way (capitalization, position, highlighting).
