Help systems should present a sensible set of core actions to users without overloading them with too many complex features. Although you can use a few words of instruction to prompt users on how to use the help system (like "click here" or "select a topic"), don't turn the help system into a complicated application that requires lengthy instructions. In general, users don't really want to spend time using a help system. They just want to find the information they need and get back to their work.
