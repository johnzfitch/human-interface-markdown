The area to the right of a command can be used only to display a keyboard alternative or a submenu symbol. (Commands that control submenus can't have keyboard alternatives.) No other graphical devices are permitted in this area.  
In addition, menu commands should not use arbitrary graphical devices, such as check marks, to show state. There's almost always a more appropriate way to display current state in our interface-for example, by using buttons or check boxes in a panel or by designing objects that can be directly manipulated (such as those in the Edit application's ruler).  
#### **Programming Note:** Tools for **Creating Menus**  
Project Builder creates your application's main menu. You can add commands and menus using Interface Builder. Some standard commands provided by Interface Builder have actions or submenus already associated with them. For example, by dragging the Windows command from the Palettes window of Interface Builder into your application's main menu, you give your application the full functionality described in I'The Windows Menu," later in this chapter.
