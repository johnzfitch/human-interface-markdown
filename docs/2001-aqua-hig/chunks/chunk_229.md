The angles and shadows used for depicting various kinds of icons are intended to reflect how the objects would appear in reality. All Aqua interface elements have a common light source from directly above, not from the upper-left corner as in Mac OS 9 and earlier. The various perspectives are achieved by changing the position of the camera capturing the icon.

<span id="page-202-1"></span>Utility icons are depicted as if they are on a shelf in front of you. Flat objects appear as if there is a wall behind them with an appropriate shadow behind the object.

An actual three-dimensional object such as a rocket, however, would more realistically be viewed sitting on the ground; its icon shows the rocket sitting on a shelf, with its shadow below it.

<span id="page-203-3"></span><span id="page-203-2"></span>For toolbar icons, the perspective is also straight-on, as if the object is on a shelf in front of you.
