Each app and document window exists in its own layer on a desktop, so that windows and documents from different apps can be interleaved. Clicking a window to bring it to the front doesn't disturb the layering order of any other window on the desktop.  
A window's depth in the layers is determined by when the user last accessed it. When a user clicks an inactive document window or chooses it from the app's Window menu, only that document—and any open panel associated with it—is brought to the front.  
Users can bring all of an app's windows forward by clicking the app icon in the Dock or by choosing Bring All to Front in the app's Window menu. These actions bring forward all of the app's open windows, maintaining their onscreen location, size, and layering order within the app.  
Panels are always in the top layer. They are visible only when their app is active, and they float on top of any open document windows in the app.  
Users can view all of an app's open windows by activating App Exposé. In App Exposé view, users can choose one of the open windows on the current desktop or scroll to find an open window on a different desktop. Users can also cycle forward or backward through an app's open windows on the current desktop by using Command-Backquote (Command-`) and Command-Shift-Backquote (Command-Shift-`). If full keyboard access is on, they can cycle through all windows by using Control-F4 and Shift-Control-F4.
