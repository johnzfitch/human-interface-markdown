<span id="page-36-4"></span>To choose an item in a menu, the user positions the pointer on the menu title and drags to the desired item. Each item is highlighted as it is selected. No action actually happens until the user releases the mouse button. A menu item blinks briefly to indicate that it has been activated.  
By moving the pointer off a menu before completing a mouse click, people can open and scan menus to find out what features are available, without having to actually perform an action.  
<span id="page-36-3"></span>It may be appropriate in some cases to provide **dynamic menu items**—commands that change when the user presses a modifier key. For example, if the user opens the File menu in the Finder and then presses the Option key, the Close Window command changes to Close All. The Menu Manager appropriately sizes the menu to hold the widest item, including Option-enabled commands.
