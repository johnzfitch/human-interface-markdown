## Vision disabilities

People with vision problems have the most trouble with the output display. The Macintosh's ability to handle different sizes of text makes it easy to accommodate the needs of many people with vision problems. Software can be designed with a "zoom" feature that automatically increases the size of characters on the screen.

Color is a problem for many people. Don't let people's ability to use your software depend on their ability to distinguish one color from another. Be sure that all information conveyed by color coding is also presented in some other way (text, position, or highlighting).

Many people have difficulty using the instruction manuals that usually accompany software products, either because they have difficulty reading small print or because they physically can't handle books. These people appreciate having at least the most important part of the manual's text available in electronic form, so that they can display or print it in oversize characters, print it with a Braille printer, or have it read to them through a speech synthesizer. All users benefit from manuals in electronic form, which can quickly be searched for specific topics and keywords.
