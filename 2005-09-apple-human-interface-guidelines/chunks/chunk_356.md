As when using full-size controls, you should strive for the center-equalized approach to laying out controls. This visually balanced layout can be seen in Figure 15-13.

Aswith full-size controls, small (and mini) controls should be aligned verticallywhen stacked. Similar controls should have consistent widths and be aligned with each other. See Figure 15-14.

Control widths consistent  
As Figure 15-15 shows, small controls have spacing guidelines different from those for than standard controls:  
- Leave 8 to 10 pixels from the top of the content and the toolbar or title bar.
- The text box around any label should be at least 2 pixels below other controls.
- Side borders should be 10 pixels.
- Controls should be inset at least 10 pixels in group boxes.
- Leave a 12-pixel border on the bottom edge.
- Within any grouping, follow the spacing guidelines for the individual controls. See ["Controls"](#page-220-0) (page 221).  
If your window has a toolbar, like the utility window in Figure 15-15, the toolbar buttons should be big enough to accommodate 16 x 16 icons.
