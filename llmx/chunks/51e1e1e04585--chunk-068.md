Only those desk accessories installed in the current System file can appear in the Apple menu. There are some desk accessories that are linked to a particular application—for example, spelling checkers that appear in the Apple menu only when a word processing application is active. The list of desk accessories is expanded or reduced according to what's available. There can be more than one accessory on the desktop at one time, as shown in Figure 30.

The Apple menu also contains the About... menu item. Choosing this item brings up a dialog box with the name, version number, and copyright information for the current application, as well as any other information the application developer wants to display. The Help item is also commonly in the Apple menu. In some applications, the Help and About... functions are combined in one menu item.
