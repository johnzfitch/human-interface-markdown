In Mac OS X, users can interrupt a quit operation with documents still unsaved. For example, if a user chooses Quit and a save alert (a sheet) opens for a document, the user can work on other documents or switch to another application without addressing the save alert. To minimize the impact of such interruptions, all save alerts initiated by a Quit command should include a message that alerts users that they are in the midst of a quit operation. See Figure 6-9 (page 108) for an example.  
When a user quits an application in which all open documents have been saved, all documents close immediately and the application quits.
