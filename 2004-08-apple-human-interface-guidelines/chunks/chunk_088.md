Icons for utility applications—which are used less often and not simply for fun or creative activities convey a more serious tone than those for user applications. Color in these icons is desaturated, predominantly gray, and added only when necessary to clearly communicate what the applications do.

Because utility applications are normally focused on a narrow set of tasks, it's best to keep the number of elements in the icon to a minimum. The focus should be a single object that represents what the utility does. The perspective of utility icons is straight-on, as if they are on a shelf in front of you.
