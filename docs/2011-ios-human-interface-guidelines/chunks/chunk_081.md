If your iPhone application has a toolbar, consider moving it to the top of the screen instead of leaving it at the bottom. With the additional width of the iPad screen, you should be able to provide all of your toolbar functionality in a single toolbar at the top. This gives you more vertical space for your focused content.  
For example, Mail on iPhone uses a toolbar at the bottom to give people access to the refresh, organize, trash, reply, and compose actions while they view messages.

Mail on iPad migrates all but one of these actionsto a toolbar located above the message. The Refresh control is in the mailbox list, which is in a popover in portrait and in the left pane of the split view in landscape.
