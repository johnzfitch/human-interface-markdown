Add your own app-specific menus as appropriate. Place these menus between the View menu and the Window menu. For example, the Safari-specific History and Bookmarks menus appear between the View and Window menus.

**Make app commands available in menus.** The menu bar is the first place people tend to look for commands, especially when they're new to an app. It's a good idea to list all important commands in the appropriate app menus so that people can find them easily. It can be appropriate to omit infrequently used or power user commands from your app's menus (instead making them available in a contextual menu, for example), but be wary of doing this too often. Even experienced users can fail to find commands that are essentially hidden in this way.  
**As much as possible, arrange menus so that they reflect the hierarchy of objects in your app.** For example, if your app helps users create animated stories, the app-specific menus might be Scenes, Characters, Backgrounds, and Projects. Because a user probably seesthe project as a high-level entity that containsscenes, each of which contains backgrounds and characters, a natural ordering of these menus might be Projects, Scenes, Backgrounds, and Characters. In general, place the menusthat display commandsto handle high-level, more universal objectstoward one end of the menu bar and the menusthat focus on the more specific entities toward the opposite end. When your app is used in countriesthat use left-to-rightscripts, the high-level menus should appear on the left; in countries that use right-to-left scripts, the high-level menus should appear on the right.
