When people directly manipulate onscreen objects instead of using separate controls to manipulate them, they're more engaged with the task and they more readily understand the results of their actions. iOS users enjoy a heightened sense of direct manipulation because of the Multi-Touch interface. Using gestures gives people a greater affinity for, and sense of control over, the objects they see onscreen, because they're able to touch them without using an intermediary, such as a mouse.  
For example, instead of tapping zoom controls, people can use the pinch gestures to directly expand or contract an area of content. And in a game, players move and interact directly with onscreen objects. For example, a game might display a combination lock that users can spin to open.  
In an iOS application, people can experience direct manipulation when they:  
- Rotate or otherwise move the device to affect onscreen objects
- Use gestures to manipulate onscreen objects
- Can see that their actions have immediate, visible results
