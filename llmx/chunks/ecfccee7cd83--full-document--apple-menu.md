#### Apple menu

| Apple-?      | Help  |
|--------------|-------|
| menu<br>File |       |
| Apple-N      | New   |
| Apple-O      | Open  |
| Apple-S      | Save  |
| Apple-Q      | Quit  |
| menu<br>Edit |       |
| Apple-Z      | Undo  |
| Apple-X      | Cut   |
| Apple-C      | Copy  |
| Apple-V      | Paste |

Many desk accessories (which are accessible from all applications) use the Clipboard and must be able to depend on the keyboard equivalents for Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste.

The keyboard equivalent for Quit is important in case there's a mouse malfunction. The user can still leave the application in an orderly way (with <sup>a</sup> dialog box that accepts the Return key as a Yes response), saving any changes made to documents since the documents were last saved.

Note that the Edit menu's four reserved letter keys are in close proximity to each other and to the Apple key, allowing easy one-hand operation.

The keyboard equivalents in the Style menu are less strictly reserved. Applications that have <sup>a</sup> Style menu shouldn't use these keyboard equivalents for any other purpose, but applications that have no Style menu may use them for any purpose. Remember that you risk confusing users if a given key combination means different things in different applications.
