# USING GRAPHICS

The MouseGraphics toolkit gives full access to the Apple II high-resolution graphics screen. To use this screen to its best advantage, MouseGraphics applications use graphics copiously, even in places where other applications use text. As much as possible, all commands, features, and parameters of an application, and all the user's data, appear as graphic objects on the screen. Figure 2 shows some of the ways in which applications can use graphics to communicate with the user.
