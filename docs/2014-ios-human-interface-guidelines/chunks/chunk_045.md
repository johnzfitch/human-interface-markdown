Aesthetic integrity doesn't measure the beauty of an app's artwork or characterize its style; rather, it represents how well an app's appearance and behavior integrates with its function to send a coherent message.

People care about whether an app delivers the functionality it promises, but they're also affected by the app's appearance and behavior in strong—sometimes subliminal—ways. For example, an app that helps people perform a serious task can put the focus on the task by keeping decorative elements subtle and unobtrusive and by using standard controls and predictable behaviors. This app sends a clear, unified message about its purpose and its identity that helps people trust it. But if the app sends mixed signals by presenting the task in a UI that's intrusive, frivolous, or arbitrary, people might question the app's reliability or trustworthiness.  
On the other hand, in an app that encourages an immersive task—such as a game—users expect a captivating appearance that promises fun and excitement and encourages discovery. People don't expect to accomplish a serious or productive task in a game, but they expect the game's appearance and behavior to integrate with its purpose.
