Apps are classified by role—user app,software utility, and so on—and each role is associated with a recognizable icon style, or **icon genre**. An icon genre helps convey what users can do with an app before they open it. You can see a couple of different icon genres represented in the Dock.

Two icon genres that are easy to distinguish are user apps and utilities. In general, the icons for user apps are colorful and inviting, whereas the icons for utilities have a more serious appearance. For example, compare the bright colors used in the user app icons (shown in the top row of the figure below) to the grayer coloration of the utility icons (shown in the bottom row).

An **icon family** is a set of icons that reuse certain graphic elements. An app might create an icon family to help users identify files and other entities that are associated with the app. For example, iTunes reuses visual cues from its app icon in a plug-in icon:
