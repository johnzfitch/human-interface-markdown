#### **Resizing**

![](images/_page_68_Figure_3.jpeg)

If a window has a resize bar, the user can change the size of the window by dragging the resize bar. An outline of the window edge follows the cursor, as shown in the figure above. When the user releases the mouse button, the window resizes to the outline.
