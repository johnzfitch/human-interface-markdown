There are three kinds of keys on a Newton keyboard: character keys, modifier keys, and editing keys. A character key enters text. A modifier key redefines the most of the character keys. An editing key moves the text-insertion caret.  
#### Character Keys 6  
Most of the keys on a keyboard are character keys. There are character keys for letters, numbers, punctuation, and blank space. If the user taps one of these keys while entering text, the corresponding character is added to the text. The tab, return, and del keys also act as character keys. Although they don't add characters to the text, they do have a visible effect on the text, as described in the following paragraphs.  
#### <span id="page-202-0"></span>Return 6  
In a field that allows entering multiple lines of text, the return key inserts a carriage return at the text-insertion caret. It ends the current paragraph and moves the caret to the beginning of the next line. In a field that allows entering one line of text, the return key moves the caret to the next text-input field in the same container view. Tapping the return key is never a shortcut for tapping a button or other control. In particular, tapping the return key does not close the frontmost container view.  
#### Tab 6  
In a field that allows entering multiple lines of text, the tab key moves the text caret to the next tab stop. In a field that allows entering one line of text, the tab key moves the text caret to the next text-input field in the same container view.  
#### Del 6  
The del key deletes currently selected text. If no text is selected, tapping the del key removes the character preceding the text caret.  
#### Shift 6  
The shift key acts like its namesake on a typewriter. It changes the character produced by the next tap on a character key, making alphabetic keys produce capital letters, number keys produce punctuation or symbols, and so on. Unlike the shift key on typewriter or personal computer, the Newton shift key is not pressed concurrently with pressing a character key. The Newton shift key locks on when tapped and releases automatically when a character key is tapped.  
#### Caps 6  
The caps key makes the alphabetic keys produce capital letters but has no effect on any other keys. In other words, even when caps is on, a user must tap the shift key to produce punctuation and symbols with the number keys  
Typing **6-35**  
<span id="page-203-0"></span>and other nonalphabetic keys. The caps key locks on when tapped and stays on until tapped again; even closing a keyboard does not turn off the caps key.  
#### Option 6  
The option key changes the character produced by the next tap on a character key to produce a set of international characters and special symbols. For example, in many Newton fonts, option-4 produces the ¢ symbol, option-r produces ®, and option-g produces ©. Like the Newton shift key, the Newton option key is not pressed concurrently with pressing a character key. The Newton option key locks on when tapped and releases automatically when a character key is tapped. Option can be used together with shift, in combination with a character key, to produce still other symbols. For example, option-shift-? produces the Spanish ¿ character.  
#### Arrow Keys 6  
The left arrow and right arrow keys move the text caret left or right one character at a time. If a user selects some text and then taps an arrow key, the text is deselected and the caret appears at the right or left edge of the selection. This action doesn't move the selected text.  
If a user selects a shape and then taps an arrow key, nothing happens. The selected shape does not move, and the selection does not change.  
Arrow keys never duplicate the function of scroll arrows.  
The modifier keys—caps, shift, and option—have no effect on the arrow keys.
