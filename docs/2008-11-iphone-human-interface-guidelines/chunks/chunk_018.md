In addition to seeing the results of their actions, users need immediate feedback when they operate controls and status reports during lengthy operations. Your application should respond to every user action with some visible change. For example, make sure list items highlight briefly when users tap them. Audible feedback also helps, but it can't be the primary or sole feedback mechanism because people may use iPhone OS–based devices in places where they can't hear or where they must turn off the sound. In addition, you don't want to compete with the iPhone OS system sounds users already associate with system alerts.  
iPhone OS automatically provides feedback when it's temporarily busy by displaying the activity indicator. During operations that last more than a few seconds, your application should show elapsing progress and, if appropriate, display an explanatory message.  
<span id="page-31-2"></span>Animation is a great way to provide feedback to users, as long as it's both subtle and meaningful. Animation pervades iPhone OS, even in nonimmersive applications. As a means of providing feedback, however, it is used to enhance the user's experience, not as the focus of the user's experience.
