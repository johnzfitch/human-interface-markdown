<span id="page-209-4"></span>A Find window is a modeless dialog that opens in response to the Find command to provide an interface for specifying items to search for. Its appearance can vary depending on the needs of your application, but if your application handles text you might want to make your Find window similar to the one illustrated in Figure 13-35 to provide a consistent user experience.
