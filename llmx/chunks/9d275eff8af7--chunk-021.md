<!-- Chunk 21 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 175 -->
Often there is a trade-off between ease of learning and ease of use. Carefully balance your decisions: if the program is too difficult to learn, salespeople will not learn it and, thus, not sell it. If endless instructions and voluminous menus make it slow and cumbersome to use, people will get frustrated and tell their friends not to buy it.  
You will find a number of guidelines devoted to overcoming this problem. Both syntactic and content help should be available at the point at which it is needed; designers are successfully doing that without encumbering the experienced user. See: Help and Menu. Many designers have successfully created a multi-tiered interface. See: Novice/expert modes.
