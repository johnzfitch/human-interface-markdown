#### Colored text  
Reading and legibility studies in the print (paper) world show that colored text is harder to read than black text on a white background. This also appears to be true in the limited studies that have been done in the computer domain, although almost all these studies have looked at colors on <sup>a</sup> black background, rather than <sup>a</sup> white background. (Keep this in mind ifyou hear that "amber is the best color for text.")
