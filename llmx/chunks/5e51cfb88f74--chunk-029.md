Computers hold tremendous promise for people with many kinds of disabilities. Computers can magnify the productivity and mobility of disabled people even more than for other users. But too often, computers perversely become obstacles rather than enablers, because many disabilities make it hard to use standard computers and software. In most cases, thoughtful hardware design is the solution, but there are things that software designers can do, too.  
Many of the modifications that make programs easier for disabled people to use are simple and inexpensive to make, and they often have a welcome and unexpected side effect—the programs are easier for *everyone* to use. Although sidewalk curb cuts are designed to help people who rely on crutches and wheelchairs, they are used and appreciated at least as much by the more able—bodied population. Similarly, keyboard shortcuts for mouse activities are provided because using the mouse is difficult for people with motor problems—but other users take advantage of them as well.
