**Separators** are used to divide a window into distinct visual parts. Separators may be placed either vertically or horizontally. They should usually not span the entire width of a window but should align with the edges of the controls in the window.  
A label may accompany the separator. The separator line should be at the base of the text of the label.  
**Carbon:** Separators are available in Interface Builder. Create them programmatically with CreateVisualSeparatorControl.  
**Cocoa:** Separators are available in Interface Builder. To create one programmatically, use NSBox. See "Using a Box Control to Create a Separator" in *Boxes*in Cocoa User Experience Documentation.
