You can specify the text, the number of buttons, and the button contents in an alert. You can't customize the width or the background appearance of the alert view itself, or the alignment of the text (it's center-aligned).  
**Note:** As you read these guidelines, be aware of the following definitions:  
- **Title-style capitalization** meansthat every word is capitalized, except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four or fewer letters.
- **Sentence-style capitalization** means that the first word is capitalized, and the rest of the words are lowercase, unless they are proper nouns or proper adjectives.  
The alert title (and optional message) should succinctly describe the situation and explain what people can do about it. Ideally, the text you write gives people enough context to understand why the alert has appeared and to decide which button to tap.
