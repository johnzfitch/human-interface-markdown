Providing clarity is another way to ensure that content is paramount in your app. Here are some ways to make the most important content and functionality clear and easy to interact with.

**Use plenty of negative space.** Negative space makes important content and functionality more noticeable and easier to understand. Negative space can also impart a sense of calm and tranquility, and it can make an app look more focused and efficient.  
**Let color simplify the UI.** A key color—such as yellow in Notes—highlights important state and subtly indicates interactivity. It also gives an app a consistent visual theme. The built-in apps use a family of pure, clean system colorsthat look good at every tint and on both dark and light backgrounds.

**Ensure legibility by using the system fonts.** iOS 7 system fonts automatically adjust letter spacing and line height so that text is easy to read and looks great at every size. Whether you use system or custom fonts, be sure to adopt Dynamic Type so your app can respond when the user chooses a different text size.  
**Embrace borderless buttons.** In iOS 7, all bar buttons are borderless. In content areas, a borderless button uses context, color, and a call-to-action title to indicate interactivity. And when it makessense, a content-area button can display a thin border or tinted background that makes it distinctive.
