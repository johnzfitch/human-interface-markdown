As discussed in "Brushed Metal [Windows](#page-186-0) " (page 187), there are times when it is appropriate to use brushed metal windows for application windows. Brushed metal windows have slightly different spacing guidelines from those for standard Aqua windows as listed here and shown in Figure 15-11.  
- Leave 9 pixels from the bottom of the window controls at the top of the window and the top any controls.
- Leave 12 pixels of space between the bottom of any toolbar controls and other controls.
- The side borders should be 14 pixels wide.
- The bottom border should be 18 pixels deep.
- All splitter bars should be the same width (here, both are 9 pixels).  
In addition to these brushed metal–specific guidelines, there are two other things to note in Figure 15-11 that apply to both brushed metal windows and standard Aqua windows:  
- Leave at least 12 pixels between horizontally arranged buttons.
- When grouping horizontally arranged buttons, leave at least 24 pixels of space between groups (here the space is 28 pixels).
