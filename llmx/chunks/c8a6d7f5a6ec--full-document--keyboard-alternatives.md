#### **Keyboard Alternatives**

A graphical user interface is easy for most people to learn and remember. Objects have a familiar look on the screen and behave in a way that's reminiscent of the real-world objects they emulate. However, many users find it faster and easier to operate graphical objects using the keyboard rather than the mouse. For this reason, it's often appropriate to provide keyboard alternatives to the mouse, at least for common operations.
