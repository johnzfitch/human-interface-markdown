First impressions are lasting impressions,so design your installation process accordingly. If users have trouble getting your application up and running, they are going to make judgements about it even before they use it. Your software update mechanism also creates an impression. Users want to be able to get the newest version of your application easily and when it's convenient for them. If users have trouble getting and installing the latest software updates or patches you provide, you may find your technical support costs rising.  
This chapter discusses some things you can do to provide the best Macintosh experience before the user launches your application for the first time. It also describes how you can provide an unobtrusive and customizable software update experience to your users.
