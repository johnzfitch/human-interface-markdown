#### Shift

The Shift key, when used together with another character key, produces the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys, or the upper character on two-character keys. The Shift key is also used in conjunction with the mouse for extending a selection (see "Selecting" in this chapter) or for constraining movement in graphics applications—for example, in MacPaint, holding down the Shift key while using the rectangle tool limits the tool to drawing squares.
