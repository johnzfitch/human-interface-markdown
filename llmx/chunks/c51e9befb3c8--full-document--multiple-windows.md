# Multiple Windows

Some applications may be able to keep several windows on the desktop at the same time. Each window is in a different plane. Windows can be moved around on the desktop much like pieces of paper can be moved around on a real desktop. Each window can overlap those behind it, and can be overlapped by those in front of it. Even when windows don't overlap, they retain their front-to-back ordering.

Different windows can represent:

- different parts of the same document, such as the beginning and end of a long report
- different interpretations of the same document, such as the tabular and chart forms of a set of numerical data
- related parts of a logical whole, like the listing, execution, and debugging of a program
- separate documents being viewed or edited simultaneously

Each application may deal with the meaning and creation of multiple windows in its own way.

The advantage of multiple windows is that the user can isolate unrelated chunks of information from each other. The disadvantage is that the desktop can become cluttered, especially if some of the windows can't be moved. Figure 12 shows multiple windows.
