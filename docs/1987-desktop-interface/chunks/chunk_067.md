There are several menu items, particularly in the File and Edit menus, that commonly have keyboard equivalents. Keyboard equivalents are provided for people who prefer to keep their hands on the keyboard instead of using <sup>a</sup> pointing device to choose operations from menus.  
The letter used for <sup>a</sup> keyboard equivalent should be mnemonic—it should either be the first letter of the command (or of an important word in the command), or it should have some other relevance (X for Cut, for example) so that the user can remember it. Keyboard equivalents are case independent. In other words, both Apple-S and Apple<sup>s</sup> mean Save. The keyboard equivalents are shown in the menus as capital letters for consistency and aesthetics. The keyboard equivalent for Help in the Apple menu isshown as Apple-?, but itdoesn't actually require that the Shift key be pressed. Modifier-key combinations other than the ones listed here should also be case independent.  
For the sake of consistency, several of the available keyboard equivalents should be used only for the operations listed below and should never be used for any other purpose.  
#### Apple menu  
| Apple-?      | Help  |
|--------------|-------|
| menu<br>File |       |
| Apple-N      | New   |
| Apple-O      | Open  |
| Apple-S      | Save  |
| Apple-Q      | Quit  |
| menu<br>Edit |       |
| Apple-Z      | Undo  |
| Apple-X      | Cut   |
| Apple-C      | Copy  |
| Apple-V      | Paste |  
Many desk accessories (which are accessible from all applications) use the Clipboard and must be able to depend on the keyboard equivalents for Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste.  
The keyboard equivalent for Quit is important in case there's a mouse malfunction. The user can still leave the application in an orderly way (with <sup>a</sup> dialog box that accepts the Return key as a Yes response), saving any changes made to documents since the documents were last saved.  
Note that the Edit menu's four reserved letter keys are in close proximity to each other and to the Apple key, allowing easy one-hand operation.  
The keyboard equivalents in the Style menu are less strictly reserved. Applications that have <sup>a</sup> Style menu shouldn't use these keyboard equivalents for any other purpose, but applications that have no Style menu may use them for any purpose. Remember that you risk confusing users if a given key combination means different things in different applications.
