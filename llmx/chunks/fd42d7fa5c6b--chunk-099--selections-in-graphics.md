#### Selections in graphics  
In existing applications, there are several different ways to select graphic objects and to show selection feedback. This section shows how MacDraw and MacPaint do it, but other situations may require other solutions.  
A MacDraw document is <sup>a</sup> collection of individual graphic objects. To select one of these objects, the user clicks once on the object, which is then bracketed with "handles." (The handles are used to stretch or shrink the object.) Figures 3-59 and 3-60 show examples of selection in MacDraw and MacPaint.

Figure 3-59 Graphic selection In MacDraw  
In MacDraw, there are two ways to select more than one object. A range selection includes every object completely contained within the dotted rectangle that encloses the range as the user drags the mouse. A discontinuous selection includes only those objects explicitly selected.  
<sup>A</sup> MacPaint document, on the other hand, is <sup>a</sup> series of pixels—not discrete objects. Selections are shown surrounded by <sup>a</sup> moving dashed line (sometimes called a marquee or "marching ants").
