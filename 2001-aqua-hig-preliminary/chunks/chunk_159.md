<span id="page-174-1"></span>Use the Help Viewer to display onscreen documentation. The Help Viewer is a lightweight application that displays HTML, natively displays QuickTime media, provides full-text searching of help with relevancy-ranked results, and provides for task automation using AppleScript. Additionally, the Help Viewer allows you to integrate all, or a portion, of Internet-based help files, permitting you to update and improve your instructions as often as necessary.  
When you use the Help Viewer, your help book automatically becomes accessible via the Help Center, an Apple-provided location that allows users to easily browse and search all of the help available on their system.
