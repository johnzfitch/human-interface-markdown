<span id="page-92-2"></span>On most keyboards, the Command key is labeled with a cloverleaf symbol ( ) and an Apple logo ( ).

It can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. Key combinations that use the Command key are described in ["Keyboard](#page-97-0) [Shortcuts"](#page-97-0) (page 98).
