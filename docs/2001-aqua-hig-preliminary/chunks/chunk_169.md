- Are the Apple, application, File, Edit, and Window menus present, with at least the standard items?
- Does the application support Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste, and are these items in the Edit menu?
- Does your application menu contain About, Preferences, Hide, and Quit?
- Do the unique menus of the application have names that are appropriate? Are the names sufficiently different from the standard system menu names? Can the user understand and remember their meaning?
- Are frequently used menu items available at the top level rather than in a submenu or a dialog? If not, can the user change their location?
- Are unavailable items dimmed (rather than being omitted)? Are dimmed items unselectable? If all items in a menu are unavailable, is the menu title dimmed? Can the user still pull down the menu and see the dimmed names of the operations?
- Are toggled menu items either unambiguously a verb or unambiguously a state of being?
- Are menu titles and items in caps/lowercase unless there is a compelling reason to have a different style, such as an ALL CAPS item in a Style menu?
- Do menu items have an ellipsis character (…) if more information is required from the user before completing the command?
- Are the menu items truly menu items? Menu items should not be used as text, section titles, or status indicators.
- In a hierarchical menu, does the title of the submenu have a right-pointing triangle? Are submenus used only for lists of related items?
- Can the user see all the commands, items, and submenu titles in a menu without scrolling? Scrolling should be necessary only for menus that users have added to or for menus that spill over because the user has selected a large system font.
- If the application is text oriented, can the user change the font and style with menu commands or the system Font dialog?
