A user invokes the Assistant by tapping the Assist button, which is a picture button that looks like a light bulb. Before tapping the Assist button, a user can write an action request or select existing text to be used as a request. When a user taps the Assist button the system passes the Assistant any currently selected text. If no text is selected, then the system passes the Assistant the most recently written text. The Assistant classifies the words in that text as actions, targets of actions, or unknown entities. Depending on the results of this analysis, the Assistant may attempt to complete a task or it may prompt the user to supply additional information. [Figure 8-22](#page-264-0)  shows the Assist button initiating a fax operation.

Interpreting the Request Phrase 8  
The Assistant can attempt to complete an action only if it can construe one from the phrase the user writes or selects before tapping the Assist button. The Assistant is pre-programmed to know certain verbs that describe actions in the built-in applications. It can associate multiple verbs with a single action. For example, the Assistant performs the same task if given the word "phone," "call," or "dial." Applications can add words to the Assistant's lexicon, but users cannot.  
<span id="page-265-0"></span>The Assistant matches words regardless of their capitalization. For example, it considers the word "phone" to be the same as the word "Phone."  
The order in which a user writes words is not significant. For example, the phrase "Royce fax" produces the same result as the phrase "fax Royce." This syntax-independent architecture allows easier localization of applications for international audiences.  
The Assistant ignores words it does not know, giving users the freedom to write naturally. Rather than limiting the user to terse commands, the Assistant extracts meaningful words from phrases such as "Make a phone call to Bob at work" and ignores the others. There is a limit to this freedom, however. The Assistant does not attempt to interpret a phrase containing more than 15 words.
