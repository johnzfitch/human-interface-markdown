You should begin by designing a black-and-white icon. In general, you should use an outline of one black pixel to create the icon border. Use a minimal number of black pixels in the icon so that the icon's appearance is noticeably different when selected. The Finder automatically inverts the black pixels and the white pixels when the user selects the icon to create the selected appearance. Figure 8-19 shows an example of a well-designed icon that changes significantly when selected.

If you use too much black or 50 percent gray in your icon, the icon doesn't appear significantly different when the pixels are reversed for selection. Figure 8-20 shows an example of an icon with too much black and 50 percent gray.
