Some views need to have many small, unnamed controls that respond like buttons when tapped. For example, a view that contains a map might respond to a user tapping a place on the map by displaying information about the place tapped. These **hot spots** may be visible or transparent.  
Make it clear what elements of a view are hot spots unless you want to hide them from users. If space and design considerations permit, give hot spots a distinctive look that users can learn means "tap here." Simple geometric shapes—such as circles, squares, and triangles—are possibilities. When a user taps a visible hot spot, highlight it to provide feedback. Users need feedback to reassure them that they have really tapped the hot spot.  
Hot spots that are very small and close together may have to be invisible to avoid cluttering the view they're in. Feedback is very important with small invisible hot spots, because a user can't be sure which hot spot he or she is tapping. One possibility is to display a list of all the hot spots near where the user tapped, and let the user select one of the listed spots by tapping it in the list. If the user taps a place where there aren't any nearby hot spots (a "cold" spot), the application can provide feedback by listing one item that explains the situation, such as "Nothing here." [Figure 3-21](#page-115-0) shows how the Time Zones application responds when a user taps one of its invisible hot spots.

Of course, sometimes the whole point of hot spots is to make users guess where to tap. Secret hot spots would be fine in maps meant to teach geography by exploration, for example.  
In addition to graphical hot spots, there can be hot spots in text. For example, double-tapping a word pops up a picker for editing the word (see ["Correcting](#page-196-0)  [Misrecognized Text" on page 6-29](#page-196-0)).
