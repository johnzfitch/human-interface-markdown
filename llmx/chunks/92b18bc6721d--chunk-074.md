There are two important principles behind the Edit menu:  
- M Anything the user can do, the user can also undo.
- Data can easily be moved from one part of a document to another part, from one document to another, and even between documents that are created by different applications or desk accessories. The Clipboard, a holding area for text or graphics, makes this possible.  
The Edit menu allows access to the operations that cut, copy, and paste selections, as well as to Undo, Select All, and Show Clipboard. You can add other items to the Edit menu if your application requires them—and if they're related to the standard items already there.  
All applications should support Undo, Cut, and Paste. This requires that the first five lines in the Edit be exactly as shown in Figure 38.39. Undo followed by a dotted line, then Cut, Copy, Paste, and Clear. Consistency in this menu is important even if your application doesn't itself make use of Undo, Cut, and Paste—these features are available to desk accessories only through the Edit menu.
