#### Forward Delete (Del)  
In most script systems, pressing Forward Delete performs a forward delete: the character following the insertion point is removed, shifting everything following the removed character one character position back. The effect is that the insertion point remains stable while it "vacuums" the character or selection ahead of it.  
You can support the keyboard combination Option–Forward Delete to delete the next larger semantic unit as described in the section "Using Modifier Keys With Arrow Keys" on page 282. Deleting more than one word ahead of the insertion point at a time using the keyboard can make users feel uncomfortable. Users prefer to select large amounts of text or content in a document with the mouse so that they have more control over the exact selection.  
If Forward Delete is pressed when there is a current selection, it has the same effect as pressing Delete (Backspace) or choosing Clear from the Edit menu.
