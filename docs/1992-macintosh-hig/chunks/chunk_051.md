People who have a speech or language disability may have normal to above-average cognitive ability but no capacity for oral communication. The speech or language disability may be caused by an injury or a stroke, for example. These people use computers for augmentative and assistive communication. For example, they can use a computer to generate speech. Many people with speech or language disabilities are not able to use the standard keyboard and mouse because of some associated physical disability. To address the needs of these people, augmentative and assistive communications software is designed to be used with a variety of alternative input devices. Such software communicates with applications, windows, dialog boxes, and the desktop by *emulating* keyboard and mouse input. Don't create any barriers in your application to this type of communication, such as designing your application to communicate *directly* with the hardware (especially the keyboard and mouse), or the augmentative and assistive software won't work with your product.
