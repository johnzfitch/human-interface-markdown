Simplicity and ease of use are fundamental principlesfor creating all types ofsoftware, but in iPhone content they are critical. As described in ["iPhone](#page-9-0) and Its Place in the User's World" (page 10), iPhone users are probably doing other things while they simultaneously view or use your content on iPhone. If users can't quickly figure out how to use your content, they're likely to move on to something else and not come back.  
As you design the flow of your content and its user interface, follow these guidelines to build in simplicity and ease of use:  
- Make it obvious how to use your content.
- Avoid clutter, unused blank space, and busy backgrounds.
- Minimize required user input.
- Express essential information succinctly.
- Provide a fingertip-sized target area for all links and controls.
- Avoid unnecessary interactivity.  
The following sections explain each guideline for simplicity and ease of use in more detail.  
#### <span id="page-21-0"></span>Make It Obvious  
You can't assume that users have the time (or can spare the attention) to figure out how your content works. Therefore, you should strive to make your web content instantly understandable to users.  
In a webpage, you should display the most important information and functionality prominently. Remember that users view your webpage in a small screen, probably with some of their attention elsewhere. As a result, panning, scrolling, or paging past irrelevant elements to find valuable information can be irritating.  
<span id="page-21-1"></span>For example, Apple's main website, shown in Figure 3-1, prominently displays featured products; users can get more information about them with a tap.

In an iPhone web application, the main function should be immediately apparent. You can do this by minimizing the number of controls from which users have to choose and labeling them clearly so users understand exactly what they do. For example, in the built-in Stopwatch function (part of the Clock application), shown in Figure 3-2, users can see at a glance which button stops and startsthe stopwatch and which button records lap times.

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>Avoid Clutter  
A webpage that is cluttered with many different sizes and styles of elements, different sizes and colors of text, and gratuitous images presents an unpleasant user experience. Viewed in the small iPhone screen, the negative effects of clutter are magnified, making webpagesthat might be acceptable on the desktop difficult to use on iPhone.  
In both webpages and iPhone web applications, it's important to avoid overloading users with a profusion of images and elements. Space is at a premium in the iPhone screen, so you should display only those elements that provide essential information or functionality in the current context. For the most part, avoid displaying elements and images that are purely decorative.  
<span id="page-22-1"></span>It's also important to avoid leaving too much blank space around your content. If blank space separates important content, users must pan orscroll past it to reach that content. If a lot of blank space is concentrated around the edges of your webpage, it makes your webpage look poorly laid out. Whether you're designing a webpage or an iPhone web application, you should use only enough blank space to make controls easy to tap accurately and to make images and text look uncrowded.  
#### Minimize Required Input  
Inputting information takes time and attention, whether users tap your controls or use the iPhone keyboard. If your application requires a lot of user input, either all at once or before users can begin using your content, it slows users down and can discourage them from persevering with your site.

Principles and Guidelines for Creating Great iPhone Content  
Of course, you often need some information from users to tailor the content or task to their needs, but you should balance this with what you offer users in return. In other words, strive to provide as much information or functionality as possible for each piece of information users provide. That way, users feel they are making progress and are not being delayed as they attempt to reach the important parts of your content.  
For example, a website that helps users purchase concert tickets might first ask usersfor input—such as artist name, concert dates, and locations—before displaying a list of concerts that meet these criteria. Finally, the website would give users a way to purchase the tickets they've selected. In an iPhone web application that performsthe same function, however, it's better to avoid requiring usersto supply a lot of information before they can get to the main purpose, which is to buy tickets. Therefore, this iPhone web application might first display a short list of the most popular concerts scheduled in the next few weeks. In this way, most users can make progress toward their goal before they have to supply the information required to make a purchase.  
Consider using cookies to store previously input information to avoid asking for it again. You can also use cookies to remember where users were the last time they accessed your webpage or application. Cookies can help you tailor your content to users as soon as they arrive at your content.  
<span id="page-23-0"></span>When you ask for input from users, consider using lists (or pop-up menus) instead of text fields whenever possible. It's usually easier for users to select an item from a list than to type words. By default, Safari on iPhone displays pop-menus in an easy-to-use, aesthetically pleasing way. See [Figure](#page-41-1) 4-13 (page 42) for an example.  
#### Express Information Succinctly  
When your user interface text is short and direct, users can quickly and easily absorb it. Therefore, identify the most important information, express it concisely, and display it prominently so users don't have to read too many words to find what they're looking for or to figure out what to do next.  
<span id="page-23-1"></span>To help you do this, think like a newspaper editor and strive to convey information in a condensed, headline style. Give controls short labels (or use well-understood symbols) so users understand how to use them at a glance.  
#### Provide Fingertip-Sized Targets  
If your layout places links and controls too close together, users must spend extra time and attention being careful where they tap and are more likely to tap the wrong element. A simple, easy-to-use user interface spaces controls and other user-interaction elements so that users can tap accurately with a minimum of effort. "Metrics, Layout [Guidelines,](#page-30-0) and Tips" (page 31) contains some specific metrics you can use in your layout.  
For example, the built-in Calculator application displays large, easy-to-tap controls that each have a target area of about 44 x 44 pixels. Figure 3-3 shows the Calculator iPhone application.  
<span id="page-24-2"></span>**Figure 3-3** The built-in Calculator application displays fingertip-sized controls

#### <span id="page-24-0"></span>Avoid Unnecessary Interactivity  
Interactivity, not including required user input, is often used to engage users' interest and imagination. For example,some webpages present elaborate entry pages users must passthrough before getting to the main content. Although an entry page might be acceptable in a webpage viewed on the desktop, when viewed on iPhone it merely prevents users from reaching your content quickly. In your iPhone solution, make sure you use interactivity to get users closer to their goal and avoid interactivity thatserves no functional purpose.  
Another form of interactivity in a webpage is the use of elements and images that hide their functionality until users interact with them by, for example, mousing over them. This design doesn't work well on iPhone for two reasons. The first is that you do not receive an event equivalent to a mouseover, so such elements and images do not reveal their functionality to iPhone users. The second is that this type of interactivity adds an unnecessary layer of indirection between users and the content they want to view. Therefore, you should avoid interactivity that can be replaced by simple, straightforward elements.  
<span id="page-24-1"></span>If you're designing an iPhone web application, your content is, by definition, interactive. However, you should examine your design and eliminate those interactive elements that don't provide essential functionality and consider replacing others with simple, clearly labeled controls.
