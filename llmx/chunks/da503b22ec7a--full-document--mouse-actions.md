#### Mouse actions

In general, just *moving* the mouse changes nothing except the location, and possibly the shape, of the pointer. Pressing the mouse button indicates the intention to do something, and releasing the button completes the action. Pressing by itself should have no more effect than clicking has—except in well-defined areas, such as scroll arrows, where it has the same effect as repeated clicking.

The central mouse function is pointing. Other important mouse actions are clicking, double-clicking, pressing, and dragging.
