#### Multiple Windows  
Some applications can keep several windows on the desktop at the same time. Each window is in a different plane. Windows can be moved around on the desktop much as pieces of paper can be moved around on a real desktop. Each window can overlap those behind it and can be overlapped by those in front of it. Even when windows don't overlap, they retain their front-to-back ordering.  
Each application may deal with the meaning and creation of multiple windows in its own way. Different windows can represent:  
• separate documents being viewed or edited simultaneously  
• related parts of a logical whole (such as the listing, execution, and debugging of a program)  
• different views of the same information (such as a spreadsheet and a graph that represent the same numbers  
The advantage of multiple windows is that the user can isolate unrelated blocks of information. The disadvantage is that the desktop can become cluttered, especially if some of the windows can't be moved. Some applications provide, in the menu bar, a Windows menu. This menu allows the user to quickly choose a window even though it may be out of sight under other windows.
