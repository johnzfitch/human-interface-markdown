Users can close a window by  
- choosing Close from the File menu
- pressing Command-W
- clicking the close button  
When a user closes a document window, your application should  
- decide what to do with unsaved data (see ["Saving, Closing, and Quitting](#page-104-0)  [Behavior" \(page 105\)\)](#page-104-0)
- store the window's onscreen position and size (so they can be used when the window is reopened)
