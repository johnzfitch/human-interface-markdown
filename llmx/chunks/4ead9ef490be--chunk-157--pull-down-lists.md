#### **Pull-Down Lists**  
Pull-down lists are similar to pop-up lists, but they're used to perform actions, rather than to set a state. In this respect, pull-down lists are somewhat like menus.  
Visually, pull-down lists differ from pop-up lists in that the controlling button's label never changes, and it's marked by a different symbol  $\nabla$ .
