<!-- Chunk 161 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 1188 -->
If an action might take a while, then the user should be able to cancel it by holding the Command key while pressing the period (.) key (as described in Chapter 3, "User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse"). In addition, sometimes it's convenient for buttons that perform a time-consuming action to have a stop state, to make it more obvious to users that they can interrupt the action.  
If you implement a button with a stop state, the button's appearance should change as shown below.

during second click (if any)

after action is finished or canceled  
The button's action should be started when the user completes the first click (by releasing the mouse button). Similarly, the button's action should be stopped when the user finishes clicking the stop button.
