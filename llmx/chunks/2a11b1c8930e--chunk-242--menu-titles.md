#### Menu Titles  
For pull-down menu titles, give the title of the menu and then describe what kinds of commands are in the menu. You provide the title of the menu because some menus on the menu bar are icons, not words. Figure 11-10 shows an example of this type of help balloon.

For pop-up menus, describe what to do with the menu. Don't give the menu a name. For example, you could say, "Use this pop-up menu to describe items you want to find."
