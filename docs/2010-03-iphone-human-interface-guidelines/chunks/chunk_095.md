You can display a badge on a tab to communicate with users in a nonintrusive, understated way. This type of feedback is suitable for communicating information that isn't critical to the user's task or context, but that is useful to know. The badge looks similar to the one Phone displays on the Voicemail tab to indicate the number of unheard messages: it is a red oval that appears near the upper right corner of the tab. The white text inside the oval provides the information.  
Associating a badge with a specific tab allows you to connect the information in the badge with a particular mode in your application, even when that mode is not the current one. Figure 6-15 shows an example of a badge on a tab.

Note that a badge can also be displayed on your application icon in the Home screen if you register for Apple Push Notification Service and users agree to allow badging. See "Enabling Push [Notifications"](#page-48-0) (page 49) for more information on how this works.
