Once the target market is defined, you should design an appropriate human interface. The kind and sequence of steps to be followed are:  
- 1. Identify and explore companion packages and competing packages. If 80% of the target audience owns and uses a given piece of software, one your proposed package is complementary to, it only makes sense to conform your package to the user interface of the other, already-familiar package. Competing packages give you a good grasp of what users already expect: unless your strength lies in marketing, your package should go beyond those already out. After all, they are probably preparing their own next generation.
- 2. Ferret out standards and guidelines. Get to know the computer on which you are developing. Read books like this. Look at the most popular packages. Make your design follow the philosophy you discover.
- 3. Select or design a metaphor. Make it familiar and make it intuitive. If you are doing personal-productivity software, we urge you to use the windowing interface. Not only have we spent millions of dollars researching, building, and testing it, but your users are familiar with it. If you are doing a different type of program, such as educational, select a metaphor these users will feel comfortable with and that is supportive of the task at hand.  
Always keep in mind that this "illusion" need not be connected in any way with the hardware or operating-system requirements of the computer: the fact that loading and saving are companion calls to ProDOS does not mean they should appear together within a program. In terms of work-flow, they are usually at opposite ends. Avoid copying the interface of your favorite language or utility: there are a great many primitive interfaces that we become so used to we think they are good. They are not.  
4. Writing the External Requirements Specification  
This specification should represent everything the user will see. The  
after a brief, 20-minute pause.  
Part of the specification process is to estimate document requirements. Not only does this enable you to plan early for writing needs, but it keeps you conciously aware of the documentation costs of new features. If you figure it will take twenty pages to document some neat little shortcut, you are more likely to drop it early.  
A final part is estimating scheduling. It is not within the scope of this book to cover scheduling, except to comment that invariably marketing, sales, and management want the project completed yesterday. A good rule of thumb for the real time that a project will take is to figure out how long it should take, double it, and go to the next higher time unit. In other words, if you can program this thing in three weeks (by programming 18 hours a day), then figure six months. This covers the five weeks your mother—in—law will visit, the total redesign after the coding is done, the publisher loosing the manuscript, and sales arguing they can't possibly sell it in that silly green package.  
Always keep in mind that the last 10% of the program will require 50% of the time. Then walk the tightrope between the true time (above) and the time that everyone else will let you get away with. And best of luck.  
The final function of a good External Reference Specification is to sell the design. Do not be afraid to explain why you have designed something the way you have. Remember that everyone everywhere is a self-proclaimed user-interface expert. The best way to keep from having to defend yourself and your design is to have dazzled everyone with your brilliant insights within the ERS.
