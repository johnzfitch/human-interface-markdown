Of all the windows that are open on the desktop, the user can work in only one window at a time. This window is called the active window. All other open windows are inactive. To make a window active, the user clicks in it (or uses an Open-Apple short-cut). Making a window active has two immediate consequences:  
- The window changes appearance: Its title bar is highlighted, the scrolling apparatus is shown in the scroll bars, and a size or grow box is shown. If the window is being reactivated, the selection that was in effect when it was deactivated is rehighlighted.
- The window is moved to the frontmost plane, so that it's shown in front of any windows that it overlaps.  
Clicking in a window does nothing except activate it. To make a selection in the window, the user must click again. When the user clicks in a window that has been deactivated, the window should be reinstated just the way it was when it was deactivated, with the same position of the scroll box, and the same selection highlighted.  
When a window becomes inactive, all the visual changes that took place when it was activated are reversed. The title bar becomes unhighlighted, the scrolling apparatus isn't shown in the scroll bars, the size box isn't shown, and no selection is shown in the window.
