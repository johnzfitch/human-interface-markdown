Typing any printing character will automatically insert that character into the input line at the current cursor position.  
Pressing Return with the cursor anywhere within the input line will accept the entire input.  
Default responses are displayed with the cursor at the beginning or end of the response. Pressing Delete (or Control-D) as the first character will delete the entire response. Once any other key has been pressed, Delete and Control-D revert to their standard definitions.  
The blinking-bar cursor is, theoretically, a vertical bar that lies between two characters, representing an insertion-point. Because of hardware limitations in the text mode of the Apple II, text-based applications use a blinking underscore that alternates with the character that is to the right of the theoretical position. Thus, what in graphics environments looks like this:  
A turnbuckle A turnbuckle  
in text-mode looks like this:  
A t\_rnbuckle A turnbuckle
