It's often said that people spend no more than a minute or two evaluating a new app. When you make the most of this brief period by presenting useful content immediately, you pique the interest of new users and give all users a superior experience.  
**Important:** Don't tell people to reboot or restart their devices after installing your app. Restarting takes time and can make your app seem unreliable and hard to use.  
If your app has memory-usage or other issuesthat make it difficult to run unlessthe system hasjust booted, you need to address those issues. For some guidance on developing a well-tuned app, see "Use Memory Efficiently" in *iOS App Programming Guide* .  
**As much as possible, avoid displaying a splash screen or other startup experience.** It's best when users can begin using your app immediately.

#### **Avoid asking people to supply setup information.** Instead:  
- **Focus on the needs of 80 percent of your users.** When you do this, most people won't have to supply any settings, because the app is already set up to behave the way they expect. If there is functionality that only a few users might want—or that most users might want only once—leave it out.
- **Get as much information as possible from other sources.** If you can use any of the information people supply in built-in app or device settings, query the system for these values; don't ask people to enter them again.
- **If you must ask for setup information, prompt people to enter it within your app.** Then, store this information assoon as possible (potentially, in your app'ssettings). This way, people aren't forced to switch to Settings before they get the chance to enjoy your app. If people need to make changesto thisinformation later, they can go to the app's settings at any time.  
**Delay a login requirement for as long as possible.** It's best when users can navigate through much of your app and use some of its functionality without logging in. For example, App Store doesn't ask users to log in until they decide to buy something. Users often abandon apps that force them to log in before they can do anything useful.  
If users must log in, display in the login view a brief, friendly explanation that describes the reasons for the requirement and how it benefits users.  
**Think carefully before providing an onboarding experience.** (Onboarding introduces an app's features and explains how to perform common tasks.) Before you consider onboarding, make every effort to design your app so that all its features and tasks are intuitive and easily discoverable. *Onboarding is not a substitute for good app design* . If you still feel that onboarding is necessary, follow these guidelinesto create a brief, targeted experience that doesn't get in the user's way.  
- **Give users only the information they need to get started.** A good onboarding experience shows users what to do first or briefly demonstrates a few of the features that most users are interested in. If you give too much information to users before they have a chance to explore your app, you make usersresponsible for remembering details they don't need right away and you may send the message that your app is hard to use. If additional help is needed for specific tasks, provide that help only when the user is performing those tasks.
- **Use animation and interactivity to engage users and help them learn by doing.** Add text sparingly and only if it enriches the experience; don't expect users to read long passages. For example, don't describe how to perform a simple task when you can use animation to show users what to do. To lead usersthrough a more complex task, you might add transient overlay views that briefly describe each step as the user is about to do it. As much as possible, avoid displaying screenshots of your app because they're not interactive and users can confuse them with app UI.  
● **Make it easy to dismiss or skip the onboarding experience.** After users have viewed the onboarding experience, they probably don't want to view it again; other users may not want to view it at all. Be sure to remember the choice users make and don't force them to make it every time they open your app.  
**Avoid asking users to rate your app too soon.** Asking for a rating too soon tends to annoy users and may decrease the amount of useful feedback you receive. To encourage well-considered feedback, be sure to give users a chance to form an opinion about your app before you ask them to rate it. For example, you might wait until users have visited a minimum number of different screens or performed a minimum number of tasks.  
**In general, launch in the device's default orientation.** On iPhone, the default orientation is portrait; on iPad, it's the current device orientation. If your app runs *only* in landscape orientation, you should always launch in landscape and let users rotate the device if necessary.  
**Note:** It's best when a landscape-only app supports both variants of landscape orientation—that is, with the Home button on the right or on the left. If the device is already in landscape, a landscape-only app should launch in that variant, unlessthere's a very good reason not to. Otherwise, launch a landscape-only app in the variant with the Home button on the right. (To learn more about supporting different device orientations,see "Respond to Changesin Device [Orientation"](#page-60-0) (page 61).)  
**Supply a launch image that closely resembles the first screen of the app.** iOS displays the launch image the moment your app starts—giving users the impression that your app is fast and giving your app enough time to load content. Learn how to create a launch image in ["Launch](#page-214-0) Images" (page 215).  
**If possible, avoid requiring users to read a disclaimer or agree to an end-user license agreement when they first start your app.** Instead, you can let the App Store display your disclaimer or end-user license agreement (EULA)so that people can accessit before they get your app. If you must provide these items within your app, be sure to integrate them in a way that harmonizes with your UI and balances businessrequirements with user experience needs.
