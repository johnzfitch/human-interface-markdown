Alerts display messages to inform users of situations that are notable or potentially dangerous.

An alert should contain only the following elements:  
■ *The application icon.* Because of the new window layering model (described in ["New in Aqua" \(page 21\)](#page-20-1), an icon is necessary to make it clear to the user which application is displaying the alert.  
If there is a critical need to warn the user of a potentially data-damaging operation, you may wish to use the caution icon over the application icon, as shown in [Figure 6-3](#page-75-2).

- *Alert message text.* This text, in boldface system font, provides a short, simple summary of the error or condition that summoned the alert. Often the message is presented as a question.
- *Informative text.* This text appears in the small system font and provides a fuller description of the situation, its consequences, and how to get out of it. For example, a warning that an action cannot be undone is an appropriate use of informative text.
- <span id="page-75-4"></span><span id="page-75-3"></span>■ *Buttons* for addressing the alert. Button names should correspond to the action the user performs when pressing the button—for example, Erase, Save, or Delete.
