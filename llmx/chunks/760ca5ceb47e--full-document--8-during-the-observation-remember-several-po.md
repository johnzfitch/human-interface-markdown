#### **8. During the observation, remember several pointers:**

- Stay alert. It's very easy to let your mind wander when you're in the seventh hour of running subjects. A great deal of the information you can obtain is subtle.
- Ask questions or prompt the participant. Make sure you have a tester protocol that spells out how frequently you prompt and what you say. Your interruptions shouldn't be frequent, but when a participant is hesitating or saying, "Hmmm," ask what the participant is thinking about.
- Be patient; it is very easy to become impatient when someone is taking a long time. The participant is doing you a favor and is probably somewhat nervous. Anything you can do to alleviate the participant's insecurities and put the participant at ease will provide you with much richer data.
