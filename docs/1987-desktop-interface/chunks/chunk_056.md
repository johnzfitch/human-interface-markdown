An interesting variation on scroll boxes is the proportional scroll box. Instead of being a constant size, it starts out (in an empty document) filling the full length of the vertical scroll bar, indicating that all of the document isvisible in the window. Then, as content is added to the document, the scroll bar shrinks proportionally (though itnever gets smaller than a minimum size). In other words, as the amount of the document that the user can't see grows, the scroll bar's gray area grows too.
