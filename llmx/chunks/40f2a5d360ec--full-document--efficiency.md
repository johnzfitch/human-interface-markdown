## **Efficiency**

The user should be able to perform the desired task in as little (perceived) time as possible, with the minimum (perceived) complexity. Match the program to the skill level of the user. If you are doing a pricing program for a shopkeeper, do not ask her what her historic elasticity of demand has been without letting her know what it is and giving her the tools to estimate it. (Also, the question may be unnecessary: the fact that you asked it in a similar program you wrote for a Fortune 500 company is no reason to ask it of a shopkeeper.)
