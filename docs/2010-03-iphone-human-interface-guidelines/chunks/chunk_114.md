<span id="page-99-1"></span>iPhone OS does not include multi-item selection controls analogous to menus or pop-up menus, but a table view works well to display a list of options from which the user can choose. This is because table views display items in a simple, uncluttered way. In addition, the table view provides a checkmark image that shows users the currently selected option (or options) in a list, as shown in [Figure](#page-99-1) 8-12 (page 100).

If you need to display a list of choices users see when they tap an item in a table row, you can use either style of table view. But if you need to display a list of choices users see when they tap a button or other user interface element that is not in a table row, use the plain style.  
■ **Navigating hierarchical information**.  
A table view works well to display a hierarchy of information in which each node (that is, list item) can contain its own subset of information, because each subset can be displayed in a separate list. This makes it easy for users to follow a path through the hierarchy by selecting one item in each successive list. The disclosure indicator element tells usersthat tapping anywhere in the row revealsthe subset of information in a new list, as shown in [Figure](#page-100-0) 8-13 (page 101).

When a table is used for navigation, previously selected table rows do not remain highlighted when users retrace their steps through the hierarchy.
