The user *clicks* an object by positioning the cursor over it, then pressing and releasing a mouse button. Usually the mouse isn't moved during a click, and the mouse button is quickly released after it's pressed. However, timing generally isn't important. What's important is what object the cursor is over when the mouse button is pressed and released.  
Clicking is used to pick an object or a location on the screen. If the object is a window, the click brings it to the front and may select it to receive characters from the keyboard. If the object is a menu command, button, or other control, the click performs the control's action. In text, a click selects the *insertion point* (the place where the user's typing will be entered). In a graphics editor, it may select the location for a Paste command.  
#### **Multiple-Clicking**  
The user *double-clicks* an object by positioning the cursor over it, then quickly pressing and releasing a mouse button twice in succession. The mouse button must be pressed the second time within a short interval of the first, or the action will count as two successive clicks rather than a double-click. In addition, the cursor can't move significantly during the interval. This is to guarantee that the double-click remains focused on a single location on-screen.  
With the Preferences application, users can set the maximum length of the time interval between clicks to suit their individual needs.  
The user *triple-clicks* an object by rapidly pressing and releasing a mouse button three times in succession. The time interval between successive clicks and the distance the cursor can move between the first and the last click are subject to the same constraints that apply to a double-click.  
#### **Programming Note: The Mouse**  
All the controls provided by the Application Kit automatically turn the mouse actions they recognize (such as clicks) into the result specified by the programmer (such as bringing up a pane!). The Text object also automatically receives and reacts to mouse actions such as clicks, double-clicks, triple-clicks, and dragging actions.  
If you implement a custom control or a custom content area, you'll probably have to write code to handle the mouse actions that the control or area responds to.  
#### **Dragging**  
The user *drags* by pressing a mouse button and moving the mouse (and cursor) while the button is down.  
In general, every dragging action implies a click. Dragging a window, for example, also brings it to the front, as if it had been clicked. However, sometimes it's appropriate to separate an object's response to dragging from its response to clicking. See "When Dragging Shouldn't Imply Clicking," later in this chapter, for infonnation on when dragging should not imply a click.  
#### **Pressing**  
The user *presses* an object on-screen by positioning the cursor over it, pressing a mouse button, and holding the button down for a period of time. Although pressing implies clicking (since the mouse button must be released sometime), an object is said to be pressed rather than clicked if releasing the mouse button too soon would cut the action short.  
Control objects that respond to pressing act immediately when the mouse button is pressed. They don't wait for the button to go up.  
#### **Mouse Responsiveness**  
The cursor moves on-screen when the us.er moves the mouse, but the ratio of the two movements isn't one-to-one. Rapid mouse movements move the cursor farther than slow ones. Users can set the *mouse scaling,* how responsive the cursor is to mouse movements at different speeds, with the Preferences application.  
#### **Left and Right Orientation**  
To start, the two buttons of the mouse work identically: Either button can be used for the ordinary operations of clicking, dragging, and pressing.  
The two buttons can be differentiated with the Preferences application. Users can enable one of the buttons, either the right or the left, for the special function of bringing the main menu to the cursor. (See "Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor" in Chapter 6, "Menus," for details.) Thereafter, the enabled button has only that function, and it can't be used for ordinary mouse operations. This leaves the other button as the one that will be primarily used.
