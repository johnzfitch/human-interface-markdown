Whenever your application displays a window on the screen, you must decide where to put it and how big it should be. To determine where to place a window, consider what kind of window your application is opening, what other windows are open and where, and the relationship between the content of the window and other windows or dialog boxes. Whenever a change has been made to the initial size or location of a window, maintain the user's preferred size and position for the window.  
The sections that follow present examples for the most common situations. You should consider how your application compares to these common situations to determine the best ways to position your application's windows, including dialog boxes and alert boxes.
