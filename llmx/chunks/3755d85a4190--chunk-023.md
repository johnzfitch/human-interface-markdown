At Apple Computer, products are designed with a number of basic principles of human-computer interaction in mind. This chapter discusses the human interface design principles that describe key considerations for the design decisions you make for your product.  
Having technical knowledge of the Macintosh user interface is a key factor in product design, but understanding the theories behind the user interface can help you create an excellent product. This chapter provides a theoretical base for the wealth of practical information on implementing the Macintosh interface elements presented in Part Two.
