To promote a consistent user experience (and to make your job easier), iPhone OS provides numerous standard buttons for use in navigation bars and toolbars, and icons for use in tab bars.  
This chapter describes the standard icons and buttons available to you and provides guidelines on how to use them appropriately. You should familiarize yourself with the buttons and icons in this chapter regardless of the type of application you're developing, so that you can:  
- Use the system-provided items correctly
- Avoid designing a custom icon that looks too similar to a system-provided icon
