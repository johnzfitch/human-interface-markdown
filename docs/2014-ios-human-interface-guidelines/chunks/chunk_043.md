iOS provides a wealth of technologies that support common tasks and scenarios in ways that users expect. This expectation means that it's almost always better to integrate system-supported technologies into your app than it is to design a custom approach.  
Some iOS technologies—such as ["Multitasking"](#page-94-0) (page 95) and ["VoiceOver"](#page-134-0) (page 135)—are system features that all apps should incorporate. Others enable specific app functionality, such as handling tickets and gift cards(["Passbook"](#page-91-0) (page 92)), enabling user purchases within an app ("In-App [Purchase"](#page-104-0) (page 105)), displaying in-app advertising ("iAd Rich [Media](#page-113-0) Ads" (page 114)), integrating with "Game [Center"](#page-106-0) (page 107), and supporting ["iCloud"](#page-101-0) (page 102).
