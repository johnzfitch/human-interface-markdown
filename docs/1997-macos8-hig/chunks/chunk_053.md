When you position or align text in dialog boxes and alert boxes, you should take into account the characteristics of the font used. Apple Computer strongly recommends the Chicago font as the metric basis for making text alignment decisions. Use of any other font as a metric basis may result in incorrect text spacing when displayed in a different font. Additionally, text smaller than 12-point Chicago sometimes cannot be localized.  
When a dialog box is localized for worldwide versions of system software, the text in the dialog box may become longer or shorter. The alignment of the items in the dialog box may vary with localization. For example, Arabic and Hebrew are written right to left, so the items in an Arabic or Hebrew dialog box should be aligned on the right. Be sure to create dialog items of the same size, so that they align properly when a user has a script that reads from right to left.  
In general, you should use the system font for all controls. You should use the small system font only when space is limited or you need to present large amounts of textual information. Use Geneva 10 as a metric basis for small system font layout.  
Use the emphasized version of the small system font for headings. The headings can either be static text labels, controls, or group box titles. Using the emphasized version sparingly increases its impact.
