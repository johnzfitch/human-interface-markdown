<span id="page-190-3"></span>If your application is not document-based, use the name of your application as the window title. If your application has a short name, use it as the title.  
<span id="page-190-6"></span><span id="page-190-2"></span>Name a new document window "untitled"; leaving it lowercase makes it more obvious that the window doesn't have a name and encourages people to save the document. If the user chooses New again before saving the first untitled window, name the second window "untitled 2," and so on. Add numbers to window titles only when there is more than one open untitled window. Don't put a "1" on the first untitled window, even after the user opens other new windows.

If the user dismisses all untitled windows by saving or closing them, then the next new document should start over as "untitled," the next should be "untitled 2," and so on.
