Carroll, J. M., and others. "Interface Metaphors and User Interface Design." In *Handbook of Human-Computer Interaction*, edited by M. Helander. North-Holland: Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., 1988.  
A comprehensive review of research and theoretical work on metaphors, coupled with a discussion of designing with metaphors.  
Erickson, T. D. "Working With Interface Metaphors." In *The Art of Human Computer Interface Design*, edited by Brenda Laurel. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1990.

Lakoff, George, and Mark Johnson. *Metaphors We Live By*. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1980.  
A delightful book that discusses the ubiquity of metaphors in language. It makes the point that metaphors are not so much picturesque uses of words, as systems of concepts that affect how we describe, think about, and experience the world.
