**Metal buttons** are for use in brushed metal windows.  
Metal buttons:  
- Can contain icons, graphics, or text
- Can have the behavior of other types of buttons, including radio buttons or checkboxes  
Don't use metal buttons in dialogs. Dialogs should never use the brushed metal look. See ["Brushed](#page-110-0) [Metal Windows"](#page-110-0) (page 111) for guidelines on when to use brushed metal windows.  
If a button acts on a single setting, label the button as specifically as possible.
