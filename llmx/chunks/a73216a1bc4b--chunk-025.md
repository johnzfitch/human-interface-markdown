<!-- Chunk 25 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 265 -->
All aspects of the user interface are represented by graphical objects displayed on-screen, and all graphical objects are operated mainly by the mouse, not the keyboard. The keyboard is principally used for entering text. The mouse is the more appropriate instrument for a graphical interface.  
Nevertheless, it's often a good idea to provide keyboard alternatives to mouse actions (see "Keyboard Alternatives" in Chapter 3, "User Actions: The Keyboard and Mouse"). They can be efficient shortcuts for experienced users. Keyboard alternatives are always optional, however. Visual representations on the screen never are. A keyboard operation without a corresponding mouse-oriented operation on-screen isn't appropriate.  
One of the goals of the user interface is to extend to mouse operations the same naturalness and consistency that the keyboard provides for experienced typists. This is possible only if mouse operations follow established paradigms that users can come to rely on. The next section defines the paradigms used in the NeXTSTEP user interface.
