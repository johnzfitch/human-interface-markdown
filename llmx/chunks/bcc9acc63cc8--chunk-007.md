<!-- Chunk 7 | Source: 1986-07 Human Interface Guidelines (Second Beta Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 208 -->
Good human interface involves a friendly dialog between the person and the computer. If dialog is not clear, the user becomes confused and frustrated. One measure of the success of an interface is the user's ability quickly to learn it and to be efficient and productive with it.  
In person—to—person terms: you send me a message; I receive and decode it and offer a reply. When a message is not clear, one of us requests clarification. A computer equivalent might be: the user selects a program icon and then chooses Open from the File menu. The computer interprets that message as "open the XXX application"—and does it. Or the user selects a disk icon and chooses Erase from the Special menu. With a dialog box, the computer asks for clarification of risky operations—for example, "Are you sure you want to erase 1985 Tax Info?"
