<span id="page-172-2"></span>Apple Help debuted in Mac OS 8.5 and has evolved with each system software release. With Mac OS X, Apple Help has been fully updated for Carbon and introduces the following changes and enhancements:  
- new APIs for registering help books and calling the Help Viewer
- support for "look-up anchor" for use with contextual help
- addition of Developer Help Center for technical documentation
- Help is now packaged within applications
- all features from Mac OS 9 Apple Help, with the exception of launching Apple Guide sequences, which is no longer supported  
In addition, Apple continues to refine the design and information architecture of Mac Help, the onscreen help provided for the Mac OS and Macintosh hardware. The emphasis is on optimizing for onscreen usability, search-driven navigation, and Internet delivery.
