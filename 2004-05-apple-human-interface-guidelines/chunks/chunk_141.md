When the user attempts to close a document that has unsaved changes, present a Save Changes alert. An application that saves the contents of individual windows—such as most text and graphics applications—should use document-specific sheets, like the one shown in Figure 9-12, for its Save Changes alert. In an application that can display multiple views of the same file, if the user chooses the Close File command instead of Close Window, open the sheet on the frontmost window and change the alert message text from "document" to "file". After the user clicks Save or Don't Save, close all open views of the file.
