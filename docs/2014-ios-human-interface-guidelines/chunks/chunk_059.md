Mail is one of the most highly visible, well-used, and appreciated appsin OS X. It is also a very powerful program that allows users to create, receive, prioritize, and store email, track action items and events, and create notes and invitations. Mail on the desktop offers this powerful functionality in a couple of windows.

Mail on iPhone focuses on the core functionality of Mail on the desktop, helping people to receive, create, send, and organize their messages. Mail on iPhone delivers this condensed functionality in a UI tailored for the mobile experience that includes:  
- A streamlined appearance that puts people's content front and center
- Different views designed to facilitate different tasks
- An intuitive information structure that scales effortlessly
- Powerful editing and organizing tools that are available when they're needed
- Subtle but expressive animation that communicates actions and provides feedback  
It's important to realize that Mail on iPhone isn't a better app than Mail on the desktop; rather, it's Mail, redesigned for mobile users. By concentrating on a subset of desktop features and presenting them in an attractively lean UI, Mail on iPhone gives people the core of the Mail experience while they're mobile.  
To adapt the Mail experience to the mobile context, Mail on iPhone innovates the UI in several key ways.  
**Distinct, highly focused screens.** Each screen displays one aspect of the Mail experience: account list, mailbox list, message list, message view, and composition view. Within a screen, people scroll to see the entire contents.

**Easy, predictable navigation.** Making one tap per screen, people drill down from the general (the list of accounts) to the specific (a message). Each screen displays a title that shows people where they are, and a back button that makes it easy for them to retrace their steps.  
**Simple, tappable controls, available when needed.** Because composing a message and checking for new email are primary actions people might want to take in any context, Mail on iPhone makes them accessible in multiple screens. When people are viewing a message, functions such as reply, move, and trash are available because they act upon a message.

When people send a message, they can see its progress; when the send finishes, they can hear a distinctive sound. By looking at the subtle text in the message list toolbar, people can see at a glance when their mailbox was last updated.
