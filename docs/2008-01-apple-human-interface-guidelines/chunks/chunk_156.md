<span id="page-141-3"></span>Icons for utilityapplications—which are used less often and not simplyfor fun or creative activities convey a more serious tone than those for user applications. Color in these icons is desaturated, predominantly gray, and added only when necessary to clearly communicate what the applications do.

Because utilityapplications are normallyfocused on a narrowset of tasks, it's best tokeep the number of elements in the icon to a minimum. The focus should be a single object that represents what the utility does. The perspective of utility icons is straight-on, as if they are on a shelf in front of you.
