**Push button:** The button height is 20 pixels. End caps are not adjustable. Text goes between end caps. **Small push button:** The button height is 17 pixels. 17 17 10 10 10 10 20 14 14 20 14 14  
- **Height:** 20 pixels (fixed), not including the shadow. For small push buttons, height is 17 pixels.
- **End caps:** 14 pixels wide (fixed). For small push buttons, 10 pixels.
- **Width:** Depends on button text. If you don't specify a wide enough button, the end caps clip the text. The standard width for OK and Cancel buttons is 69 pixels, as shown in Figure 7-1 (page 121). Push buttons used in other contexts may be sized differently if appropriate.
- **Text:** System font (13-point Lucida Grande Regular). If you need to use a font larger than the system font, use a bevel button instead. For small push buttons, use the small system font (11-point Lucida Grande Regular).
- <span id="page-121-3"></span>■ **Color:** All push buttons are clear except the default button, which uses the default color (in addition to pulsing).
- **Spacing:** Leave at least 12 pixels of space between buttons placed horizontally or stacked. For small push buttons, leave at least 8 pixels.
