A **group box**, like a separator (described in ["Separators"](#page-331-1) (page 332)), is used to break a window into distinct logical areas. A group box has a heavier look than a separator, which meansthat it provides a more pronounced differentiation of content. For example, the Expose pane in Expose & Spaces preferences uses group boxes to separate screen-corner functionality from keyboard and mouse shortcuts, as shown in Figure 15-90.
