There is one interface element for the input of geometric shapes. It can be a blank area in which users can draw, or it can contain dotted lines to cue users that the area accepts input. [Figure 6-12](#page-181-0) shows an example.  
Shape-input areas have the following capabilities:  
- **Recognition** Automatically recognize geometric shapes such as rectangles and other polygons, circles and ovals, and straight lines and curves.
- **Gravity** Automatically snap new line endpoints to nearby corners and midpoints of existing shapes.

- **Editing** Let users edit shapes—select, delete, copy-and-paste, duplicate, reshape, resize, and move.
- **Formatting** Let users set the line thickness of individual shapes and shape segments.
