<!-- Chunk 10 | Source: 1996 Newton 2.0 User Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 184 -->
This book begins with a chapter that describes Newton devices such as the Apple MessagePad, what people do with them, and how they differ from personal computers. The first chapter also presents important principles you should keep in mind when designing Newton software, and explains how to involve users in designing the interface. The rest of the chapters define various parts of the Newton 2.0 interface. They describe each interface element in general language and show examples of how to use the elements correctly. For the more technical reader, the book specifies dimensions, spacing, and other specific implementation details for the Apple MessagePad. The book concludes with a list of common interface mistakes and a glossary.
