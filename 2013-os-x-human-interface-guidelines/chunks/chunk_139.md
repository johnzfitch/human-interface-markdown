<span id="page-237-1"></span>A small subset of controls can use a display style that makes them suitable for use in the window-frame areas (that is, in the toolbar or bottom bar). The control and style combinations that you can use in window-frame areas are listed in Table 8-1.  
**Table 8-1** Control and style combinations designed for use in the window frame  
| Control (API name)                                                                        | Style                                                                         | Example |

| Round<br>textured<br>button<br>(NSButton)                                                 | NSTexturedRounded<br>BezelStyle                                               |         |

| Round<br>textured<br>pop-up<br>menu<br>(NSPopUpButton<br>with<br>PopUp<br>attribute<br>*) | NSTexturedRounded<br>BezelStyle                                               |         |
| Round<br>textured<br>pop-down<br>menu<br>(NSPopUpButton<br>with<br>PopDown<br>attribute)  | NSTexturedRounded<br>BezelStyle                                               |         |
| Search<br>bar<br>(NSSearchField)                                                          | Not<br>applicable<br>(the<br>correct<br>style<br>is<br>used<br>automatically) |         |  
\*Note that you can use the NSTexturedRoundedBezelStyle style of pop-up menu to place an Action menu in a toolbar (for more information about Action menus, see ["Action](#page-260-0) Menu" (page 261)).  
You can see examples of most of these types of window-frame controls in the Mail toolbar.

**Don't use the window frame–specific control styles in the window body.** The control and style combinations listed Table 8-1 have been specially designed to look good on the window-frame surface of the toolbar (or bottom bar). *These control styles don't look good in the window body* . Specifically, these control styles have a translucency that is designed to coordinate with the window-frame surface, and they include inactive and other appearances that don't harmonize with other controls and styles.  
**In general, don't use window-body controls or styles in the window frame.** All system-provided controls and styles other than those listed in Table 8-1 have been designed to look good in the window body and its content regions, and *should not be used in the window frame* . The exception is the icon button, which can be used in both window-frame and window-body areas. In general, apps reserve this type of toolbar control for preferences windows. To learn more about designing icons for toolbar icon buttons, see ["Designing](#page-120-0) Toolbar [Icons"](#page-120-0) (page 121). To learn more about using an icon button in general, see "Icon [Button"](#page-244-0) (page 245).  
If your window includes a bottom bar (which is not typical), you can use window-frame controls in the bottom bar. For some guidelines on creating a bottom bar, see ["Providing](#page-190-0) a Bottom Bar" (page 191).  
**Avoid combining text and icons within a toolbar control.** A toolbar button can contain either text or an icon. And, although each segment in a segmented toolbar control can contain either text or an icon, it's best to avoid combining text segments with icon segments in the same segmented control.  
Interface Builder makes it easy to add one of the system-provided images to a toolbar control, such as the plus sign, the accounts symbol, or the locked symbol. Some of these symbols are shown here in the controls in the Finder toolbar. For more information about the system-provided images, see ["System-Provided](#page-318-0) Icons" (page 319). If you need to design your own image to place in a toolbar control, see ["Designing](#page-120-0) Toolbar Icons" (page 121) for some metrics and guidelines.

**Important:** You must supply a descriptive label for each toolbar control you create so that users can customize the toolbar to display both icons and text. Users see a descriptive label below each toolbar control when they customize a toolbar to use the Icon & Text or Text Only display options. (Window-frame controls used in a bottom bar don't need external descriptive labels.)  
If you want to display text inside a toolbar control, be sure it's either a noun (or noun phrase) that describes an object, setting, or state, or that it's a verb (or verb phrase) that describes an action. Text inside toolbar controls should have title-style capitalization (for more on this style, see ["Capitalizing](#page-303-0) Labels and Text" (page 304)).  
**Accurately indicate the current state of a two-state control in a toolbar.** If you use a toolbar control that behaves like a checkbox or a toggle button, you may be able to benefit from the automatic highlighting that signifies the on state of the control. If you do this, be very sure that the control clearly indicates the correct state in the correct situation.  
If you put a two-state control in a toolbar, you should also provide two descriptive labels that can be displayed below the control. One label should describe the on (or pressed) state and one should describe the off (or unpressed) state. Finally, be sure to describe both of the states in the control's help tag, whether the control appears in a toolbar or a bottom bar. To learn more about the on-state appearance, see ["Appearance](#page-247-1) and [Behavior"](#page-247-1) (page 248).  
For example, Mail includes a toggled toolbar button that users can use to take their accounts online or offline (shown here in its pressed state). The "Go Offline" label that accompanies the pressed state changes to "Go Online" when the control is in its unpressed state.

To provide a toggle-style toolbar button that displays an on-state appearance, use an NSButton object with style NSTexturedRoundedBezelStyle, with which you've associated an image. Be sure the button cell's showsStateBy mask contains NSContentsCellMask. This means that AppKit uses the alternate image and title when the cell's state is NSOnState. However, to get the on-state effect do *not* provide an alternate image. If you're using Interface Builder, place a Rounded Textured Button object in your toolbar or bottom bar; in the Attributes pane of the inspector, set the mode to Toggle, provide an image, and don't provide an alternate image.  
To provide a segmented toolbar control that displays an on-state appearance, use an NSSegmentedControl object with style NSSegmentStyleTexturedRounded and mode NSSegmentSwitchTrackingSelectAny. If you're using Interface Builder, place a Segmented Control object in your toolbar or bottom bar; in the  
Attributes pane of the inspector, set the style to Textured Rounded and the mode to Select Any. Be sure to provide an image for the control (in Interface Builder, select an image from the Image combo box in the Attributes inspector).
