#### Menus  
Many of the menu guidelines may appear somewhat arbitrary—they are. It appears only happy coincidence that so many developers are making menus so similar. As with many aspects of human interface standards, what is important is that one standard be set so the poor user can get used to one way of doing things. It is not nearly so important what that standard is.  
A menu should display all choices legibly, using numbers for menu selection. Research has shown that people will learn a number on an often used menu as quickly as a letter, even though letters on the surface appear more friendly. ("Was that E for Edit or E for Erase?") Mnemonic letter schemes are a nightmare to translate, and well over half of computer users are not touch-typists. For these reasons and others, the vast majority of developers have settled on numbers.  
If you do settle on letters, for your own reasons, be sure to be consistent: don't make the user use numbers for one section of a program and letters for another.  
All sub-menus should allow the user to move to the next higher menu by pressing the ESCAPE key. The main menu should not have an ESCAPE key option, so that the user can feel confident about leaning on the ESCAPE key to get all the way back to the top level, without worrying about being bounced completely out of the program upon reaching the top level. Each menu should (redundantly) have a last option that will move the user back to the next highest level. The Main Menu's option should end the program.  
The following is an example of a menu using the standard menu format:
