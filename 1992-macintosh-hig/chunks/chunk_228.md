It's very tempting to use the words that you're familiar with when you're developing documentation, training materials, or elements on the screen. However, it's best to use terms that your *users* are familiar with and that are consistent across the Macintosh product line and developer products. Don't use technical jargon or computer science terminology. It's especially important not to use programming terms in menus, dialog boxes, or user books.  
Don't use file type names to refer to Finder documents that users see. Call documents by the terms that appear in the Kind column in Finder windows. Table 11-1 lists the terms to use in place of the four-character type names, as well as a few other preferred terms for user documentation.
