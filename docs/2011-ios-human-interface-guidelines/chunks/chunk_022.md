An iOS application, regardless of type, has a single window. Programmatically, the window provides the background on which you present all your app's content and functionality. But users are not aware of this window in the same way that they're aware of windows in a computer application. On an iOS-based device, users experience an app as a collection of screens, most of which appear sequentially.  
You can think of a screen as corresponding to a distinct visual state or mode in an application. An app might have many screens or just a few, and each screen can contain various combinations of views and controls.  
Users tend to think of an application screen and the device screen as identical, but the content of an app screen can extend far beyond the bounds of the device screen. For example, in the Contacts app on iPhone, the contact list is displayed in a single screen, even though the list is likely to contain enough names to fill the device screen several times over.
