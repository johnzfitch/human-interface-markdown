When people use your app, they do so with a goal in mind; people rarely use an app for the sole purpose of exploring itsfeatures. To ensure that your app enables people to achieve their goal in the most efficient, easiest way possible, make every feature tightly integrated with the solution you provide.  
**Avoid feature cascade.** It can be very tempting to add features that aren't wholly relevant to the main focus of your app, but doing so can lead to a bloated interface that is slow, complex, and difficult to use. Always ask yourself if a proposed feature directly supports the user's goal, and if it doesn't, leave it out.  
**Follow the 80-20 rule.** The 80-20 rule states that roughly 80% of users use only a handful of an app's features, while only about 20% of users might use most or all of the features. Thinking of your user audience in this way encourages you to emphasize the features that enable the main task and helps you identify the features that power users are more likely to appreciate.
