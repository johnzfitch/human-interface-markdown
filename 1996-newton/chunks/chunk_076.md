The Close box and large Close box are both picture buttons that contain the picture of a cross shaped like an ✕. Both buttons work in the same way. Tapping a Close box or a large Close box closes the container view in which the button appears.  
The differences between the Close box and large Close box are purely cosmetic. The large Close box is the same height as standard text and picture buttons. The frame around the ✕ is not part of the large Close box's picture. The Close box is slightly smaller than the large Close box, and its picture includes the frame around the ✕. Figure 3-14 compares the Close box and the large Close box.
