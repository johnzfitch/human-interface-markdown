Extensions are software that add a feature or capability to the operating system. An extension icon looks like a puzzle piece. Figure 8-41 shows the default icons that appear in the Finder if you don't supply a custom icon for your extension.

You can customize an extension icon by adding a graphic to the puzzle piece. You can display the puzzle piece in a horizontal or a vertical orientation with the protruding part facing any direction.  
One exception to the standard form for extension icons are icons that represent Chooser extensions. Chooser extensions appear in the Chooser and provide people with a visual idea of the service they are choosing. Chooser extension icons should look as much as possible like the devices they represent. Some examples of Chooser icons are shown in Figure 8-42.
