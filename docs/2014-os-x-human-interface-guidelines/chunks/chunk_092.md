A **dialog** is a window that is designed to elicit a response from the user. Many dialogs—the Print dialog, for example—allow users to provide several responses at one time.  
OS X provides three main ways to present dialogs.

**Document modal.** A document-modal dialog prevents the user from doing anything else within a particular document. The user can switch to other documents in the app and to other apps. Document-modal dialogs should be sheets, which are described in [Using](#page-151-0) [Document-Modal](#page-151-0) Dialogs (Sheets) (page 152).  
#### **App modal.**  
An app modal dialog prevents the user from interacting fully with the current app, although the user can switch to another app. An example of an app-modal dialog is the Open dialog  
(described in

The [Open](#page-159-0) [Dialog](#page-159-0) (page 160)).

**Modeless.** A modeless dialog enables users to change settings in the dialog while still interacting with document windows. The Find window in many word processors is an example of a modeless dialog.  
In addition to these main dialog types, OS X provides an alert, which is a special type of dialog that can be document modal or app modal. In general, if the error condition or notification applies to a single document, the alert is document modal (that is, a sheet). If the alert applies to the state of the app as a whole, or to more than one document or window belonging to the app, the alert is app modal. For guidelines on when to use alerts and how to design them, see [Alerts](#page-171-0) (page 172).
