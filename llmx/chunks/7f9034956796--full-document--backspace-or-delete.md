#### Backspace (or Delete)

The Backspace (or Delete) key deletes text or graphics. Generally, if a selection has been made, pressing Backspace (or Delete) deletes the selection without putting it in the Clipboard—and without deleting the character to the left of the insertion point. If there is no selection, pressing Backspace (or Delete) deletes the character to the left of the insertion point without putting it in the Clipboard. The Backspace (or Delete) key has an effect like that of the Clear command in the Edit menu.
