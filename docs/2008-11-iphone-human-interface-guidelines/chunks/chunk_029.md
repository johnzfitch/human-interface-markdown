iPhone applications can offer settings that define preferred application behaviors or configuration options users can set to change some functionality of the application. Settings that define preferred application behaviors, similar to preferences in desktop computer applications, are accessible in the built-in Settings application. Configuration options should be available within the application context; often they are on the back of the main view (for an example of this, see "Utility [Applications"](#page-20-0) (page 21)).  
As you design your iPhone application, you need to decide which method makes sense. Be aware that users must quit your application to adjust settings in the Settings application, so you should not provide settings that users need to set more than once. If you can simplify your application to make settings unnecessary, you should do so. See *iPhone Application Programming Guide* for more information about providing settings in your iPhone application.  
Configuration options should be offered within your application; typically, they are displayed on the back of a screen. Unlike settings, configuration options are likely to be changed frequently as users choose to see information from new sources or in different arrangements. You can react dynamically to changes users make to these options, because users do not leave your application to access them.
