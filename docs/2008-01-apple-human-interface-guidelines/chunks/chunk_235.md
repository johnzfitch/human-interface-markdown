A preferences window is a modeless dialog that contains settings the user changes infrequently. In general, the user opens a preferences window to change the default way an application displays an item or performs a task, closes the window, and expects the new settings to have taken effect. For some guidance on how to provide preferences in your application, see ["Preferences"](#page-77-0) (page 78).  
Often, an application needs to provide a set of preferences for each of several different categories of functionality. For example, Safari allows the user to set preferences for bookmarks, webpage appearance, RSS display, and security measures, among other things. Because these categories are unrelated to each other, itwould be confusingto displaysettings for all of them in one pane. Therefore, Safari (and many other applications) provides a preferences window with a toolbar that contains a toolbar item for each category. When the user clicks a toolbar item, the window displays a pane that contains the settings associated with that item. Figure 14-54 shows the General pane of Safari preferences.

If you choose to create a preferences window that uses a toolbar to switch among different categories of settings, make sure the toolbaris not customizable. This is because a toolbarin a preferenceswindow does not provide a shortcut to frequently used commands, but acts as a convenient way to group settings. In addition, you should remove the show/hide toolbar control in your preferences window toolbar (you can see this control in [Figure](#page-196-0) 14-4 (page 197)). This is because there is no need to hide the toolbar in a preferences window (hiding it would also hide all but the currently selected collection of settings), and because novice users might mistakenly click the toolbar control when they mean to click the close button.  
A preferences window should not include a resize control. In general, preferences windows do not need to display active minimize or zoom buttons. Remember that preferences windows are intended to provide users with a place to make adjustments to the way an application behaves, so there's seldom a need for preferences windows to be resized or to remain open for a long time.  
If you have changeable panes in your preferences window, the title of the window should be the title of the currentlyselected pane.For example, the title of thewindowshown in Figure 14-54 is "General" because the currently selected toolbar icon is labeled "General." (If your preferences window does not contain additional panes, the title should be "*Application Name* Preferences".) In addition, a changeable-pane preferences window should remember which pane the user selected the last time the window was open.
