<span id="page-160-1"></span>You need to provide at least the following files:  
- a 128 x 128 image (for Finder icons)
- a mask that defines the image's edges, so the operating system can determine which regions are clickable  
Icons that display in the Finder are viewed at different sizes: they can be magnified in the Dock, they can be previewed at full size, and users can specify a preferred size. For the best-looking icons at all sizes, you should also provide customized image files ("hints") at three other sizes: 64 x 64, 32 x 32, and 16 x 16.  
If you are creating an icon that will never change size—on a bevel button, for example—you can supply the image only at actual size.  
1. Create an illustration of the icon.  
Although you may want the final icon to look like a photograph, in most cases it's inadvisable to start with an actual photograph. An illustration provides much more flexibility for conveying a concept in a very small space. An illustration also gives you necessary control over details, perspective, light and shadow, texture, and so on.  
2. Create a three-dimensional version of the illustration.  
A 3-D modeling application can significantly enhance the final results. It can create more realistic lighting and texture effects, for example, and it's much easier to experiment with lighting, viewing angles, and so on.  
The light source should be above and slightly in front of the object. The resulting shadow should create the sense that the icon is resting on a surface.  
3. Add detail as desired.  
For each enhancement you make to a larger-version icon, consider whether it is truly adding something to the icon's usability, or whether it is just adding complexity or clutter.  
4. In an image-editing program, manipulate the image to get precise effects and create the icon mask.  
5. Convert the icon to a .icns resource or file.
