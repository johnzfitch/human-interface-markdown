<span id="page-252-3"></span><span id="page-252-2"></span>A **combination box** (or combo box) is a text entryfield combinedwith a drop-down list. Combo boxes are useful for displaying a list of likely choices while still allowing the user to type in an item not in the list.  
The user can type any appropriate characters into the text field. If the user types in an item already in the list, or types in a few characters that match the first characters of an item in the list, the item is highlighted when the user opens the list. A user-typed item is *not* added to the permanent list.  
The user opens the list by pressing or clicking the arrow to the right of the text field. The list is a window that descends from the text field; the window is the same width as the text field plus the arrow box, and has a drop shadow. Don't extend the right edge of the list beyond the right edge of the arrow box; if an item is too long, it is truncated.  
When the user selects an item in the list, the item replaces whatever is in the text entry field and the list closes. If the list was opened by pressing the arrow, the user selects an item in the list by dragging to it. If the list was opened by clicking the arrow, the user selects an item by clicking it or by pressing the Up Arrow or Down Arrow keys. The user can accept an item by pressing the Space bar, Enter, or Return.  
<span id="page-252-1"></span>If the list is open and the user clicks outside it, including within the text entry field, the list closes.

The default state of the combo box is closed,with the text field emptyor displayinga default selection. The default selection (not necessarily the first item in the list) should provide a meaningful clue to the hidden choices. The combo box should also have a useful label.  
**Carbon:** Combo boxes are available in Interface Builder. To create them programmatically, use the HIComboBoxCreate function or DrawThemeButton with the appropriate constant.  
**Cocoa:** Combo boxes are available in Interface Builder. Use the NSComboBox class. See *Combo Boxes* in Cocoa User Experience Documentation.
