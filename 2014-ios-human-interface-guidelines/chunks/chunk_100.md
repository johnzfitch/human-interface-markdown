A **scope bar**—which is available only in conjunction with a search bar—helps users define the scope of a search.

**API Note:** To learn more about defining a search bar and scope bar in your code, see "Search Bars".  
When a search bar is present, a scope bar can appear near it. A scope bar adopts the same appearance that you specify for the search bar.  
It can be useful to display a scope bar when there are clearly defined or typical categories in which users might want to search. However, it's even better to improve search results so that users don't need to scope their search.
