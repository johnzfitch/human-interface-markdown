#### Paste

Paste is the last stage of a move or copy operation. It inserts the contents of the Clipboard into the document, replacing the current selection. If there is no current selection, it's

inserted at the insertion point (or at the application's equivalent of an insertion point). The user can choose Paste several times in a row to paste multiple copies. After a paste, the new selection is the object that was pasted, except in text, where it's an insertion point immediately after the pasted text. The Clipboard remains unchanged.

The Apple-V key combination is reserved as a keyboard substitute for Paste in the Edit menu and should be used for no other purpose.
