Many interface elements display a **contextual menu** when the user presses the Control key while clicking or pressing the item. The contextual menu provides convenient access to often-used commands associated with the item.

- **Behavior:** A contextual menu behaves like a standard pull-down menu, except that moving the pointer off a contextual menu and onto a standard pull-down menu doesn't activate the second menu; the user must click once to close the contextual menu and again to open the second menu.
- Contextual menus that are too long to display fully use the scrolling indicator (a downward-pointing triangle) and scroll like standard menus.
- Don't set a default item. If the user opens the menu and closes it without selecting anything, no action should occur.
- **Contents:** You define the items in your application's contextual menus. Include a small subset of the most commonly used commands in the appropriate context.  
<span id="page-62-4"></span>Never provide a contextual menu command that is not also accessible through the menu bar. Use submenus with caution and keep them to one level.
