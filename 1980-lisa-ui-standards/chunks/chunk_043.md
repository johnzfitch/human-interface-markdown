The Abbreviation Folder contains a table of abbreviations accessible with the CODE key. When the code key is held down and another key is typed, the entry for that key in the Abbreviations Folder is pasted in to replace the active selection. Entries in the Abbreviation Folder may be edited so the user can use abbreviations for common phrases, inside address, etc. For first release, the abbreviations might only be textual, but eventually they should include graphics too as in a logo or signiature.
