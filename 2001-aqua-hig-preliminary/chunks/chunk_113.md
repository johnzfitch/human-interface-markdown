If the user types faster than the computer can handle or when the computer is unable to process the keystrokes, they are queued for later processing. This queuing is called **type-ahead.** There is a limit (varying with the computer) to the number of keystrokes that can be queued, but it's usually not reached unless the user types while the application is performing a lengthy operation.  
When a character key is held down for a certain amount of time, it starts repeating automatically. The user can make adjustments to this feature, called **auto-repeat,** in Keyboard preferences. This feature works with modifier keys as well.  
An application can tell whether keystrokes are generated by auto-repeat or by the same key being pressed numerous times. Your application can disregard auto-repeat keystrokes; it probably should ignore them in keyboard equivalents.  
Auto-repeat works only when the application is ready to accept keyboard input; it does not function during type-ahead.
