Use sheets for dialogs specific to a document when the user interacts with the dialog and dismisses it before proceeding with work. Some examples of when to use sheets:  
- A modal dialog that is specific to a particular document, such as saving or printing.
- A modal dialog that is specific to a single-window application that does not create documents. A single-window utility program might use a sheet to request acceptance of a licensing agreement from the user, for example.
- Other window-specific dialogs typically dismissed by the user before proceeding. Use a sheet when a dialog benefits from being attached to the window as a modal dialog, even if you might otherwise design the dialog as a modeless dialog.
