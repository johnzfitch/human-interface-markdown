<span id="page-264-2"></span>Buttons initiate an immediate action. If a button initiates an indeterminate process, the button should be dimmed until the process is complete, and status feedback should be provided.  
If you need to offer two opposing functions, such as Reload and Stop in a browser, consider using two separate buttonsinstead of one dual-purpose button that changesstate. Providing one dual-purpose button can lead to the situation in which a user clicks the button when it is in one state, but the click is received and processed after the button has changed to the other state.  
If you must provide one dual-purpose button, be sure to keep track of when the button changes state so you can process the clicks appropriately. Also, be sure to provide immediate and informative feedback.  
<span id="page-264-1"></span>**Important:** The controls described in this section are suitable for use in the window body; they should not be used in the window-frame areas. The single exception is the icon button, which can also be used in a toolbar. See ["Window-Frame](#page-254-1) Controls" (page 255) for controls designed specifically for use in the toolbar and bottom-bar areas in your window.
