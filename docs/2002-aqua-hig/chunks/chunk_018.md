<span id="page-22-2"></span>If business reasons such as resource constraints or schedule commitments require you to adopt Aqua in stages, the following two lists can help you make decisions about which features to focus on first. To make your application feel at home on Mac OS X, it is most important for you to implement the following features (not in order of importance):  
- Install files in the proper locations (see ["Installing Files" \(page 245\)](#page-244-1) and don't abuse the Documents folder (see ["Where to Put Files" \(page 247\).](#page-246-0))
- Adopt the Aqua appearance and follow the layout guidelines provided in this document.
- Abide by the filenaming conventions (see ["Naming Files and Showing Filename](#page-248-1)  [Extensions" \(page 249\)\)](#page-248-1).
- Provide user assistance (see ["User Help and Assistants" \(page 235\)](#page-234-0)).
- Be aware of the Dock (see ["The Dock" \(page 41\)](#page-40-0).)
- Respect the accessibility features built in to Mac OS X version 10.2.  
To take full advantage of Mac OS X and to offer your customers the richest user experience possible, your application should also do the following:  
- Implement sheets and drawers (see ["Document-Modal Dialogs \(Sheets\)"](#page-95-0) [\(page 96\)](#page-95-0) and ["Drawers" \(page 88\)](#page-87-3)).
- Use the Dock to provide meaningful feedback to users (see ["Dock Notification](#page-41-0)  [Behavior" \(page 42\)\)](#page-41-0).
- <span id="page-22-1"></span>■ Use the AddressBook framework provided with Mac OS X version 10.2 to access and create contact information entered by users. (See *Inside Mac OS X: System Overview,* available on the Mac OS X developer documentation website.)
- Be speech-enabled (see ["Speech Recognition and Synthesis" \(page 253\)](#page-252-0)).
