#### **Panels**  
Although panels can look just like standard windows, they have a different role: They help perform secondary functionality, supporting the work done in standard windows. Often, they let the user manage the contents of standard windows in specific ways. For example, in a text editor, a standard window holds the document being edited, and panels appear as necessary to get information—for printing, saving, searching, and so on.

The Font panel shown above is an *ordinary panel*. Ordinary panels let the user work in other windows and panels of the application while the panel is displayed.  
Sometimes, however, a panel requires the user's immediate attention—for example, when the user must confirm a possibly destructive command. In this case, an *attention panel* is used. While an attention panel is displayed, the user can't do anything else in the application (although the user can work in *other* applications). Because attention panels work so differently from ordinary panels, they look different, as shown below.

Some panels, such as those shown in this section, have been standardized and are used in many applications. Using standard panels in your application helps the user be more productive, since the user has less to learn. Chapter 5, "Panels," gives more information about the standard panels and about creating application-specific panels.
