<span id="page-107-2"></span>iPhone OS providesthe standard icons described in Table 10-3 for use in tab bars. As with allstandard buttons and icons, it's essential to use these icons in accordance with their documented meanings. In particular, take care to base your usage of an icon on itssemantic meaning, not its appearance. This will help your application's user interface make sense even if the icon associated with a specific meaning changes its appearance. See "Using [System-Provided](#page-104-1) Buttons and Icons" (page 105) for further reasons why it's important to use these icons correctly.
