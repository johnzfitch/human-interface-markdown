#### **6. Describe in general terms what the participant will be doing.**

Explain what all the materials are (such as the set of tasks, disks, and a questionnaire) and the sequence in which the participant will use them. Give the participant written instructions for the tasks.

If you need to demonstrate your product before the user observation begins, be sure you don't demonstrate something you're trying to test. For example, if you want to know whether users can figure out how to use certain tools, don't show them how to use the tools before the session. Don't demonstrate what you want to find out. For example, rather than showing the participant what the final design outcome looks like and asking an opinion, you can show before and after screen shots and ask what the participant observes about each one.
