#### Shift

The Shift key, when held down at the same time a character key is pressed, produces the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys, or the upper character on two-character keys. The Shift key is also used in conjunction with the mouse for extending a selection or for constraining movement in graphics applications. For example, in some graphics applications holding down the Shift key while using a rectangle tool limits the tool to drawing squares.
