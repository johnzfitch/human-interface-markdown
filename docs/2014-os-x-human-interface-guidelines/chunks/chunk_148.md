People view Today widgets in the Today area of Notification Center. Because people configure the Today area so that it displays the information they value most, it works well to approach the design of your widget with the goal of earning a place among the user's most important items.

**Design an appearance that looks at home in Notification Center.** Notification Center uses the vibrant dark appearance, and your widget content should, too. Also, when you use the default margins provided by Notification Center, your Today widget gives users a consistent experience. In general, focus on drawing your content and not on drawing backgrounds or custom materials.  
**Note:** OS X automatically displays your app icon and title above your custom widget content (the icon appears in the leading margin).  
**In general, use the system font in the appropriate color to display text.** Specifically, choose the color that reflectsthe semantic meaning of your text,such as labelColor (for primary text) and secondaryLabelColor (for lessimportant text). When you use the system-provided colors, your text automatically getsthe appropriate vibrancy (to learn more about the system-provided colors, see Use System Colors to [Integrate](#page-38-1) With System [Appearances](#page-38-1) (page 39)).  
**Provide a Notification Center experience.** People visit Notification Center to get brief updates or to perform a very simple task, so it's best when your Today widget displays the right amount of information and limits interactivity. Specifically:  
- Avoid making users vertically shift the view to see all the information in your Today widget. A widget can expand vertically to show more information, but it's not a good experience when a widget's height takes up too much of Notification Center, because it interferes with scrolling to see other Today widgets.
- Avoid making users horizontally shift the view, because it might interfere with the dismiss Notification Center gesture. If you need a table view in your widget, be sure to use a fixed-size table view (that is, a table view that doesn't include a scroll view).
- Help users perform a task with as little interaction as possible. The keyboard is available to OS X widgets, but you don't want to encourage users to do a lot of typing.
- Optimize performance so that people get useful information immediately. It's a good idea to cache information locally so that you can display recent information while you get updates. People expect to spend very little time in the Today view, and iOS may terminate Today widgets that don't use memory wisely.  
**If appropriate, let people open your app from your Today widget.** Because your Today widget provides a narrowly focused experience, it can work well to direct people to your app for more information or functionality. It's not a good idea to provide an "Open App" button, so one solution is to make your entire Today widget clickable. Or you might let users click an appropriate UI object within the widget so that it opens your app to a view that's focused on that object. For example, the Calendar widget shows today's events; if users want to get more information about an event, they click the event in the widget to view it in the Calendar app.  
**Note:** Giving users a way to open your app from your Today widget can work well, but it's essential that you continue to provide useful, timely information in the widget. People may not appreciate a Today widget whose only function is to launch your app.
