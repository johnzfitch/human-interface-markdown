A Mac OS X user application icon has a diamond-like rotation designed to reinforce the emotional quality of an icon. The rotated object carries a direct meaning for the application and should represent the media created or viewed by the application. The perspective can be compared to objects on a desk. If you look at an object on your desk as it appears when you are sitting in your chair, you see the perspective from which Mac OS X user application icons are designed. This perspective (that is, looking down at a layered set of elements), combined with the superior aesthetic

capabilities of Mac OS X, allows the user to perceive icons as representing familiar objects. This familiarity helps the application become more approachable and non-threatening to novice users and enables you to design icons with the desired emotive quality; in other words, you can make an icon as fun or as serious as appropriate to its application. [Figure 1-32](#page-39-0) shows an example of a user application icon that clearly communicates its purpose in a way that invites the user to learn more about it.

Observe the use of color, curve, and shading in [Figure 1-32.](#page-39-0) Alpha channels allow for complex, soft shadows that emphasize the effect of layered elements as well as perspective. Alpha channels can also be used for transparency, so you can provide the effect of translucency, as seen in [Figure 1-33](#page-40-0). 32-bit color provides a vibrant color palette.

Aside from the overall shape and formal elements that you can use to design an application icon, you should also provide a supportive tool element whenever possible to communicate the type of task that an application allows the user to accomplish. The magnifying glass in [Figure 1-33](#page-40-0) is a good example of a tool element. The tool should closely relate to the base object that it rests upon and should be rotated in an opposite direction. Ideally, the user application icon should tell a story of how the application can be used. More examples of the supporting tool concept are shown in [Figure 1-34.](#page-40-1)
