There should be no secrets from the user, no abstract commands that only promise future results.  
There should be no significant difference between what the user sees on the screen and what eventually gets printed.  
A very important use of computers is the processing and printing of text and graphics. On some systems, the computer is an intermediary: the user manipulates a range of computer commands to indicate what is desired, and the computer passes these along to a printer. This keeps the user unnecessarily distant from the final document. The user should be in charge of both the content and the formatting (spatial layout as well as font choices) of the document. The computer should quickly and directly display the result of the user's choices, so the user doesn't have to wait for a printout or make mental calculations of how the screen version will be translated onto paper.  
The principle behind this approach is known as "what you see is what you get" (abbreviated WYSIWYG, pronounced "wizzy-wig"). This approach is highly consistent with the direct manipulation aspect of the Apple Desktop Interface. For example, when user uses the Finder to copy a document from one disk to another, he "sees" a copy of the document move to the new disk, and has faith that the document is now found on both disks. WYSIWYG is also in the spirit of using a computer as a thinking tool as well as a production tool.
