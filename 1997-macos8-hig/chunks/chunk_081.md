**Control panels** are appropriate for allowing users to configure:  
- settings with system-wide effects (for example, the Date & Time control panel)
- settings that have no visible effect (for example, the File Sharing control panel)
- hardware (for example, the Monitors & Sound control panel)  
Control panels are not appropriate for allowing users to configure specific applications or utilities, or tasks that would require multiple layered dialog boxes or custom menu items.
