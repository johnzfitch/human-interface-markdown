Color is made up of three elements:  
- Hue is what is usually meant by "color": whether it's red, blue, green, or yellow, and so on.
- Saturation is the purity of <sup>a</sup> color—rich, intense colors are highly saturated; dull or diluted colors are not very saturated. For example, pink is a low-saturation red; navy blue is a high-saturation blue.
- Brightness is how light or dark <sup>a</sup> color is—how much white is in it. Some pure hues are naturally brighter than others: yellow is the lightest hue; violet is the darkest. Bright colors attract the eye.
