## Note Alert Boxes

The note alert box is the first level of alert box. It contains the talking face icon. The note alert box provides nonthreatening information to the user. Usually note alert boxes have only one button, the OK button. In this case, the user can respond to the information only by acknowledging it. Figure 6-18 shows an example of a note alert box.

Use the note alert box to convey information that is useful to the user but doesn't present any threat such as a loss of data.
