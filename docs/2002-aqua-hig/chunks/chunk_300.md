- Does the window use either the standard scroll bar mechanism or the hand for scrolling? If it uses the hand, does the pointer either always become a hand in the window or appear highlighted in a tool palette?
- Does clicking a scroll arrow cause the document to move a distance of one unit in the chosen direction? (The unit should be appropriate and meaningful for the application.)
- Does clicking in the gray area move the document by a windowful (or to the pointer location, if the user has selected that option)?
- Are the scroll bars inactive when the entire document fits in the window?
- Are the scrolling keys on the keyboard (Page Up, Page Down, Home, End) supported? Note that these keys do not move the insertion point and do not affect the selection.
- Does the scroller indicate the approximate position of the visible part of the document in comparison to the whole document?
