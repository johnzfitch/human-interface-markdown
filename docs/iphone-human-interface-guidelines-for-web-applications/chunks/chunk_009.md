Although iPhone combines camera, phone, iPod, and email functionality, as far as your web content is concerned iPhone is a mobile web platform on which users view your webpage or use your web application. How users access web content, using iPhone network connectivity, browser capabilities, and the view screen, has a significant impact on both the behavior of your web content and users' perception of it.  
<span id="page-9-2"></span>The following sections briefly describe these parts of the iPhone web infrastructure, emphasizing how each part influences the design of your web content. For details on how to implement your webpage or web application to work well with this infrastructure, see *Safari Web Content Guide for iPhone OS*.  
#### Network Connectivity  
iPhone connects to either an available Wi-Fi network, which can be very fast, or the EDGE network, which is slower. As users move about, iPhone automatically switches to the service currently available to provide the fastest possible connection speed.  
As you design your web content, you should keep the adaptable connectivity of iPhone in mind. You can't predict what connection speeds users have at a given moment or know when iPhone switches from one network to another, so your content should be designed to work well at any connection speed. And when  
you optimize your content to be responsive at the slowest connection speed, users enjoy even better performance at higher connection speeds. See Creating Compatible Web Content for some specific optimization techniques you can use to enhance the performance and responsiveness of your iPhone content.  
#### <span id="page-10-0"></span>Safari on iPhone  
Safari on iPhone provides the interface for all web content on iPhone. Although Safari on iPhone is similar in many ways to Safari on the computer desktop, it is not the same. You need to work within the feature set Safari on iPhone makes available and provide workarounds if you typically use Safari features available on the desktop that are unavailable on iPhone. For information on all the differences between Safari on iPhone and Safari on the desktop and how to accommodate them, see Creating Compatible Web Content.  
Most Safari on iPhone features influence the implementation of your web content, but some have an impact on the design of your user interface. The following list describes those features you should keep in mind as you design the user experience and user interface of your web content.  
- Safari on iPhone supports cookies.
- This meansthat you can use cookiesto save the user's context, preferences, and previously entered data, which can streamline the user's interaction with your content by minimizing the amount of information users must supply.
- Safari on iPhone does not support Flash or Java (including Java applets) in iPhone content.
- In particular, be sure you avoid recommending that users download the latest Flash to their iPhone because neither Flash nor file downloads are supported by Safari on iPhone. Because of this constraint, the user interface of your web content should not rely on Flash animation to communicate with users.
- Safari on iPhone interprets most of the user's finger movements as targeting the way iPhone displays your content, not the content itself.
- The main exception to this is the tap, which is analogous to a single mouse click, and which can cause Safari on iPhone to send the onclick event to your webpage. As you design your user interface, keep in mind that the users should be able to use a tap to access and drive all functionality in your content ("The iPhone User [Interaction](#page-12-0) Model" (page 13) describesthe touch-based interface of iPhone). For more information on the events Safari on iPhone generates, see Handling Events.  
<span id="page-10-1"></span>Currently, Safari on iPhone does not support third party plug-ins. For a complete list of web technologies that Safari on iPhone does not support, see Creating Compatible Web Content.  
#### The iPhone Viewport  
For Safari on iPhone, the **viewport** is a rectangular area that determines how content is laid out and where text wraps on a webpage. On the desktop, the viewport is defined by the size of the browser window. Users resize the viewport on the desktop by resizing the window and they scroll to see more of the webpage, if necessary. But Safari on iPhone does not have resizable windows,so there are no scroll bars or resize controls. Figure 1-1 shows how the viewport differs between Safari on iPhone and Safari on the desktop.

Safari on iPhone Safari on the desktop  
As you design the user experience and user interface of your webpage, it's important to remember that iPhone users can change the scale of the viewport by zooming in and out, but not the size. The only exception to this is that when users change iPhone from portrait to landscape orientation, the viewport size changes. Under certain circumstances, Safari on iPhone may adjust the viewport width and change the webpage layout. Note that you can set the viewport size and other properties to improve the presentation of your webpage the first time it is rendered on iPhone. "Lay Out [Content](#page-32-0) for Safari on iPhone" (page 33) provides an introduction to configuring the viewport; Configuring the Viewport provides implementation details.  
When iPhone users pan or scroll to see more of a webpage, a gray bar appears at the right side or bottom of the iPhone screen to give a visual indication of how much more of the webpage there is to see. Although this is similar to the way the size of a scroller on the desktop indicates how much of the content is hidden, the gray bars Safari on iPhone displays are indicators only; they cannot be dragged.  
For webpages, there's nothing wrong with expecting users to zoom in to read text, but there are things you can do to make the zoom effective, such as presenting your text in relatively narrow columns of small, easily digestible blocks. This allows users to avoid panning back and forth to read long lines of text. For example, most online newspaper websites are designed to mimic the easy-to-read column layout used on paper, and this translates very well to iPhone.  
For a webpage that isintended to behave as an iPhone web application, however, you should avoid requiring usersto zoom in at all, because it impedes accessto your content and weakensthe perception of the webpage as a standalone application. To learn about how webpages on iPhone and iPhone web applications are defined, see "Content on iPhone: Is It a Webpage or an [Application?"](#page-14-0) (page 15).
