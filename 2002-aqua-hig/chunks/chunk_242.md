<span id="page-220-6"></span>Your application should check whether the Option key is pressed at drop time. This behavior gives the user the flexibility of making the move-or-copy decision at a later point in the drag-and-drop sequence. Pressing the Option key during the drag-and-drop sequence should not "latch" for the remainder of the sequence.  
**Note:** The Option key does not act as a toggle switch; Option-dragging between containers always initiates a copy operation. This guideline allows users to learn that Option means copy.
