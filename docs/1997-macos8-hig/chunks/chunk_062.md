A group box can have a title, but one is not required. When you use a title of any kind with a group box, align the base of the text with the inside white border line of the group box. There should be at least 3 pixels on each side of the title text.  
Under platinum appearance, group boxes have a 2-pixel border line— a 1-pixel white line next to a 1-pixel dark gray line. In laying out the group box, your measurements should be from the inside of these lines.  
Leave 10 pixels of space between the sides of a group box or the bottom of a group box and any items you place inside those borders. Leave 12 pixels of space from the inside top of the group box to the top of the first item within the group box.  
Figure 3-27 shows visual layout measurements for radio button controls in a group box. Notice that the controls align with the checkbox title of the group box.

In positioning a secondary group box inside of a primary group box, you should treat the secondary group box as a dialog item with regard to spacing. So for nested group boxes, you measure the space between the outside edge of  
<span id="page-80-0"></span>the secondary group box and the inside border line of the primary group box. Figure 3-28 shows a nested group box that leaves 10 pixels of space between the inside border line of the bottom edge of the primary group box and the outside bottom edge of the nested, secondary group box.

[Figure 3-29](#page-81-0) summarizes the dimensions for laying out group boxes. The list following the figure describes application of these dimensions.

Here is how to use these measurements:  
- Side margins inside, allow 10 pixels.
- Top margin inside, allow 12 pixels.
- Bottom margin inside, allow 10 pixels.
- Horizontal distance between a group box and other groups of controls or group boxes, allow 10 pixels.
- Vertical distance between a group box and other control groups or group boxes, allow 12 pixels.
