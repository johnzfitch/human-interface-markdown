Hearing problems are generally no obstacle to using computers, except when important cues are given only with sound. Except for the obvious exceptions of music or voice-systhesis applications, software should never rely solely on sound to provide important information. Supplement all audible messages with visual cues, or allow the user to choose visible instead of audible messages.
