Some applications that represent objects or well known products, such as Calculator and QuickTime Player, are most easilyrecognized bythe symbols or objects themselves. When creatingicons for such applications, it's more aesthetically pleasing to create a simplified, idealized representation of the object or symbol, instead of using an actual screen shot of the software. Re-creating the object is particularly important when users could confuse the icon with the actual interface.

<span id="page-141-1"></span>These icons, many of which are a precursor of what you'll see when you open the application, use a straight-on perspective (rather than the "on a desktop" user application style). You never see the Calculator onscreen in three dimensions, for example, so its icon doesn't depict it that way.
