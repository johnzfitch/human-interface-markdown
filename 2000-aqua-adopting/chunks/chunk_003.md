Sheets are a new way to present certain dialogs to the user. Sheets are "attached" to a particular document or window; they are displayed as an animation that appears to emerge from the window's title bar. This attachment ensures that the user never loses track of the association of a sheet with its pertinent window, even when other windows are opened and closed. The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window enables users to take full advantage of Mac OS X's window layering model. [Figure 1-1](#page-4-0) shows an example of a sheet presenting a modal dialog.
