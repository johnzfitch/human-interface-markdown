- Did you use graphics to illustrate commands, features, and parameters of the applications, as well as all of the user's data, whenever possible?
- Do the graphics resemble items that users are familiar with? Did you leave out insignificant detail (which unnecessarily complicates a graphic)?
- Does the screen look "clean" and free from clutter?
- Does the user have control over the design of the workplace, allowing him or her to individualize it?
- Is the information in windows organized so that the most important information can be read first?
- Does your design look good at different bit depths on all Macintosh computers?
- Do you use a consistent light source, one that always comes from the upper-left corner of the screen?
- Do you use white space and graphics to break up long pieces of text?
