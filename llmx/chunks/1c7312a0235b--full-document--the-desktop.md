# The desktop

The primary unifying metaphor in the Apple Desktop Interface is the desktop itself, shown in Figure 3-1. It provides a sense of apparent stability, remaining constant while its content changes.

Desktop icons are graphic representations of such things as disks, folders, applications, documents, stationery, and the trash can, as shown in Figure 3-2.

Figure 3-2 Six kinds of Finder icons

Applications are the programs with which users do their work or play—from word processors to music composers to spreadsheets. **Documents** are the user's data files—the place where all the work done in an application is stored. **Stationery** files are templates that can contain anything a regular document can contain: a memo or overhead template, or only page setup or layout information. **Folders** let the user organize the desktop; they can contain applications, documents, stationery templates, other folders, or any other sort of file. All of these objects can be stored on **disks**, and can be erased by dragging their icons to the **Trash** on the screen.

Icons contribute greatly to the clarity and attractiveness of an application. The use of icons in addition to (or instead of) words can also make it easier to translate programs into other languages, except where the icons have different meanings in different cultures. An item is easier to remember when it's represented by an icon with text than if it's represented by either an icon alone or text alone. Wherever an explanation or label is needed, consider using an icon.

The two basic subsystems of the desktop are the **windows** that allow flexible display of information, and the **menus** (including palettes) that make many operations immediately available.
