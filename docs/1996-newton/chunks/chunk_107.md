The Info picker pops up from the standard Info button at the left end of the status bar and gives users access to preference settings for the application, general information about the application, or on-screen help for the application. The Info picker contain any of these general-information items: About, Help, and Prefs. The Info picker may also contain additional items unique to the application. Figure 4-17 shows several example Info pickers.

If you do not have all three general-information items—About, Help and Prefs—keep the ordering listed, but leave out the unused items. List any application-specific items below a separator line. If your application does not have any unique items in its Info picker, or if it has only unique items (not About, Help, or Prefs), then do not include the separator line. Any unique items you include in the Info picker should specify a state or initiate an action that affects the whole application.  
An About box should include your application's name, version number, and copyright information. You can include additional information in the About box if you wish, such as a logo, credits, and acknowledgments. Include a Close box so users can put the About box away after reading it. Use a conventional matte border.
