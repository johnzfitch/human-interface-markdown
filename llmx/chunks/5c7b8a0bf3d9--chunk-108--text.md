#### Text  
For legibility, some non-Roman characters need higher resolution than Roman characters. On the Japanese Macintosh Plus, for example, the system font must be larger than normal—it must allow for l6-by-l6 pixel characters. The Macintosh Plus ROM sets the system font size and family according to low-memory variables. For example, it is possible to specify text in dialog boxes and menu bars to 14-point New York. Applications should not change the system font or font size: let the user (or the system, where that is possible) make such changes. Applications can use SysFontSize to get the default font size to use for their text.
