These menus should remain similar to their Mac OS 9 counterparts, with the exceptions of the relocated Preferences and Quit items described in ["The](#page-32-1)  [Application Menu" \(page 33\)](#page-32-1). If an application is not document-centered, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate. For example, the System Preferences application's second menu is called Panes. If there are no relevant commands in the File menu, you can eliminate it altogether. For example, if your single-window application automatically quits when its window is closed, you do not have to provide a Close Window command; the Quit command in the application menu is sufficient.
