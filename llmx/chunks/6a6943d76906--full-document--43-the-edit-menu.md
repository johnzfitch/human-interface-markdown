# 43. THE EDIT MENU

One menu almost always available in the menu bar is the edit menu. It contains the basic editing commands Cut, Paste and Copy, and the general command Undo. It may also contain Bold, Italic, Underline, and Normal. Each of these commands may be invoked in the normal way with the mouse, or from the keyboard via their apple key shortcuts.
