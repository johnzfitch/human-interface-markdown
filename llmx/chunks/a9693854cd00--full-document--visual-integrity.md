### Visual Integrity

In traditional programming, the visual appearance of the screen is somewhat arbitrary, and often a relatively low priority. In contrast, applications using the Apple Desktop Interface require a very high precision in visual layout and the definition of elements. It is the screen display that carries most of the information in this interface.

Programmers have excellent tools to meet this requirement—including fonts, graphic display routines, and tools such as pull—down menus, scroll bars, and so on—but substantial visual planning is still required. Distinguish different objects visually on the screen. Consider the customizing the user may do. And be sure each display makes sense as a whole.
