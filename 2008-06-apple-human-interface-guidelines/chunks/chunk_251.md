Because a bottom bar is part of the window frame, it has the same gray gradient surface that is visible in the toolbar–title bar area.  
Bottom bars can contain either regular-size or small rectangular-style toolbar controls; bottom bars should not contain icon buttons, capsule-style toolbar controls, custom controls, or any standard Aqua controls. See ["Rectangular-Style](#page-249-0) Toolbar Controls" (page 250) for more information about controls that are suitable for use in a bottom bar.  
**Important:** If you choose to use system-provided images in your bottom-bar controls, be sure to avoid redefining their meanings. For example, use the Quick Look symbol to mean "preview with Quick Look" only; don't use it to mean "magnify."  
At the top of Figure 14-26 you can see the Address Book bottom bar (which uses small controls) and below it you can see the iCal bottom bar (which uses regular-size controls).
