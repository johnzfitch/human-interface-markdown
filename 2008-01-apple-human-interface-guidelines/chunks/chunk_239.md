In addition to printing, the minimal Print dialog lets users choose a printer and printer settings, save, mail, or fax a document in the PDF or PostScript formats, and preview a document before printing. The expanded Print dialog adds printing-specific settings, such as number of copies, page range, paper settings, and layout.  
#### <span id="page-255-4"></span>Print Dialog  
In the Print dialog, user options are provided via the features pop-up menu, which displays panes drawn and controlled by printing dialog extensions (PDEs). PDEs are provided by the operating system, printer modules, and applications. Apple provides a number of printing panes. The standard Print dialog is shown in Figure 14-63.

Options for choosing paper type and print quality are displayed through the features pop-up menu. The ability to save the document in PDF or PostScript format, fax the document, or save it to iPhoto or other applications is available in the PDF pop-down menu in the lower left. You can create custom print panes by following the interface guidelines provided throughout this document and the layout guidelines described in "Positioning [Regular-Size](#page-350-1) Controls" (page 351). Here are some specific guidelines to keep in mind if you implement custom printing features:  
- Choose a menu item name that doesn't conflict with menu items already in the features pop-up menu.
- The menu item (the pane name) should help users easily determine the options the pane contains.
- Make sure the features you implement are appropriate for your application. For example, an option to print in reverse order should be provided by the operating system, not by your application. (Implementing this feature requires the application to know the hardware's capabilities.)
- Make interdependencies amongoptions clearto users.For example, if a user selects double-sided printing, the option to print on transparencies should become unavailable.
- Separate more advanced features from frequently used features. When the user chooses to display the advanced features, there should be an "advanced options" title above the advanced controls.
- <span id="page-256-1"></span>■ Provide visual feedback (such as the preview in the Layout pane of the Print dialog) when appropriate. A thumbnail showing the effect of changing a tone control, for example, helps users determine desired settings.
- <span id="page-256-3"></span><span id="page-256-2"></span>■ Save a user's printing preferences for a document, at least while the document is open. Provide a way for users to save custom settings.  
#### Page Setup Dialog  
The Page Setup dialog provides a way for users to set the scaling and orientation options for a document based on the intended output paper size and the printer. Save the settings in this dialog with the document. Figure 14-64 shows an example of a page setup dialog.

<span id="page-258-2"></span><span id="page-258-1"></span><span id="page-258-0"></span>**Controls** are graphic objects that cause instant actions or visible results when users manipulate them with the mouse or other input device. Standard controls include push buttons, scroll bars, radio buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and pop-up menus.  
This chapter discusses the behavior and appearance of controls available in Mac OS X. It also provides usage recommendations for each control so you can use them correctly in your application. When appropriate, this chapter also offers control dimensions, labeling guidelines, and recommended spacing metrics to help you lay out controls in your window (for more extensive window-layout guidelines, see "Layout [Guidelines"](#page-350-0) (page 351)). Note that, in most cases, one dimension of a control (typically the height) is fixed and should not be changed. When this is the case, the description of the control may include the pixel measurement of the fixed dimension, but only to help you lay out your window, not because you need to use this measurement to create the control.  
You are strongly encouraged to use standard, system-provided controls in your application. When you do this, you benefit in two important ways. First, these controls are automatically updated whenever the Mac OS X user interface is refreshed, which means that you don't have to produce a new version of your application to take advantage of the new look. Second, the appropriate use of familiar controls allows users to predict how to operate your application and therefore spend more time discovering what it does.  
In addition, you should strive to use only the standard control sizes, which are regular, small, and mini. Most applications look best with regular-size controls, although small and mini controls can work well when space is very limited, such as in a panel. In particular, take care to avoid vertically resizing controls. In Mac OS X v10.5 and later, vertically resizing a control can cause it to produce an undesirable look that does not harmonize with the window appearance.  
**Important:** Every control described in this chapter is accompanied by at least one illustration that shows an example of the control. These illustrations show the appearance of the control, usually demonstrate a recommended usage, and sometimes show spacing metrics. However, the images of the controls themselves do not necessarily exhibit the precise measurements or colors you would observe in a running application. Therefore, you should never measure the images in this document and use those measurements to create controls or other user-interface elements. Note that when you use Interface Builder to create your user interface, you automatically get the proper control sizes.
