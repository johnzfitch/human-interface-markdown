**Control sizes**: The dimensions of the radio button itself are fixed for each size, but you determine the length of the label that introduces the group and the length of each radio button label.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: Radio button text (both the introductory label and control label) should be in a font that is proportional to the size of the control. The following fonts are supplied automatically by Interface Builder:  
- Regular size: System font.
- Small: Small system font.
- Mini: Mini system font.  
Use the following metrics to position the introductory labels correctly:  
- Regular size: 8 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.
- <span id="page-273-1"></span>■ Small: 6 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.
- Mini: 5 pixels from the end of the label (the colon) to the control.  
**Control spacing**: Radio buttons can be arranged vertically or horizontally, depending on the overall layout of your window or dialog. Typically, however, radio buttons are stacked vertically to emphasize the mutually exclusive relationship among the buttons.  
If you position a group of radio buttons horizontally, measure the space needed to accommodate the longest radio button label. Use that measurement to make the space between each pair of radio buttons consistent.  
Use the following metrics when you position radio buttons vertically:  
- Regular size: 6 pixels between controls.
- Small: 6 pixels between controls.
- <span id="page-273-0"></span>■ Mini: 5 pixels between controls.  
For radio buttons stacked vertically or horizontally, be sure to align the baseline of the introductory label with the baseline of the first button's label, as shown in Figure 15-22.
