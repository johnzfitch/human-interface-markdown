Although each application has its own way of initially placing windows on the screen, the user can move an active window—to make more room on the desktop or to uncover a window it's overlapping—simply by dragging it by its title bar. A dotted outline of the window follows the pointer until the user releases the mouse button. At the release of the button the full window is redrawn in its new location. Moving a window doesn't affect the appearance of the document within the window; the document moves right along with the window.  
The act of moving an inactive window makes it active—unless the user holds down the Apple key while moving the inactive window, in which case the window moves, in the same plane, without becoming active.  
The application should ensure that a window can never be moved completely off the screen.
