When virtual objects and actionsin an app are metaphorsfor familiar experiences—whether these experiences are rooted in the real world or the digital world—users quickly grasp how to use the app.  
It's best when an app uses a metaphor to suggest a usage or experience without letting the metaphor enforce the limitations of the object or action on which it's based.  
iOS apps have great scope for metaphors because people physically interact with the screen. Metaphors in iOS include:  
● Moving layered views to expose content beneath them  
- Dragging, flicking, or swiping objects in a game
- Tapping switches, sliding sliders, and spinning pickers
- Flicking through pages of a book or magazine
