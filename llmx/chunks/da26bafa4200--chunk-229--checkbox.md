#### Checkbox  
A checkbox is a standard Macintosh control that displays a setting, either checked (on) or unchecked (off); it appears as a square with label text next to it. The user *clicks* a checkbox, not *checks* a checkbox, to select or deselect the corresponding option. When the option is on, an *x* appears in the box. When the option is off, the box is empty.
