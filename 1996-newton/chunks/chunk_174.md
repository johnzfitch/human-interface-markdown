Every application should schedule and use alarms in a way that does not hamper the activities of other applications on the same Newton. Storage is one concern, since each alarm uses internal storage space. You don't have to limit your application to one alarm, but scheduling a daily wake-up alarm for the next year by creating 365 different alarms would use up an excessive amount of internal storage. Exercise reasonable judgment when creating multiple alarms.  
Actions taken besides displaying a notification alert should be brief. If your alarm initiates a time-consuming process, it may delay the execution of other alarms set to go off at approximately the same time.  
Note that your application may not be open when its alarm executes. In fact, your application may not even be installed. If your application's alarms aren't useful when it isn't installed, it should remove them when a user removes it (for example by removing the card it's on). There is no point in wasting space with useless alarms that display notification messages such as "Sorry, this alarm can't execute because the application isn't installed."
