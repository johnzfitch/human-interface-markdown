#### **Programming Note: Implementing Commands**  
Many menu commands are standard, as described in this section, "Standard Menus and Commands." Many of these standard commands and much of their behavior are supplied by the Application Kit, Project Builder, and Interface Builder. The Application Kit even automatically changes the names of some commands, such as changing Bold to Unbold, and disables some commands when they're invalid, such as Heavier. (Both commands are in the Font menu, which is described later in this chapter.) However, you should double-check that each menu command works correctly.  
The title of the main menu should be the name of the application, shortened somehow if the name is too long. For example, the main menu of Interface Builder is named IB because naming it Interface Builder would needlessly waste screen space.  
| Command  | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Info     | Attaches the Info menu, which contains commands that give general<br>information about the application, as well as let the user set general<br>preferences about how the application works. Info is the first command<br>in the main menu in part because it can be read in conjunction with the<br>application name in the title bar (for example, Info about Edit, Info about<br>Draw, and so on). See "The Info Menu," later in this chapter. |
| Document | Attaches the Document menu, which has commands that affect a<br>document as a whole-opening, saving, and closing, for example. This<br>menu is named differently in different applications, so it's important that<br>the command be in a prominent, well-defined location (second). See<br>"The Document Menu," later in this chapter.                                                                                                          |
| Edit     | Attaches the Edit menu, which contains commands affecting the current<br>selection. Every application that can have editable documents or<br>selectable text must have this menu. See "The Edit Menu," later in<br>this chapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Format   | Attaches the Format menu, which contains commands affecting the<br>layout of documents, including the font and paragraph format of text and<br>the arrangement of graphic images. See "The Format Menu," later in<br>this chapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Command  | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Windows  | Attaches the Windows menu, which contains commands affecting the<br>windows that belong to the application. See "The Windows Menu," later<br>in this chapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Print    | Brings up the Print panel, which permits the user to print or fax a<br>. document. You can omit the Print command if your application doesn't<br>print. In general, the Print command is assumed to print the document<br>in the main window. If a panel can be printed (for example, one that<br>contains a registration form), then to avoid confusion the panel might<br>contain its own Print button. |
| Services | Attaches the Services menu. This menu lets the user choose services<br>provided by the system or by other applications. See "The Services<br>. Menu," later in this chapter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Hide     | Hides all the windows of the application. See "Hiding and Retrieving<br>Windows" in Chapter 4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Quit     | Terminates the application. If quitting the application might cause<br>the user to lose work, then the application should bring up a Quit<br>panel. Otherwise, the application should not require confirmation of<br>a Quit command.                                                                                                                                                                      |  
The Info, Services, Hide, and Quit commands should be in the main menu of every application. The other commands described above should be included when appropriate.
