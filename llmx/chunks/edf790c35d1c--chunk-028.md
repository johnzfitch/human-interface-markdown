The mouse is a small device the size of a deck of playing cards, connected to the computer by a long, flexible cable. There's a button on the top of the mouse. The user holds the mouse and rolls it on a flat, smooth surface. A pointer on the screen follows the motion of the mouse.  
The mouse is reserved for windowing and entertainment applications only.  
It should not be installed into a menu program for purposes of advertising "mouseability".  
A complete description of the actions and activities of the mouse may be found the description of the mouse within the Mouse Guidelines section.
