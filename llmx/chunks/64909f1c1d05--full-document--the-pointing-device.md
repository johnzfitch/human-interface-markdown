# The Pointing Device

The pointing device makes possible the direct manipulation that is a central part of the desktop interface. To communicate with the computer, the user manipulates graphical objects on the screen. This manipulation is direct because the user can grab (or seem to

grab) an object, then indicate what is to be done with it. How do you "grab" an object that yu see only as a two-dimensional representation on a glass screen? By pointing at it with a pointing device.

The standard pointing device is the mouse, but there are other devices (track balls, for example) that perform the same functions. The mouse is a hand-held device, usually (but not necessarily) connected to the computer by a long, flexible cable. There's a single button on the mouse. The user holds the mouse and rolls it on a flat, smooth surface. A pointer on the screen follows the motion of the mouse. A pointer is a screen object that moves in response to mouse movements. Pointers can take different shapes according to the context of the application. Two of the most common pointer shapes are crosshairs and arrows.

Simply moving the mouse (without pressing the mouse button) just moves the pointer. Most actions take place only when the user positions the pointer over an object on the screen, then presses and releases the mouse button.
