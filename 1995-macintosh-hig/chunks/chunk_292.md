It's best to provide separate balloons for selected, unselected, and unavailable radio buttons. For selected radio buttons, describe what the button does, beginning with a verb. At the end of the balloon, say that the button is selected. Figure 11-12 shows an example of this.

For an unselected radio button, describe what happens when you select the button. For example, you could say, "To align the objects at the left margin of the document, click this button." For a button that's not available, describe what the button does when selected using a sentence fragment beginning with a verb. Then explain why it is not available. For example, a balloon might say, "Aligns objects at the left margin of the document. Not available because no objects are selected."  
#### Checkboxes 11  
For checkboxes, you need to provide several pieces of information. Describe the current state of the system (what the system does currently, given whether the option is selected or not), an explanation of the option provided by the checkbox, and how to turn it on or off. Don't describe the current state of the system if it's obvious or if it would involve saying merely, "This option is *not* on." Also, don't include an explanation of the option if your users don't need one.

Note that the help balloon shown in Figure 11-13 tells the user about the current state of the system by the way it phrases the sentence: "To turn on text smoothing, click this box." (This means that text smoothing is *not* currently being used.) If the sentence were phrased like this: "To turn *off* text smoothing, click this box," it would tell us the opposite information about the current state of the system (that text smoothing *is* currently being used).  
For unavailable checkboxes, describe what the box does when it's selected and then explain why it is not available. This case is similar to that of an unavailable radio button.  
#### Groups of Checkboxes or Radio Buttons 11  
You can provide a single balloon for an entire group of radio buttons, or for a group of closely related checkboxes. When providing one balloon for a group of options, describe what you can do with the options, how to implement the options, and how you can tell whether an option is selected.

#### Tools in Palettes 11  
It's a good idea to name tools in palettes, because the name can help the user figure out what the tool is for. After naming the tool, describe one or two likely ways to use it. Don't describe every shortcut or trick you can do with the modifier keys. Figure 11-15 shows one example of a help balloon for a tool in a palette.

Apple provides standard balloons for standard window parts. If your windows have nonstandard parts, use the general guidelines for writing balloons to describe them. Name only the parts of the window that it's necessary for the user to know.
