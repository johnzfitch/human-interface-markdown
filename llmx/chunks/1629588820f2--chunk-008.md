A few years ago, an engineer at Apple described the ideal interface as being "familiar and intuitive". During the preparation of this book, we asked the same engineer again, and he stated that while it was important for an interface to be familiar, it was no longer necessary for it to be intuitive. It turned out there was a good reason for this: computer scientists don't know what "intuitive" means, so we don't know how to deal with it.  
Intuition is real, it has been researched, it has been defined. It is a powerful mental capability of both the designer and the user, and as such deserves practical understanding.  
The Nature of Intuition  
Stated perhaps over-simply, intuition is the ability to discern

the right hand, was nevertheless growing close to a solution when the right hand unexpectedly came over and, rather than helping out, scattered the pieces of the puzzle all over the table. This agressive act was witnessed repeatedly with other split-brain patients.  
There was a war for supremacy going on in these people's heads, a war that seemed to reach a truce several months after the operation, with the left, logic-oriented lobe achieving dominance. When one couples this strange phenomenon with the empiricle evidence of Western society's bias against left-handedness, one begins to understand why we know so little about this profoundly powerful skill—our logical, concious mind doesn't want to know.  
So what is intuition, what is it good for, and how do we use it? Intuition deals with patterns: pictures, chains of events, clustering of seemingly irrelevant information. Intuition is a non-verbal skill, and words cannot effectively describe it. We have to get to it through metaphor, example, and shared experience.  
Intuition operates in leaps: it churns away with no concious thought and little concious control and then suddenly springs forth with what is often described as an "Aha!" experience. An example of this takes place when you learn a new board game: you keep hearing and attempting to memorize the rules of the game and suggested strategies, but it is all very compartmentalized and difficult to keep ahold of. Then, all at once, you "get it": the entire underlying strategy and purpose of the game is instantly and permanently obvious.  
Those of you who are programmers have undoubtedly experienced working until 2:00 in the morning on a seemingly insoluable bug problem, finally giving up, and going home to sleep. Then, at 6:30 AM, you wake up knowing exactly what is wrong and kick yourself for not realizing it earlier—after all, it is perfectly obvious.  
Reaching a useful conclusion through intuition is a three-stage process:  
1. Gathering information 2. Allowing time for "incubation" 3. Judging the results  
We recognize two kinds of intuition. The first is "women's intuition," a remarkable ability to understand human relationships and interactions. Men also use intuition, but they call it "hunches". While these two kinds of intuition are different, they arn't as gender-specific as our culture has declared them; in Eastern culture both men and women develop powerful abilities to "look through" people.  
l. Gathering information. This data may be new sensory information, coupled with old memories. Because intuition works on drawing together what is often logically unrelatable data, you should make a concious effort to be non-judgemental during this stage. Take in everything.  
Intuition is an ancient skill, both in evolution and personal development. Dogs are no intellectual giants when compared to man, but  
information. They might be temporary help, or they might be people who normally performed a different job. Their needs were for an quick to learn, easy to use interface.  
- 2. The decision-makers. These people would be expected to draw information from the system, both by calling up data on the display and generating reports. They could be expected to be habitual users of the system: they could handle a long but gentle learning-curve that would give them progressively more power.
- 3. The Key Operator. These people are the ones who, in real life, read the manuals. They can be expected to spend some time with the system initially and can be expected to learn how to perform the more technical operation and maintenance tasks of the system.  
Once the users of the system were identified, once their individual needs were identified, the designers were able to "unbalance" their equally-difficult interface, so that each user had a level of difficulty consistent with their abilities and the amount of time they could spend learning the system.  
A smiling, complaining administrative assistant is a rather obscure hint to a program design problem, but it is typical of the way the intuitive mind communicates its results. Keep in mind that the poor, "primitive" intuition is quite incapable of speech and logic. On the other hand, it knew the answer to the problem four days before the logical mind. The finest intuitive leaps are utterly useless if you fail to listen: learn to relax when things look the darkest; you may already know the answer.  
The Jungian judgement skills are Logic and Feeling. Of the eight Jungian classifiers (of which four have been presented here), only one has shown any gender bias: approximately 60% of men depend primarily on logical conclusions, while 60% of women depend primarily on ethical considerations. (This explains a lot of insoluable domestic arguments.) So-called "women's intuition" is intuition with Feeling judgement, while traditional men's hunches are intuition with Logic judgement.  
Intuition and the Programmer  
Programmers and designers can make use of intuition on design and debugging problems (linked with Logic) and during user-testing (linked with Feeling). Programmers in a recent test were found to depend on Intuition as the primary perception skill twice as much as the general population. By following the above steps, you can increase the power and effectiveness of your own skill.  
In the section on Testing, we will discuss how intuition can be used to detect problem areas of programs during user-testing, with a method far less expensive and more effective than computer-analysis of elaborate questionaires.  
Intuition and the User  
get to a part of a tutorial that tells you to just press Open-Apple-P to print out your document, but fails to mention that you should have already spent two hours configuring the ports, that's frustration. It happens because the designer, programmer, and documentor have become so familiar with the programmer that they have forgotten their own learning problems. It is always overcomable with user-testing.  
Trust is a most fragile commodity. For a user to trust your program, you must be consistent and absolutely honest. The program with the right answer 99 times out of 100 is useless. The program which uses Open-Apple-E for Edit under all circumstances except that one undocumented one where it stands for Eradicate All Files will never be trusted again. If you say a document has been loaded, then the document should have been loaded. Your user will find you less than honest if he or she then removes the disk, only to be told that your program can't seem to find the document. You should try to make your program as safe an environment as possible (without frustrating the constant user), and you should partition off and clearly mark those operations that are of danger.  
Next to a competent design, the most important attribute a program can display is a caring, polite, respectful attitude. The Apple II computer has a definite personality, as embodied in the tutorial disks and manuals supplied with the computer. Use these materials until you have grasped (intuitively) their flavor, and follow their lead. It is what your user feels comfortable with.
