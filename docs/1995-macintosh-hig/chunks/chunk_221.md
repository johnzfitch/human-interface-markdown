The pointer should always be visible. When it's being used for selecting and choosing, it should remain black. A color pointer might not be visible over different colored backgrounds and doesn't give the user any extra information. However, when the user is drawing or typing in color, the drawing or text-insertion pointer can appear in the color that is being used. Except for multicolored paintbrush pointers, the pointer shouldn't contain more than one color at once since it's hard for the eye to distinguish small areas of color. Whether the point is black or colored, make sure the point can be seen when it's placed on a background of a similar color. This can be accomplished by changing the color of the pointer (to contrast it with the background) or by outlining the pointer with a contrasting color (one pixel wide).
