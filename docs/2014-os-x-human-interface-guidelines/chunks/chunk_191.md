Because a freestanding toolbar icon doesn't need to fit within a toolbar control, you have a little more room to express a concept. In general, you want to create an inviting image that clearly communicates its purpose to users.  
Although you use the straight-on perspective for the freestanding toolbar icons you design, if you use a recognizable icon from elsewhere in the interface in your toolbar, don't change its appearance or perspective. That is, don't redesign a toolbar version of a well-known interface element.  
If you need to design a freestanding icon for your toolbar, follow these guidelines:  
- Use a straight-on perspective.
- Make the outline sharp and clear.
- Use anti-aliasing.
- Use color judiciously to add meaning.
- Create icons for standard and high-resolution displays. You need to supply two resources: 32x32 (32 x 32 pixel canvas size) and 32x32@2x (64 x 64 pixel canvas size).
- Use the PNG format.
