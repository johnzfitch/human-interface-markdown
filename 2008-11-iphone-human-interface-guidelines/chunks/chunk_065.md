A **text field** is a rounded rectangular field that accepts user input. When the user taps a text field a keyboard appears; when the user taps Return in the keyboard, the text field handlesthe input in an application-specific way. A text field can contain a single line of input. Figure 9-14 shows two text fields in the Maps application.

You can customize a text field to help users understand how they should use it in your application. For example, you can display custom images in the left or right sides of the text field, or a system-provided button, such as the Bookmarks button shown in Figure 9-14. In general, you should use the left end of a text field to indicate its purpose and the right end to indicate the presence of additional features, such as bookmarks.  
You can also cause the Clear button to appear in the right end of a text field. When this element is present, tapping it clears the contents of the text field, regardless of any other image you might display over it.  
Sometimes, it helps users understand the purpose of a text field if it displays a hint, such as "Name." A text field supports the display of such placeholder text, which can appear when there is no other text in the field.
