The most powerful, successful, and compelling way to use speech technology is to engage users in spoken dialogues. Spoken dialogues are multi-turn conversational interactions in which the computer asks a question, the user speaks an answer, the computer asks another question, and so on. When the computer asks a question, the user automatically knows how to answer, and the speech engine has a better chance of recognizing what was said. For example:  
*User:* Schedule a meeting.  
*Computer:* What day would you like to meet?  
*User:* Friday.  
*Computer:* What time?  
*User:* 6 P.M.  
*Computer:* Whom do you want to invite?  
*User:* Tom, Jerome, Devang, Kevin, Matthias, and Kim.  
*Computer:* OK. Scheduling a meeting on Friday at 6 P.M. with Tom, Jerome,  
<span id="page-259-1"></span>Devang, Kevin, Matthias, and Kim.  
With spoken dialogues of this form, it's possible to provide users with a means of delegating a goal to the computer (scheduling a meeting, in the previous example), rather than performing a sequence of steps that each involves the keyboard and mouse. The computer can ask the user for any extra information it needs to reach that goal. Speech is an ideal way to delegate a goal to an intelligent assistant.
