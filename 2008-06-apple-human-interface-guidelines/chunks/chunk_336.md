<span id="page-270-2"></span>Bevel buttons are available in Interface Builder. To create one using Application Kit programming interfaces, use the setBezelStyle: method of NSButtonCell with NSRegularSquareBezelStyle asthe argument. To create a square-cornered bevel button, use NSShadowlessSquareBezelStyle as the argument for the setBezelStyle: method.  
You can also use Interface Builder to add a pop-up menu to a bevel button. First, drag a pop-up button into your window then, in the Attributes pane of the inspector, change the type to Pull Down. Finally, in the same pane, change the style to Bevel (for a standard bevel button look) or Square (for a square-cornered bevel button look).
