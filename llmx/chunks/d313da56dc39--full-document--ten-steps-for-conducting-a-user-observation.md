#### Ten Steps for Conducting a User Observation

The following steps provide guidelines that you can use when conducting a simple user observation. Remember, this test is not designed as an experiment, so you will not get quantitative data that can be statistically analyzed. You can, however, see where people have difficulty using your product, and you can then use that information to improve your product.

Most of these steps include some explanatory text that contains sample statements that you can read to the participant. Feel free to modify the statements to suit your product and the situation.
