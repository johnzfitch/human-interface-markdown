Alert boxes are a special case of modal dialog boxes. **Alert boxes** display messages to users to inform them of situations that run from interesting to dangerous. Each type of alert has a corresponding icon that appears in the alert box as described in the sections that follow. An alert box contains only an icon, text, and buttons. There are no other controls in alert boxes.
