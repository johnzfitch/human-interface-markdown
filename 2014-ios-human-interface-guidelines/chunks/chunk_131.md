**API Note:** To learn more about defining a switch in your code, see "Switches".  
#### A switch:  
- Indicates the binary state of an item
- Is used in table views only  
Use a switch in a table row to give users a way to specify one of two options, such as yes/no or on/off, that govern the state of an item.  
You can use a switch control to change the state of other UI elements in the view. Depending on the choice users make, new list items might appear or disappear, or list items might become active or inactive.
