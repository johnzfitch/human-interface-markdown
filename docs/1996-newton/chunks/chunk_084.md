Space permitting, you can include an **Analog Clock button** at the left end of your application's status bar. The clock continuously displays the time of day. If a user taps the clock, a small panel bearing a digital clock and battery gauge slides out. The panel goes away automatically after three seconds unless the user taps it sooner. Figure 3-22 shows how the Analog Clock button works.
