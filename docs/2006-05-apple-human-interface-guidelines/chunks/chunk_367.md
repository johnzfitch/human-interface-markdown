A changeable pane dialog, like the one shown in Figure 15-5, follows the same general guidelines as those outlined in "A Simple [Preferences](#page-288-2) Dialog" (page 289). However, it illustrates another implementation of many of the same basic guidelines you've seen so far, along with some new guidelines.

Center-equalization is again evident in Figure 15-6. The overall effect of the window is a balance between the visual weight of the controls on one side of the invisible center axis with the weight of the controls on the other side. The controls are also collectively balanced within the group box so that the distance from the farthest control on each side of the group box is the same for both the right and left sides (41 pixels in this example).  
Always center a tab view within a window.

Figure 15-7 illustrates a few guidelines about control placement:  
- The colons for stacked labels are right-aligned.
- Stacked controls are left-aligned when appropriate.
- Similar controls have consistent widths. For example, the Font pop-up menus and Size combo boxes are the same size in the two group boxes.  
Right-align labels and label colons Left-align stacked items

Figure 15-8 illustrates the following spacing guidelines:  
- Leave 12 pixels of space from the top of a tab to the bottom of the title bar.
- The text box around any label should be at least 2 pixels below the controls of any containing view.  
Control widths consistent Control widths consistent  
- Within group boxes, leave at least a 16-pixel margin between controls and the edge of the group box. In this example, an 18-pixel borderis used on one of thegroup boxes since it visuallybalances the window better than the minimum 16-pixel border.
- There should be a 20 pixel margin all the left side, right side, and bottom of a dialog.
