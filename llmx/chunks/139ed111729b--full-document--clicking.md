#### Clicking

Clicking has two components: pushing down on the mouse button and then quickly releasing it while the mouse remains stationary. (If the mouse moves between button down and button up, dragging—not just clicking—is what happens.) Some uses of clicking are to select an object, to move an insertion point, and to turn on a control. The effect of clicking should be immediate and evident. If the function of the click is to cause an action (as when clicking on a button), the *selection is made* when the button is pressed, and the *action takes place* when the button is released.
