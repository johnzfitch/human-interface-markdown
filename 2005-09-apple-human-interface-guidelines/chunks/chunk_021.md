Once you have a prototype, let some target users try it out and observe their reactions to it. Watch and listen carefully to these users, and try to videotape their reactions as they work through specific tasks you've defined for your prototype. User observations can help you determine how well your designworks orwhere there are problems. If product designers and engineers are available, encourage them towatch the tests, but prevent them from interactingwith the users so that they do not influence the test results.  
During user testing, be sure to limit the scope of your tests to key areas of your product. Focus on the tasks you identified during your task analysis. Your instructions to the participants should be clear and complete but should not explain how to do things you're trying to test.  
Use the information recorded from your user tests to analyze your design and use that information to reviseyour prototype. When you have a second prototype, conduct a second set of user observations to test the workability of your design changes. You can repeat this process as often as you like until you feel confident thatyou've addressed the needs ofyourtarget audience and created a highly usable product that displays the characteristics of great software (see ["Characteristics](#page-46-0) of Great [Software"](#page-46-0) (page 47)).
