# Physical Disabilities

Many people can use keyboards only with mouthsticks or similar devices. They can press only one key at a time. They need software that allows them to press the modifier key first, then the character key, rather than requiring that both are pressed simultaneously. The modified state is in effect for just the one keypress, then reverts to the unmodified state. Hitting the modifier key twice causes the computer to lock in the modified state; a third press of the modifier key unlocks the modification. (If software does require that two or three keys be pressed at once, at least choose the keys such that a person can do it with one hand.)
