<span id="page-216-5"></span><span id="page-216-4"></span><span id="page-216-3"></span>When an item is dragged from an application or a Finder window to the desktop, the Finder creates a clipping that contains the data in the dragged item. If discontinuous selections are dragged from a source to the Finder, a separate clipping is created for each selected item.  
Your application should provide a number of representations (such as TEXT, PICT, and native formats) to ensure flexibility with different subsequent destinations. Regardless of which representations are stored, round-trip data integrity should be preserved; a clipping dragged back into its source should be identical to the original item.  
When clippings are created, each clipping is given a default name, which is a concatenation of the type of data that was dragged and the word "clipping" (plus a number, if necessary, to avoid naming conflicts). For example, dragging some text from a document to the Finder would generate a file named "text clipping." If the type is unknown, it is omitted from the clipping name.
