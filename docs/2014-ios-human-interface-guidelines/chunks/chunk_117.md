A **Contact Add button** lets the user add an existing contact to a text field or other text-based view.

**API Note:** To learn how to define a Contact Add button in your code, see "Buttons".  
#### A Contact Add button:  
- Displays a list of the user's contacts
- Helps users add a contact to the view that contains the Contact Add button  
Use a Contact Add button to give users an easy way to access a contact without using the keyboard. For example, users can tap the Contact Add button in the To field of the Mail compose view instead of typing a recipient's name.  
<span id="page-182-1"></span>Because the Contact Add button functions as an alternative to typing contact information, it's not appropriate to use the button in a view that doesn't accept keyboard input.
