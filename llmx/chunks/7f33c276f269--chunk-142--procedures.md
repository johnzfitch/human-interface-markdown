#### Procedures  
Planning and carrying out a true experimental test takes time and expert training. But many of the questions you may have about your design do not require such a rigid approach. Furthermore, the computer and application already provide a controlled setting from which objective data can be gathered quite reliably. The major requirements are:  
- to make objective observations
- to record the data during the user-product interaction  
Objective observations include measures of time, frequencies, error rates, and so forth. The simple and direct recording of what the person does and says while working is also an objective observation, however, and is often very useful to designers. Test subjects can be encouraged to talk as they work, telling what they are doing, trying to do, expect to happen, etc. This record of a person's "thinking aloud" is called a protocol by researchers in the fields of cognition and problem-solving, and is a major source of their data.  
The process of testing described here involves the application designer and the test subjects in a regular cycle of feedback and revision. Although the test procedures themselves may be informal, user-testing of the concepts and features of the interface becomes a regular, integral part of the design process.
