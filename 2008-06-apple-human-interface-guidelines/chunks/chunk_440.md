List views can contain disclosure triangles to reveal a list hierarchy, but only in one column. Column headers should be nouns orshort noun phrasesthat describe an attribute of the data. Figure 15-80 shows an example of the Finder list view that includes disclosure triangles to reveal additional levels of hierarchy and short, clear column headers.

List views can contain icons in addition to text. Usually, however, the icons in a list view are an integral part of the data items (such as the folder and document icons in Figure 15-80). In general, it's best to include an attributes column and use text to describe the attributes.
