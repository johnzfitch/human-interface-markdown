A **drawer** is a child window that slides out from a parent window and that the user can open or close (show or hide) while the parent window is open. Drawers are rarely used in modern Mac apps. As much as possible, redesign your UI to avoid using drawers; if you're creating a new app, avoid adding a drawer to the design.  
Typically, a drawer contains frequently accessed controls that don't need to be visible at all times. For example, the Keynote Build inspector uses a drawer to provide additional details about slide builds, as shown below.

Although a drawer is somewhat similar to a sheet in that it attaches to a window and slides into view, the two elements are not interchangeable. Sheets are modal dialogs, whereas drawers provide additional functionality. When a sheet is open, it is the focus of the window and it obscures the window contents; when a drawer is open, the entire parent window is still visible and accessible.  
Drawers aren't widely used in modern Mac apps, and they are rarely attached to a main window. If your app design includes a drawer, you might consider replacing it with a panel or perhaps a popover. (For more information about panels, see ["Panels"](#page-205-0) (page 206); to learn about popovers, see ["Popovers"](#page-201-0) (page 202).) If you really need to provide a drawer, follow the guidelines in this section.  
**Don't enable a drawer on a window that can go full screen.** Because a drawer slides out from an edge of its parent window, a full-screen window doesn't have room to display a drawer.  
**Use drawers only for controls that need to be accessed fairly frequently but that don't need to be visible all the time.** This is in contrast to the criterion for a panel, which should be visible and available whenever its main window is in the top layer. (For more information about panels, see ["Panels"](#page-205-0) (page 206).)  
**Don't use a drawer to enable navigation.** If you need to give users a way to navigate hierarchically arranged content in your window, you should use a source list instead. To learn more about source lists, see ["Providing](#page-187-0) a [Source](#page-187-0) List" (page 188).  
**If appropriate, automatically open a drawer when the user drags an object near it.** Typically, users click a button or choose a command to show or hide a drawer. But if a drawer contains a valid drop target, you might want to open the drawer when the user drags an appropriate object to where the drawer appears.  
**Ensure that a drawer can open fully without disappearing offscreen.** When a drawer opens, it appears to be sliding from behind its parent window, to the left, right, or down. If the user moves a parent window to the edge of the screen and then opens a drawer, the drawershould open on the side of the window that hasroom. If the user makes a window so big that there's no room on either side, the drawer opens off the screen.  
**Ensure that a draweris smallerthan its parent window.** Thissize difference supportsthe illusion that a closed drawer is hidden behind its parent window. If the user vertically resizes the parent window, an open drawer resizes, if necessary, to ensure that it does not exceed the height of the parent window.  
**Automatically close a drawer if the user makes it too small to see the contents.** The user can resize an open drawer by dragging its outside border. If the user drags a drawer's border to the point where its content is mostly obscured, the drawer should simply close. For example, if a drawer contains a scrolling list, the user should be able to resize the drawer to cover up the edge of the list. But if the user makes the drawer so small that the items in the list are difficult to identify, the drawer should close. If the user resizes a drawer, your app should remember the new size and use it the next time the drawer is opened.  
**Maintain a drawer's state when its parent window becomes inactive or reopens.** For example, an open drawer should remain open when its parent window becomes inactive or when it's closed and then reopened. When the user minimizes a parent window with an open drawer, the drawer should close; the drawer should reopen when the parent window is unminimized.  
**Treat a drawer as part of the parent window.** That is, don't dim a drawer's controls when the parent window has focus, and vice versa. When full keyboard access is on, a drawer's contents should be included in the window components that users can select by pressing Tab.
