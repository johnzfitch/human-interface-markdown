A **scope bar** allows users to specify locations or rules in a search or to filter objects by specific criteria. In general,scope bars are not visible all the time, but appear when the user initiates a search orsimilar operation. Figure 14-19 shows the scope bar Safari displays when the user performs a find (because the Safari find operation does not allow the addition of scoping criteria, you can think of it as using an implied scope of "all").

#### Scope Bar Appearance and Behavior  
A scope bar is a horizontal strip that can appear just below your application's toolbar. It can be visible at all times, but is usually invisible until the user initiates an operation such as a search or find.  
Although a scope bar may contain a search field control, it often contains only two types of controls, both of which are designed solely for use in a scope bar. The first control is the recessed-style scope button, which is used to display scoping locations and categories. The second is the round rectangle–style scope button, which is used to save or manipulate a scoping operation (for details on these controls, see ["Scope](#page-270-0) [Buttons"](#page-270-0) (page 271)).  
You can also display filter rows below a scope bar that allow users to specify additional rules that help refine the scoping operation. In addition to the round rectangle–style scope button (used for selecting or saving scoping criteria), a filter row can also contain text fields that accept user input. For example, when users search in the Finder, they can click the Add button to view a new row with supplementary rules they can use to refine their search. Figure 14-20 shows a Finder window with several filter rows displayed below the scope bar.

#### Designing a Scope Bar  
Scope bars are useful for integrating search or filtering in your application. You might choose to provide a scope bar (instead of a separate Find window, for example) if you want the user's focus to remain on the window. Be sure that you use a scope bar only to specify and narrow a search or to filter items by specified criteria. If you need to provide a way for users to navigate or to select collections of items or data that should appear in the window, however, you should use a source list instead (described in ["Source](#page-207-0) Lists and [Sidebars"](#page-207-0) (page 208)). For example, the Dictionary application uses a scope bar to allow users to dynamically filter results by reference type (such as dictionary, thesaurus, or Apple dictionary), as shown in Figure 14-21.

As you choose the locations and categories that should appear in a scope bar, revisit the user's mental model of the tasks your application performs. (See ["Reflect](#page-38-3) the User's Mental Model" (page 39) for more information on discovering this cognitive model.) Determine the objects the user works with, and identify the attributes of those objects. For example, an application that allows users to create, use, and store recipes might display a scope bar when the user begins a search, providing buttons that correspond to different recipe collections.  
<span id="page-207-0"></span>If appropriate, allow users to define subsets of the locations and categories you offer by providing filter rows that display additional rules and filtering criteria. For example, the recipe application described above could display filter rowsthat allow usersto filter their results by ingredient, cuisine,seasonal availability, complexity, date last used, diet type, and other criteria. You should also allow users to save their searches. As shown in [Figure](#page-206-0) 14-20 (page 207), the Finder offers many types of additional filtering functionality and the ability to save searches.
