Grouping related controls helps users to understand what particular controls do and helps them locate the controls that affect the specific actions they want to apply. This section provides examples of different ways to group controls.  
The three examples show different ways to group the same set of controls within a changeable pane using three grouping elements:  
- Separators, shown in Figure 11-19
- White space, shown in Figure 11-21
- Group boxes, shown in Figure 11-22  
<span id="page-219-1"></span>Note that none of these examples are more or less correct than any other in the general case. The effectiveness of a layout in your application depends on the overall aesthetic layout of your other windows as well as your application's workflow.
