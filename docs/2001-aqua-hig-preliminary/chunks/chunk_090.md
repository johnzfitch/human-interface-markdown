The **tab control** provides a convenient way to present information in a multipage format. Tabs can display centered horizontally across the top or bottom edge, or centered vertically along the left or right side. [Figure 7-19](#page-103-2) shows the proper orientation of text on tabs on each of the four sides.

<span id="page-103-3"></span>The content area below a tab is called a **pane.** You can use other controls such as push buttons and scroll bars in tabbed windows too. The controls can be **global** affecting the settings of all panes—or specific to an individual pane. Make it clear through labeling and placement (within or outside of a tab pane's boundary, for example) whether a control affects one pane or all panes.  
#### <span id="page-103-0"></span>Tab Control Specifications  
- **Label text**: System font (13-point Lucida Grande), centered in tab with 12 pixels on either side
- **Accent bar height:** 7 pixels

Tab panes can extend from one edge of a window to the other, or they can be inset within a window. [Figure 7-22](#page-105-1) shows an example of tab panes that extend from one edge of a window to the other.

For inset tab panes, the recommended inset is 20 pixels on each side within a window, although 16 is also allowed. You can define a window so that space remains below the tab pane for global controls such as push buttons. [Figure 7-23](#page-106-2) shows an example of tab panes inset within a window, with buttons below the panes.
