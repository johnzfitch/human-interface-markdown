#### Special Visual Features

In addition to the way menu items are name and grouped, menus have other features that provide added information:

- An ellipsis (...) after a name means that after that item is chosen, more information will still be needed before the operation can be carried out. Usually, the user must fill in a dialog box and click an OK button or its equivalent. Don't use the ellipsis when the dialog that will appear is merely a confirmation or warning (for example, "Save changes before quitting?").
- Check marks indicate attributes that are currently in effect.
- The application dims an item when the user can't choose it. If the user moves the pointer over a dimmed item, that item isn't highlighted.
- If an item has a keyboard equivalen (if it can be chosen from the keyboard as well as from a menu), its name in the menu is followed by the Apple (or cloverleaf) symbol and a character. To choose an item this way, the user presses the character key while holding down the Apple (Command) key.
