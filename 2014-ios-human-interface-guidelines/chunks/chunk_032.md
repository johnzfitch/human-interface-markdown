In iOS 7, color helps indicate interactivity, impart vitality, and provide visual continuity. The built-in apps use a family of pure, clean colors that look great individually and in combination, and on both light and dark backgrounds.

**If you create multiple custom colors, make sure they work well together.** For example, if pastels are essential to your app's style, you should create a family of coordinating pastels that can be used throughout the app.  
**Pay attention to color contrasts in different contexts.** For example, if there's not enough contrast between the navigation bar background and the bar-button titles, the buttons will be hard for users to see. A rule of thumb is to start with a contrast of at least 50% between colors that need to be distinguishable. Test the result by viewing it on a device in different lighting conditions, including outdoors on a sunny day.

**Tip:** One way to discover areas that need higher contrast is to desaturate the UI and look at it in grayscale. If you have trouble telling the difference between interactive and noninteractive elements or backgrounds in the grayscale version, you probably need to increase the contrast between these elements.  
**Take bar translucency and app content into account when you use a custom bar tint.** If you need to create a bar tint that matches a specific color, such as a color in an existing brand, you may have to experiment with various colors before you get the results you want. A bar's appearance is affected by both the translucency that iOS provides and the appearance of the app content that can be behind the bar.  
**API Note:** To tint bar button items, use the tintColor property; to tint the bar itself, use the barTintColor property. To learn more about these bar properties, see *UINavigationBar Class Reference* , *UITabBar Class Reference* , *UIToolbar Class Reference* , and *UISearchBar Class Reference* .  
**Be aware of color blindness.** Most color blind people have difficulty distinguishing red from green. Test your app to make sure that there are no places where you use red and green asthe only way to distinguish between two states or values (some image-editing software includes tools that can help you proof for color-blindness). In general, it's a good idea to use more than one way to indicate an element'sinteractivity (to learn more about indicating interactivity in iOS 7, see ["Interactive](#page-40-0) Elements Invite Touch" (page 41)).  
**Consider choosing a key color to indicate interactivity and state.** Key colors in the built-in apps include yellow in Notes and red in Calendar. If you define a key color to indicate interactivity and state, make sure that the other colors in your app don't compete with it.  
**Avoid using the same color in both interactive and noninteractive elements.** Color is one of the ways that a UI element indicates its interactivity. If interactive and noninteractive elements have the same color, it's harder for users to know where to tap.  
**Color communicates, but not always in the way you intend.** Everyone sees color differently, and many cultures differ in how they assign meanings to colors. Spend time to research how your use of color might be perceived in other countries and cultures. As much as possible, you want to be sure that the colors in your app send the appropriate message.
