Use **pop-up menus** to present a list of mutually exclusive choices in a dialog or window. Pop-up menus are used as a means of selecting one choice from a list of many.

#### A pop-up menu  
- has a label to the left (in left-to-right scripts)
- has a drop shadow and a double triangle indicator
- behaves like other menus: users drag to choose an item—which then flashes briefly and appears as the current choice—or move outside the menu to leave the current value active. An exploratory press in the menu to see what's available doesn't select a new value.
- contains nouns (things) or adjectives (states or attributes), but not verbs (commands). Use pull-down menus for commands.  
In special cases, you may want to include a command that affects the contents of the pop-up menu itself. For example, in the Print dialog, the Printer pop-up menu contains Edit Printer List, so that users can add a printer to the menu; the new printer becomes the menu's default selection. Put such commands at the bottom of a pop-up menu, below a separator.  
Use pop-up menus to present up to 12 mutually exclusive choices that the user doesn't need to see all the time.  
Don't use pop-up menus  
- for more than 12 items; use a scrolling list
- for 4 or fewer; use radio buttons
- when more than one selection is appropriate, such as text styles (in which you can select bold and italic, for example); use checkboxes or a pull-down menu in which checkmarks appear  
Be very cautious about creating a pop-up menu with submenus. Doing so hides choices too deeply and is physically difficult to use.  
Bevel buttons and icon buttons can also be pop-up menus. See ["Pop-Up Bevel](#page-98-3)  [Buttons and Pop-Up Icon Buttons" \(page 99\)](#page-98-3).
