Mac OS X introduces a new user interface element called a drawer. A drawer is a pane that can be "opened" or "closed" (revealed or hidden) by the user. When a drawer is revealed, an animation makes it appear to be sliding from behind its parent window (hence the name drawer). It is tightly linked to its parent window, but its behavior makes it more like a part of its parent window than a sheet or palette. [Figure 1-3](#page-7-0) shows a drawer revealed next to its parent window.
