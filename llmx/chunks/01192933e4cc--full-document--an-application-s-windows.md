## **An Application's Windows**

Applications present their functionality to the user in three kinds of windows: standard windows, panels, and menus. Two other kinds of windows also appear on-screen: application icons and miniwindows.

All the user's typing goes to the current *key window,* which is one of the active application's standard windows or panels. The user can tell which is the key window by seeing which one has the black title bar. In the previous figure, the Find panel is the key window.
