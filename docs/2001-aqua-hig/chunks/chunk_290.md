- Is the instructional suite written for the right audience?
- Do you provide onscreen HTML help and a Help command in the Help menu?
- Does your documentation focus on real-world user tasks and troubleshooting?
- When appropriate, do your dialogs have help buttons that open relevant help text?
- Does your help automate common tasks using AppleScript?
- If any part of the documentation refers the user to another document, is the reference more appropriate than including the information right there?
