It is up to you to provide appropriate editing services for an edit text field. For more information about this, see "Text Entry Fields" in *Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines*.  
The **edit text frame** is used to surround an edit text field. It is useful for making a non-standard version of the edit text field Appearance-compliant. The edit text frame is two pixels wide.
