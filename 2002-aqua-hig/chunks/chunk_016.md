<span id="page-20-0"></span>Mac OS X is the world's most advanced operating system, combining a powerful core foundation with a new and compelling user interface called Aqua. With brilliant new features and an aesthetically refined use of color, transparency, and animation, Aqua makes computing even easier for new users, while providing the productivity that professional users have come to expect of the Macintosh. The user interface features, behaviors, and appearances introduced in Aqua deliver a well organized and cohesive user experience available to all applications developed for Mac OS X.  
This document, which covers features up to Mac OS X version 10.2, describes what you need to do to design your application for Aqua. Primarily intended for Carbon and Cocoa developers who want their applications to look right and behave correctly in Mac OS X, these guidelines provide examples of how to use Aqua interface elements. Java application developers will also find these guidelines useful.  
This document assumes that you are familiar with basic software design principles. Specific principles of designing for the Mac OS are summarized in the next chapter, ["Human Interface Design Principles" \(page 27\)](#page-26-1).
