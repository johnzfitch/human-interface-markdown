Keynote on iPad captures the essence of Keynote on the desktop, and makes it feel at home on iPad by creating a user experience that:  
- Focuses on the user's content
- Reduces complexity without diluting capability
- Provides shortcuts that empower and delight
- Adapts familiar hallmarks of the desktop experience
- Provides feedback and communication via eloquent animation  
Keynote users instantly understand how to use the app on iPad because it delivers expected functionality using native iPad paradigms. New users easily learn how to use Keynote on iPad because they can directly manipulate their content in simple, natural ways.  
The transformation of Keynote from the desktop to iPad is based on myriad modifications and redesignsthat range from subtle to profound. These are some of the most visible adaptations:  
**A streamlined toolbar**. Only seven items are in the toolbar, but they give users consistent access to all the functions and tools they need to create their content.

**A simplified, prioritized inspector that responds to the user's focus**. The Keynote on iPad inspector automatically containsthe tools and attributes people need to modify the selected object. Often, people can make all the modificationsthey need in the first inspector view. If they need to modify lessfrequently changed attributes, they can drill down to other inspector views.

**Lots of prebuilt style collections**. People can easily change the look and feel of objects such as charts and tables by taking advantage of the prebuilt styles. In addition to color scheme, each collection includes prestyled attributes, such as table headings and axis-division marks, that are designed to coordinate with the overall theme.

**Direct manipulation of content, enriched with meaningful animation**. In Keynote on iPad, a user drags a slide to a new position, twists an object to rotate it, and taps an image to select it. The impression of direct manipulation is enhanced by the responsive animations Keynote on iPad performs. For example, a slide pulses gently as users move it and, when they place it in a new location, the surrounding slidesripple outward to make room for it.
