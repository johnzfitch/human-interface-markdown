A NeXTSTEP keyboard resembles a conventional typewriter, with the usual keys in their traditional locations. However, the keyboard also has many keys that aren't found on typewriters, including the Command, Alternate, Control, and Help keys and a set of keys arranged in a calculator-style numeric keypad. The behavior of each key is documented in the *User's Guide.* Behavior that plays an important role in the user interface is discussed below.
