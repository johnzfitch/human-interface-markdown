### Noun, then Verb

Users generally do things in two distinct steps. First, they select the object—a document, an application, a block of text—by clicking on it. Second, they select the operation to be performed on this object—print, open, cut, paste, etc. This noun—verb sequence implies action, where the computer plays the role of getting particular objects to perform according to the user's wishes.
