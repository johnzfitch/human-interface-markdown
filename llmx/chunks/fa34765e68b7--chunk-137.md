<!-- Chunk 137 | Source: 1986-12 Human Interface Guidelines (Final Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 201 -->
Most sounds can be quite subtle and still getting their meaning across. Loud, harsh sounds can be offensive or intimidating. You should always use the sound yourself and test it on users for a significant period of time (a week or two, not twenty minutes) before including it in your application—if you turn it off after a day, chances are other people will, too. You should also avoid using tunes or jingles-more than two or three notes of a tune may become annoying or sound silly if it has to be listened to very often.  
Significant differences  
Users can learn to recognize and discriminate between sounds, but different sounds should be significantly different. Non-musicians often can't tell the difference between two similar notes or chords, especially when they're separated by a space of time.
