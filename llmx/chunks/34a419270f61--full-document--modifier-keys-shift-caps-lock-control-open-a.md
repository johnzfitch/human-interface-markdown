# Modifier Keys: Shift, Caps Lock, Control, Open-Apple, and Solid-Apple

There are five keys on the keyboard that change the interpretation of keystrokes: two labeled Shift, one labeled Control, one labeled Caps Lock, one labeled with the "Open-Apple" symbol, and one labeled with the "Solid-Apple" symbol. These keys change the interpretation of keystrokes and sometimes mouse actions. When one of these keys is held down, the effect of the other keys (or the mouse button) may change.

The Shift key chooses among the characters on each character key. Shift gives the upper character on two-character keys, or the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys.

Caps Lock latches in the down position when pressed, and releases when pressed again. When down it gives the uppercase letter on alphabetic keys. The operation of Caps Lock on alphabetic keys is parallel to that of the Shift key, but the Caps Lock key has no effect whatsoever on any of the other keys.

Pressing a character key while holding down the Control or either Apple key usually tells the application to interpret the key as a command, not as a character (see "Commands").

Control keys are reserved for functions that the user must do repeatedly with little or no concious thought. You will find standard definitions for most of them in the "Commands" section. Because these definitions remain standard throughout applications, the user has only an initial learning burden, and, since all these definitions are either short-cuts or very advanced features, the user can pick them up at their leasure.

The Open-Apple key has only a few reserved functions (see "commands"). As a general rule, it is available for your special mnemonic commands for your specific application. It is also used in conjunction with the mouse for extending a selection (as the Shift key is on a Macintosh); see "Selecting".

The Solid-Apple key generally mimics the action of the Open-Apple key. Users have been found able to learn one mnemonic per letter, for example, E for Edit. Defining Open-Apple-E to mean Edit and

Solid-Apple-E to mean something else, such as E for "Eradicate This Document" invariably leads to problems. The user must have some powerful rule which logically separates all Open-Apple combinations from all Solid-Apple combinations, if you are to use them separately.

If you want to enable your user to define keyboard macros, tie them to the Solid-Apple key: the powerful rule here is that the program owns the Open-Apple key and the user owns the Solid-Apple key.
