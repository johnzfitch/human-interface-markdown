# Designing for disabled people

Computers hold tremendous promise for people with many kinds of disabilities. In terms of increasing productivity and mobility, computers can have a far greater impact on disabled people than on other users. But too often, computers become obstacles rather than enablers, because many disabilities make it hard to use standard computers and software. In most cases, thoughtful hardware design is the solution, but there are things that software designers can do, too.

Many of the modifications that make programs easier for disabled people to use are simple and inexpensive to make, and they often have a welcome and unexpected side effect—the programs are easier for everyone to use. Although sidewalk curb cuts are designed to help people who rely on crutches or wheelchairs, they are used and appreciated almost as much by skateboarders and stroller-pushers.

This section describes some of the ways you can design with disabled users in mind. For more information, contact Apple's Office of Special Education Programs.
