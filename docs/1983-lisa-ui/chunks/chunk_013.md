A form is a request for information that the application makes to the user. It consists of a fixed arrangement of text fields, check boxes, and cuttons. The user provides the requested information by filling in the fields and checking the boxes. A form is therefore more restrictive than the other styles in the range of operations the user can do. A dialog box is an example of a form.  
Figure 1-5 shows a window containing a typical form (from the printing dialog box).
