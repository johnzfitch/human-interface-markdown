Additionally, Help Viewer allows you to integrate Internet-based help files, permitting you to update and improve your instructions as often as necessary.  
<span id="page-236-4"></span>The collection of your HTML help files is called a **help book**. When you use Help Viewer, your help book automatically becomes accessible via the Help Center, an Apple-provided location that allows users to easily browse and search all of the help available on their system.  
A help book should be the primary location for your application's user instructions and information. If you provide other instructional resources, such as full-screen tutorials or "how to" articles on your website, include hyperlinks to them in your help book. Users can find these other resources by searching or browsing the help, reinforcing its usefulness as a reference.
