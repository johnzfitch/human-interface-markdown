Feedback and communication encompassfar more than labeling buttons and displaying alerts when something goes wrong. Instead, these concepts are about establishing and maintaining a continuous conversation with users that keeps them informed about what's happening and gives them a sense of control.  
For example, when users initiate an action, they need to know that the app has received their input and is operating on it. When a command can't be carried out, users need to know why it can't and what they can do instead. Subtle animation can be a great way to communicate responsiveness and show usersthat a requested action is being carried out. For example, when a user clicks an icon in the Dock, the icon bounces to let the user know that the app is opening.  
Animation can also clarify the relationships between objects and the consequences of user actions. For example:  
- When a user minimizes a window, it doesn't just disappear. Instead, it smoothly slips into the Dock, clearly telling the user where to find it again.
- To communicate the relationship between a sheet and a window, the sheet unfurls from the window's title bar.
- To emphasize the relationship between a popover and content in a window, the popover emerges from the user's point of contact and floats above the window to show that it contains a separate task.  
Discoverability is closely related to feedback and communication. In its conversation with users, an app encourages users to discover functionality by providing cues about how to use UI elements. For example, active elements appear clickable, the pointer can show where keyboard input will go, and informative labels and menu items describe what users can do. Standard OS X controls and views automatically communicate their purpose and usability to users.
