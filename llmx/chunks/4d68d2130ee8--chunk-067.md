<!-- Chunk 67 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 131 -->
The best approach to developing software that is easy to use is to keep the design as simple as possible. (The general design guideline that simple design is good design applies directly to the discipline of human-computer interactions.) The challenge that users desire is to solve their problems using the tools that you design to facilitate their work. The more you can do to simplify the interface and your product for your users, the more likely it is that you will build a product that meets their needs and expectations.
