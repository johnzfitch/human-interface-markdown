## **Sliders**

A slider is a device that sets a value. As illustrated below, it consists of a vertical or horizontal *bar* and a *knob* that moves on the bar.

The position of the knob in the slider indicates its current value. Users can move the knob, and thus alter the value, by positioning the cursor anywhere over the bar (even the part of the bar that's covered by the knob) and pressing the mouse button. The knob immediately jumps to the location of the cursor. The user can release the mouse button to fix the knob in its new location, or begin dragging the knob along the bar.

A slider can set values on a continuous scale (between some maximum and minimum) or values at discrete intervals. If the latter, the knob jumps to the position of the nearest permitted value when the user releases the mouse button. When the user presses the Alternate key and drags the slider's knob, the slider should set values at precise, discrete increments that are smaller than the usual increment for unmodified dragging.

The user should always be able to detect a direct effect of manipulating the slider's knob-this is usually done in a text field or label next to the slider (as shown in the following figure).
