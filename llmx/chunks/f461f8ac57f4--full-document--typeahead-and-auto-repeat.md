# Typeahead and Auto-Repeat

If the user types when a windowing application is unable to process the keystrokes immediately, or types more quickly than a toolkit can handle, the extra keystrokes are queued, to be processed later. This queuing is called typeahead. There's a limit in each toolkit to the number of keystrokes that can be queued, but the limit is usually not a problem unless the user types while the application is performing a lengthy operation.

The toolkits can be operated in two modes: with interupts or passive. When interrupts are on, queuing is done "automatically"; in passive-mode, queuing is done periodically, as described in the toolkit manuals. Remember in testing that the toolkits will shift to passive-mode automatically on an Apple IIe with no mouse card installed (as the interrupts are generated by the mouse card). So be sure to test your software for mouseless operation on a IIe without a card plugged in!

When the user holds down a character key for a certain amount of time, it starts repeating automatically. An application cannot tell whether a series of n keystrokes was generated by auto-repeat or by pressing the same key n times. Therefore, be sensitive to the discovery of a vast number of identical keystrokes—your user may have erred in holding the key down too long.

Holding down a modifier key has the same effect as pressing it once. However, if the user holds down a modifier key and a character key at the same time, the effect is the same as if the user held down the modifier key while pressing the character key repeatedly.
