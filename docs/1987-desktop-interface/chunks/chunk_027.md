<!-- Chunk 27 | Source: 1987 Apple Human Interface Guidelines - The Apple Desktop Interface.pdf | Est. Tokens: 141 -->
To implement the principles stated in Chapter 1, Apple has defined two classes of standard interface elements for the Apple Desktop Interface:  
- screen elements that define the "look" of the Apple Desktop Interface
- conventions for human-computer interactions that account for the "feel" of the interface  
The consistent "look and feel" of this interface makes users feel comfortable when they use a range of applications on Apple computers.  
Both kinds of elements are introduced briefly in this chapter. Chapter 3 provides details of their content and form.
