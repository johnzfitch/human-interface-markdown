There are several kinds of windows: Document windows, dialog windows, and alert windows. Most of this section deals with document windows; dialogs and alerts are discussed together at the end of this section. Because controls appear only in windows, they are also discussed throughout this section.  
Each kind of window is made up of several parts, some of which are optional. The application determines the *content* of the window. This section is about a window's structural components (title bar, size box, close box, zoom box, and scroll bars).
