Take advantage of people's knowledge of the world by using metaphors to convey concepts and features of your application. Metaphors are the building blocks in the user's mental model of a task. Use metaphors that represent concrete, familiar ideas, and make the metaphors obvious, so that users can apply a set of expectations to the computer environment. For example, Mac OS X uses the metaphor of file folders for storing documents; people can organize their hard disks in a way that is analogous to the way they organize file cabinets. Other metaphor examplesinclude iTunes playlists and iPhoto albums, which represent real-world music playlists and photo albums. A Dashboard widget can also be a metaphor for the task it performs because it instantly conveys its purpose to the user. (For Dashboard widget design guidelines, see ["Dashboard"](#page-71-0) (page 72).)  
<span id="page-38-3"></span>Metaphorsshould suggest a use for a particular element, but that use doesn't have to limit the implementation of the metaphor. It isimportant to strike a balance between the metaphor'ssuggested use and the computer's ability to support and extend the metaphor. For example, the number of items a user puts in the Trash is not limited to the number of items a physical wastebasket could hold.
