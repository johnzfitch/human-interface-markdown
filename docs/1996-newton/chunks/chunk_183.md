If a search finds just one item, that item is displayed behind the Find slip. If a search finds more than one item, the Find service displays an overview list of the found items. [Figure 8-11](#page-253-0) depicts a Find overview as it might appear after searching all applications for "man."

A user can alternately hide and reveal the names of items listed under an application in the Find overview by tapping the application name there. Tapping the name of an item in the Find overview displays a detail view of the item. The Find slip stays open in front of the detail view. A message at the top of the Find slip states which item is displayed and whether other items were found in the same application. [Figure 8-12](#page-254-0) shows an example of the message.

If more than one item was found, tapping the universal down arrow goes to the next found item, and tapping the universal up arrow goes to the previous found item. Tapping the Overview button redisplays the overview of found items.  
Between uses, the Find service stores the setting of the Look For picker. The next time a user taps the Find button, the Find slip reopens with the most recent search criteria preset. Note that in order to conserve memory, the overview list of found items is not saved between uses of the Find service.
