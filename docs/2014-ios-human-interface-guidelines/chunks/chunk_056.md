The best iOS apps balance UI customization with clarity of purpose and ease of use. To achieve this balance in your app, be sure to consider customization early in the design process. Because concerns about branding, originality, and marketability often influence customization decisions, it can be challenging to stay focused on how customization impacts the user experience.  
Start by considering the tasks in your app: How often do users perform them and under what circumstances?  
For example, imagine an app that enables phone calls. Now imagine that instead of a keypad, the app displays a beautiful, realistic rotary dial. The dial is meticulously rendered,so users appreciate its quality. The dial behaves realistically, so users delight in making the old-fashioned dialing gesture and hearing the distinctive sounds.  
But for users who often need to dial phone numbers, initial appreciation of the experience soon gives way to frustration, because using a rotary dial is much less efficient than using a keypad. In an app that is designed to help people make phone calls, this beautiful custom UI is a hindrance.

On the other hand, consider the BubbleLevel sample app, which displays a realistic rendition of a carpenter's level. People know how to use the physical tool so they instantly know how to use the app. The app could have displayed its information without the rendition of the bubble vial, but this would have made the app less intuitive and perhaps harder to use. In this case, the custom UI not only shows people how to use the app, it also makes the task easier to accomplish.

As you think about how customization might enhance or detract from the task your app enables, keep these guidelines in mind.  
**Always have a reason for customization.** Ideally, UI customization facilitates the task people want to perform and enhances their experience. As much as possible, you need to let your app's task drive your customization decisions.  
**As much as possible, avoid increasing the user's cognitive burden.** Users are familiar with the appearance and behavior of the standard UI elements, so they don't have to stop and think about how to use them. When faced with elements that don't look or behave at all like standard ones, users lose the advantage of their prior experience. Unless your unique elements make performing the task easier, users might dislike being forced to learn new procedures that don't transfer to any other apps.  
**Be internally consistent.** The more custom your UI is, the more important it isfor the appearance and behavior of your custom elements to be consistent within your app. If users take the time to learn how to use the unfamiliar controls you create, they expect to be able to rely on that knowledge throughout your app.  
**Always defer to the content.** Because the standard elements are so familiar, they don't compete with the content for people's attention. As you customize your UI, take care to ensure that it doesn't overshadow the content people care about. For example, if your app allows people to watch videos, you might choose to design custom playback controls. But whether you use custom or standard playback controls is less important than whether the controls fade out after the user begins watching the video and reappear with a tap.  
**Think twice before you redesign a standard control.** If you plan on doing more than customizing a standard control, make sure your redesigned control provides as much information as the standard one. For example, if you create a switch control that doesn't indicate the presence of the opposite value, people might not realize that it's a two-state control.  
**Be sure to thoroughly user-test custom UI elements.** During testing, closely observe users to see if they can predict what your elements do and if they can interact with them easily. If, for example, you create a control that has a hit target smaller than 44 x 44 points, people will have trouble activating it. Or if you create a view that responds differently to a tap than it does to a swipe, be sure the functionality the view provides is worth the extra care people have to take when interacting with it.
