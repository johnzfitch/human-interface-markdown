#### **Controls**  
Controls are devices that let users give information to or choose an action in an application. Controls are usually presented to users in panels or menus, although standard windows can also contain controls. The following figure shows some of the controls used in NeXTSTEP. (Although menu commands are controls, they're used only in menus, so they're illustrated in the "Menus" section, earlier).

The following sections describe each of the NeXTSTEP controls in more detail. If necessary, you can also create your own controls. Chapter 7, "Controls," has more information.
