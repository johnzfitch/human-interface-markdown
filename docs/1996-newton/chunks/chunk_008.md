*Newton 2.0 User Interface Guidelines* helps you link the philosophy behind the Newton 2.0 interface to the actual implementation of the interface elements. Examples from a range of Newton software show good human interface design. These examples are augmented by descriptions and discussions of the reasoning behind the guidelines.
