Under certain circumstances, Safari on iPhone provides to users some built-in conveniences, such as a keyboard, a navigation bar, and a form assistant. The fact that these user interface components are built in means you don't have to replicate them in your content, but it also means that you may need to take them into account when you design your layout. Thisis especially true for the layout of an iPhone web application's user interface.  
An **HTML form** is a section of an HTML document that contains special elements that users interact with, such as buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. Userstypically enter text,select menu items, or check checkboxes and then submit the form to a web server for processing. The following sections describe how to work with the user interface objects that Safari on iPhone displays for some of the controls in HTML forms.  
#### <span id="page-39-1"></span>Keyboards  
When users tap an input element in a webpage form, Safari on iPhone automatically displays the keyboard and the form assistant in place of the button bar. The form assistant contains iPhone controls users tap to move among form controls and to dismiss the keyboard.  
There are two ways you can handle the display of forms in your content. One way is to allow Safari on iPhone to automatically zoom in and center each form control in turn as the user taps it. The other way is to specify a form layout that fits the available area of the screen when the keyboard and form assistant are displayed.  
The first method is suitable for webpages that don't look and behave like an iPhone web application. When you define a form in such a webpage, you can count on Safari on iPhone to automatically zoom in on and center an individual form control when the user taps it and simultaneously display a keyboard and the form assistant. When the user taps Next or Previous in the form assistant, Safari on iPhone automatically centers and displays the next or previous form control.  
**Note:** If you choose to turn off userscaling, be aware that you also lose the automatic zoom on form controls. User scaling is one of the viewport properties you can set using the viewport metatag, introduced in ["Lay](#page-32-0) Out [Content](#page-32-0) for Safari on iPhone" (page 33).  
The second method of handling formsin your content issuitable for an iPhone web application. As described in"Lay Out [Content](#page-32-0) for Safari on iPhone" (page 33), you've already set the viewport width and height properties to ensure your content fitsthe screen precisely. In addition, you've turned off user-scaling so your application looks right in both portrait and landscape orientation. Then, if your application needs to display a form, you need to determine the screen size that's available when the keyboard and form assistant are visible, and lay out your content to fit.  
When a keyboard and the form assistant are visible, Safari on iPhone displays your webpage in the area below the URL text field and above the keyboard and form assistant, as shown in Figure 4-12.  
Status bar: 20 pixels URL text field: 60 pixels Remaining space: 140 pixels Form assistant: 44 pixels

When a keyboard and the form assistant are not displayed, there is an additional 216 pixels of vertical space available (in portrait orientation) for the display of your webpage (as shown in [Figure](#page-33-0) 4-5 (page 34)).  
Keyboard: 216 pixels  
In landscape orientation, two of the values differ: The keyboard height is 162 pixels, and the form assistant height is 32 pixels.  
**Note:** In iPhone OS 1.1 and earlier, the keyboard height in landscape orientation is 180 pixels.  
Notice that the keyboard in [Figure](#page-40-1) 4-12 (page 41) displays a return button in the lower-right corner. The label of this button can change, depending on the type of the input control. For example, a search field causes the lower-right button to be labeled Search.

#### The Pop-up Menu  
When users tap a pop-up menu style selection control in a webpage or iPhone web application, Safari on iPhone displays a custom user interface control that differs from the corresponding control Safari displays on the desktop. In Safari on the desktop, a pop-up menu that contains a large number of items displays as it does in a Mac OS X application; that is, the menu opens to display all items, extending past the window boundaries, if necessary. Users can scroll through the list itself to see each item.  
On the small iPhone screen, however, it's too difficult for users to scroll through an open menu without also scrolling the surrounding page. Therefore, Safari on iPhone automatically displays a unique style of list when users tap a pop-up menu control. Figure 4-13 shows the list Safari on iPhone displays when a user taps the Apple.com Worldwide pop-up menu on the Apple website.
