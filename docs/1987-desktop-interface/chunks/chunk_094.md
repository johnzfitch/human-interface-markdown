Strictly speaking, *everything* on a Macintosh screen is displayed graphically. Still, it's useful to distinguish among three types of objects—text, graphics, and lists or arrays—because the user deals with each of them in a different way. Figure 3-52 shows an example of each.  
The rest to some faint meaning make pretence But Shadwell never deviates into sense. Some beams of wit on other souls may fall, Strike through and make <sup>a</sup> lucid interval, But Shadwell's genuine night admits no rag. His rising fogs prevail upon the day.

Figure 3-52 Three ways of structuring information  
Text can be arranged on the screen in a variety of ways. Some applications, such as word processors, might consist of nothing but text, whereas others, such as graphicsoriented applications, might use text almost incidentally. It's useful to consider all the text appearing together in a particular context as a block of text. The size of the block can range from a single field, as in a dialog box, to the whole document, as in a word processor. Regardless of its size or arrangement, the application sees each block as a one-dimensional string of characters. Text is edited the same way regardless of where it appears.  
Arrays are one- or two-dimensional arrangements of fields. One-dimensional arrays are called lists, and two-dimensional arrays are called tables or forms. Each field, in turn, contains <sup>a</sup> collection of information, usually text, but possibly graphics. A table can be easily identified on the screen, because itconsists of rows and columns of <sup>|</sup> fields (sometimes called cells) separated by horizontal and vertical lines. A form is something the user fills out, like a tax form or credit-card application. The fields in a form can be arranged in any appropriate way, nevertheless, the application regards the fields as being in a definite linear order.  
Graphics are pictures, drawn either by the user or by the application. Graphics in <sup>a</sup> document tend to (but do not have to) consist of discrete objects, each of which can be selected individually.  
Each of these three ways of presenting information retains its integrity regardless of the context in which it appears. For example, <sup>a</sup> field in an array can contain text. When the user is manipulating the field as a whole, the field is treated as part of the array. When the user wants to change the contents of the field, he or she edits the field in the same way as any other text  
This section discusses first the general methods of selecting and then the specific methods that apply to text applications, graphics applications, and arrays.
