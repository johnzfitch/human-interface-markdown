Tools are available to help you apply the design principles and interface specifications outlined in this document. Which tool to use depends on your application's type:  
- **Carbon:** If your application is written and compiled using the Carbon API (Universal Interfaces version 3.3.2 or later), use **Interface Builder** to import existing resources and convert them to nib files. Interface Builder provides a rich environment for creating application menus, windows, dialogs, palettes, and other standard Aqua interface elements. Interface Builder is on the Mac OS X Developer Tools CD, or you can download it from the Apple Developer Connection website (http://developer.apple.com/membership/index.html).
- If your application uses standard system resources (such as WIND, DLOG, DITL) and you don't wish to transition to nib files, use ResEdit or Resorcerer to modify your window layouts. If you have custom controls (CDEF) or nonstandard interface elements that you want to display properly in Aqua, use the Appearance Manager. For more information, see the next section, "Using the Appearance Manager."
- **Cocoa:** If your application is written using Cocoa, use Interface Builder to design your menus, windows, dialogs, and standard controls. (See the previous paragraphs for more information about Interface Builder.)
- **Java:** If your application is written using Java, take advantage of JFC/Swing, which provides the Aqua look and feel by default. For more information, go to http://java.sun.com/SFC.
