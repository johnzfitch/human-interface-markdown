More than one modifier key can be used in combination with an arrow key, with additive results. Thus, Shift-Alternate-right arrow extends the selection to the end of a word, and Control-Shift-up arrow places the insertion point at the beginning of a word in the first visible line of the display. However, Alternate and Control can't be used together because that combination is reserved by the system as a substitute for the Help key.
