Opening a container view makes it visible and gives the user access to it (unless it is partly or completely obscured by another container view that's already open). Some of an application's container views open in response to user actions. Tapping an icon in the Extras Drawer may open an application's main view; tapping a button, tapping a text label marked with a black diamond, or choosing from a picker may open a plain slip, a confirmation alert, or a palette. In addition, an application may open status slips, notification alerts, and other views on its own.
