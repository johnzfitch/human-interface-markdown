Only those desk accessories installed in the current system fIle can be called from the Apple menu. There are some desk accessories that are linked to a particular application-for example, spelling checkers that appear in the Apple menu only when a word processing application is active.

The Apple menu also contains the *About...* menu item. Choosing this item brings up a dialog box with the name, version number, and copyright information for the current application, as well as any other information the application developer wants to display. The *Help* item is also commonly in the Apple menu. In some applications, the *Help* and *About...* functions are combined in one menu item.
