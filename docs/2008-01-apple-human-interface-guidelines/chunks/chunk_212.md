Because a bottom bar is part of the window frame, it has the same gray gradient surface that is visible in the toolbar–title bar area.  
Bottom bars can contain either regular-size or small rectangular-style toolbar controls; bottom bars should not contain icon buttons, capsule-style toolbar controls, custom controls, or anystandard Aqua controls. See ["Controls](#page-259-1) for Toolbars and Bottom Bars" (page 260) for more information about controls that are suitable for use in a bottom bar.  
**Important:** Ifyou choose to use system-provided images in your bottom-bar controls, be sure to avoid redefining their meanings. For example, use the Quick Look symbol to mean "preview with Quick Look" only; don't use it to mean "magnify."  
At the top of Figure 14-26 you can see the Address Book bottom bar (which uses small controls) and below it you can see the iCal bottom bar (which uses regular-size controls).

#### <span id="page-214-1"></span>Designing a Bottom Bar  
Because of its subordinate position at the bottom edge of thewindow, a bottom bar should not contain controls for the most frequently used commands. After all, users don't typically look at the bottom area of a window more often than they look at the top area, so placing the most important controls at the bottom makes them harder to find. However, although items in a bottom bar are less frequently used than items in a toolbar, you should still take care to choose items that give users an easy way to perform common tasks.  
Unlike toolbars, bottom bars are not user-customizable, so it's especially important to provide a set of useful controls that is neither toogeneral nor too specific. To help you determinewhich commands will be the most useful in the bottom bar of your window, be sure you understand the user's mental model of the tasks users perform with your application. To learn more about this concept, see ["Reflect](#page-41-0) the User's Mental [Model"](#page-41-0) (page 42).  
After you've decided what commands you want to provide in a bottom bar, you need to choose or create simple, streamlined icons that are easily recognized as metaphors for these tasks. (Note that you can also use a text label in a bottom-bar control, such as "Edit.") If possible, you should use the system-provided images (described in ["System-Provided](#page-154-0) Images" (page 155)) because users are already familiar with their meanings. If you must design an icon for a bottom-bar control, try to imitate the clean lines of the system-provided images, as iCal does for its to-do bottom-bar control, shown in Figure 14-27. (For more information on designingicons for use in bottom-bar controls, see ["Designing](#page-153-2) Icons for [Rectangular-Style](#page-153-2) Toolbar Controls" (page 154).)

As with toolbar items, every bottom-bar item should also be available as a menu command. Also, bottom bars should not contain contextual menus. If you need to offer a collection of commands that users can perform on a selected item in the window body, provide an Action menu control that displays the system-provided Action image (see "Action [Menus"](#page-295-0) (page 296) for more information on this control).  
To decide whether to use regular-size or small controls in a bottom bar, consider the prominence these controls should have and the overall look of your window.  
<span id="page-215-0"></span>Create a bottom bar by leaving a horizontal strip of the window frame visible below the window body content view. If you want to place regular-size controls in a bottom bar, leave a strip that is 32 pixels high; if you want to use small controls, leave a strip that is 22 pixels high. For guidelines that help you place text and controls in a bottom bar, see ["Positioning](#page-367-0) Text and Controls in a Bottom [Bar"](#page-367-0) (page 368).
