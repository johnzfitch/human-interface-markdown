After you've met the minimum requirements, you should concentrate on delivering the features users expect. Macintosh users are sophisticated and most have come to expect a certain level of functionality and elegance in the applications they use. Although the guidelines in this section are not as elementary as those described in "Meet Minimum [Requirements"](#page-52-1) (page 53), they embody key features your application should provide.  
To deliver the features Macintosh users expect, be sure to:  
■ Communicate effectively.  
Mac OS X excels at providing essential information to users in an integrated and effective manner. Similarly, your application should provide useful error messages, feedback on commands and lengthy tasks, and appropriate status information. For information on how to do this, see ["Feedback](#page-41-1) and [Communication"](#page-41-1) (page 42).  
■ Support application bundles and drag-and-drop installation.  
Application bundles simplify the user's interaction with your software and enable drag-and-drop installation, which isthe preferred method of application installation in Mac OS X. Macintosh users expect a quick, painless application installation experience; be sure to supply it by making your application available in a bundle and supporting drag-and-drop installation. For more information on bundles and application installation, see ["Packaging"](#page-82-1) (page 83) and ["Installation"](#page-83-0) (page 84).  
■ Create high-quality icons and graphics.  
Part of the allure of Mac OS X is the abundance of beautiful, realistic, photo-illustrative icons. Be sure your application displays the type of high-quality, attractive icons Macintosh users expect. For guidance on different types of icons and how to design them, see ["Icons"](#page-134-0) (page 135).  
■ Comply with the layout guidelines.  
Applications that follow the layout guidelines present a clean, organized, and intuitive look and feel to users. Macintosh users are accustomed to uncluttered, visually appealing windows with conveniently placed controls. For help with the spacing of individual controls, see ["Controls"](#page-248-0) (page 249); for some examples showing how to combine controls in windows, see "Layout [Guidelines"](#page-336-0) (page 337).  
■ Provide effective user assistance.  
Effective and readily available user assistance is a hallmark of a good application. Mac OS X supports both Apple Help, which allows you to display in-depth help documents in Help Viewer, and help tags, which allow you to display brief, context-sensitive information about user interface elements. Because these help mechanisms are used extensively by the system, Apple applications, and most third-party applications, Macintosh users rely on them when they need help with a task or control. For more information on using these mechanisms to provide help to your users, see "User [Assistance"](#page-79-0) (page 80).  
■ Support drag and drop.  
Drag-and-drop functionality is ubiquitous in Mac OS X, making it one of the most appreciated and well-known features of the platform. Although you should be sure to provide keyboard alternatives to the drag-and-drop operations in your application, it's essential to fully support this direct manipulation technology. For more information on this technology, see "Drag and [Drop"](#page-116-0) (page 117).  
■ Use display names.  
Mac OS X allows users to customize how file, directory, and application names are displayed. Macintosh users are accustomed to making this choice and expect their preference to be observed throughout the file system and in applications. Be sure to respect the user's display name preference in your application (note that this also makes internationalization much easier). For more information about filename extensions and display names, see "File Formats and Filename [Extensions"](#page-62-1) (page 63).
