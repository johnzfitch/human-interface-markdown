A Share extension typically takes asinput the user's current context or currently selected content. While reading an article in Safari, for example, a user might click the Share button and use a Share extension to post the webpage to a sharing website. Or while editing a document, a user mightselect a passage, open the contextual menu, and choose the Messages extension to share the selection with a contact.  
**As much as possible, use the system-provided UI in a Share extension.** The system-provided compose view controller gives users a consistent experience and automatically supports common tasks, such as previewing and validating standard items, synchronizing content and view animation, and configuring a post. To learn more about using the system-provided compose view controller, see Share in *App Extension Programming Guide* .  
**Consider displaying the progress of a lengthy upload in a Share extension's containing app.** People expect to return to their previous context immediately after tapping an extension's Post or Share button, even when the shared content is large. You need to make progress updates available, but people don't want to get a  
notification every time an upload completes, and there's no way to programmatically relaunch an extension. In this scenario, it can work well to display the progress of the upload in the containing app, which can handle the task in the background and send a notification if there's a problem.
