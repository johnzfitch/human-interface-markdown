For a field that can have just one of a few unchanging values, an application can use a cluster of radio buttons. A user selects an input from a cluster of radio buttons by tapping one of the radio buttons. This automatically deselects the previously selected radio button in the cluster. A cluster of radio buttons always offers the same choices; the radio buttons never change dynamically depending on context. Figure 6-4 shows a sample cluster of radio buttons.

Notice that a cluster of radio buttons offers a user the same choices as a short picker. On the downside, radio buttons take up more space in a view than a picker because they are always visible in the view. On the upside, being always visible makes radio buttons faster and easier to use than a picker. There's no need to tap and a wait (however briefly) for anything to pop up.
