<span id="page-98-2"></span>A **switch control** presents to the user two mutually exclusive choices or states, such as yes/no or on/off. A switch control shows only one of the two possible choices at a time; users slide the control to reveal the hidden choice or state. Figure 8-11 shows examples of switch controls.

Table Views, Text Views, and Web Views  
Use a switch control in a grouped table view when you need to offer the user two simple, diametrically opposed choices. Because one choice is always hidden, it's best to use a switch control when the user already knows what both values are. In other words, don't make the user slide the switch control just to find out what the other option is.  
You can use a switch control to change the state of other user interface elements in the view. Depending on the choice users make, new list items might appear or disappear, or list items might become active or inactive.
