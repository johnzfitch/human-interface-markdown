Computers often introduce a new level of complexity for people. If people are to cope with this complexity, they need some stable reference points. The Macintosh interface is designed to provide a computer environment that is understandable, familiar, and predictable.  
To give users a visual sense of stability, the Macintosh interface provides the desktop, a two-dimensional space on which objects are placed. It also defines a number of consistent graphics elements (menu bar, window border, and so on) to maintain the illusion of stability. Note that it is the *perception* of stability that you want to preserve, not stability in any strict physical sense.  
To give users a conceptual sense of stability, the interface provides a clear, finite set of objects and a clear, finite set of actions to perform on those objects. Even when particular actions are unavailable, they are not eliminated from a display but are merely dimmed.
