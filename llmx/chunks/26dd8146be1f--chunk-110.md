The Apple employees who created the Apple Desktop Interface had been involved in, or were influenced by, important research done at several institutions over the previous twenty or more years.  
In the early 1960s, the Augmentation Research Project at SRI International made important contributions. Its focus was the "augmentation of human intellect." This notion puts the human being, rather than technology, at the center of human-computer interactions and resulted in some unique concepts of what a human interface should be. Most directly, it implied that the goal of human-computer interactions was the enhancement of human performance, in contrast to other contemporary efforts that focused either on technology development in isolation, or on the development of control panels that helped people "keep up with" and guide powerful computational systems.  
This augmentation approach led to hardware innovations, the principal example of which is the mouse, which lets people drive computer interactions by pointing at the screen rather than typing commands at the keyboard. This approach is a central tenet of the Apple Desktop Interface.  
Important work at Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC) extended the concept of humans at the center of human-computer interactions. In the early 1970s, PARC provided the first explicit expression of the computer desktop. PARC's desktop featured windows that overlap on the screen, much like overlapping pieces of paper on a real desktop. Icons, typically representing familiar objects, appeared on the desktop to provide direct and visible access to files, operations, and so on. Bit-mapped graphics enabled users to directly combine text and graphics.  
At Apple in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the development of the Lisa® computer carried the work still further. A range of features now familiar in the Apple Desktop Interface—including the menu bar, the one-button mouse, dialog boxes, the Clipboard, and the trash can—were introduced with the Lisa. This palette of consistent elements made Lisa very easy to learn and use.  
The Apple Macintosh™ computer made these human interface features more approachable and available on a less expensive machine, again emphasizing the humanness of the machine and the computer's role as a tool for magnifying human capability.  
The Apple Desktop Interface can be implemented to some degree on any Apple computer. The goal is to provide a consistent interface for users of many machines, so that users can take advantage of the unique features of each machine within the context of a familiar and approachable interface.
