When you measure a list box for layout, don't include the bevel outside the black line.  
For a list box title, leave 6 pixels of space between the baseline of the text and the black line of a list box. This spacing allows room for the keyboard focus ring. The horizontal spacing varies depending on the list contents. Figure 3-35 shows the spacing for a text title of a list box.
