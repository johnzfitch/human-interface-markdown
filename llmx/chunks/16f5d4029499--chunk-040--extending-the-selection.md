#### **Extending the Selection**  
Normally, as soon as users commit themselves to a new selection by pressing a mouse button (to begin clicking or dragging), the current selection is canceled in favor of the new one. However, when the Alternate or Shift key is held down, the current selection is extended, not canceled.
