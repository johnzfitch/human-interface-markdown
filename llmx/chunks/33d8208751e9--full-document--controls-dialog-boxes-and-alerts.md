# Controls, dialog boxes, and alerts

Selecting the single object of an operation and then choosing <sup>a</sup> menu command works well whenever operations are simple and act on only one object. For those times when <sup>a</sup> command requires more than one object or needs additional information before it can be executed, the Apple Desktop Interface includes

- dialog boxes, to allow the user to provide the needed additional information before <sup>a</sup> command is executed
- alerts, to notify the user whenever an unusual situation occurs

Because dialog and alert boxes often use controls, controls are described in this section, even though they're also used in other kinds of windows.

Most dialog and alert boxes should be centered in the upper third of the screen, whatever size screen they're displayed on. The exception to this is a dialog or alert box whose placement is linked to something else on the screen, such as <sup>a</sup> dialog box that appears with its default button in the same place as the menu item that brought up the dialog box, allowing the user to click the button without moving the mouse.
