<span id="page-24-2"></span>To help you visualize ways you can create an iPhone OS version of a desktop computer application, this section describes some of the design differences between familiar Mac OS X applications and their iPhone OS counterparts. As you learn about which features and functions in each application were adapted for its iPhone OS version, you will gain insight into the types of design decisions you need to make for your own iPhone application.  
#### Mail  
Mail is one of the most highly visible, well-used, and appreciated applications in Mac OS X. It is also a very powerful program, one that allows users to create, receive, prioritize, and store email, track action items and events, and create notes and invitations. Mail provides most of thisfunctionality in a single multipane window. Thisis convenient for people using a desktop computer, because they can leave a Mail window on the display screen (or minimized to the Dock) all the time and switch to it whenever they choose. Figure 1-6 illustrates many of the features available in the Mail message-viewing and compose windows on the desktop.

But when people are mobile, their needs for an email application are simpler, and they want access to core functionality quickly. For thisreason, Mail on iPhone OS–based devicesfocuses on the most important things people do with their email: receive, create, send, and organize messages. To do this, it displays a pared-down user interface that makes the organization of the user's accounts and mailboxes clear and centers the user's attention on the messages.  
Mail in iPhone OS is a perfect example of a productivity style application: To ease navigation through the content, Mail in iPhone OS takes advantage of the naturally hierarchical organization of people's email and displays on successive pages accounts, mailboxes, message lists, and individual messages. Users drill down from the general (the list of accounts) to the specific (a message) by selecting an item in a list and viewing the things associated with that item. To learn more about the productivity style of iPhone applications, see "Productivity [Applications"](#page-18-0) (page 19).  
In addition, Mail in iPhone OS enables actions, such as create and send, by displaying a handful of familiar controls that are easy to tap. Figure 1-7 shows how Mail makes it simple to view and send email in iPhone OS. Note how elements at the top of each screen make it easy for users to know both their current and previous location in the application.

#### <span id="page-26-0"></span>iPhoto  
Another instructive example of a Mac OS X application that was reimagined for iPhone OS is iPhoto. On the desktop, iPhoto supports comprehensive searching and organization, powerful editing capabilities, and creative printing options. When people use iPhoto on their desktop or laptop computers, they appreciate being able to see and organize their entire collection, make adjustments to photos, and manipulate them in various ways. Although the main focus of iPhoto is on the user's content, the application also offers extensive functionality in its window. Figure 1-8 shows the iPhoto user interface on the desktop.

But when they're mobile, people don't have time to edit their photos (and they don't expect to print them); instead, they want to be able to quickly see and share their photos.  
To meet this need on iPhone OS–based devices, Apple has provided the Photos application, which focuses on viewing photos and sharing them with others. The Photos user interface revolves around photos;so much so, in fact, that even parts of the device user interface can be hidden. When users choose to view a slideshow of their photos, the Photos application hides the navigation bar, toolbar, and even status bar, and displays translucent versions of these elements when users need to see them.  
Photos makes it easy for users to organize and find their photos by using a hierarchical arrangement: Users select an album, which contains a collection of photos, and then they select a single photo from the collection. In this way, Photos is an example of an application that combines features of the productivity style and the immersive style (to learn more about these styles, see "Three [Application](#page-17-1) Styles" (page 18)). Figure 1-9 shows how users can view photos in the Photos application.

<span id="page-28-1"></span>In addition, Photos uses a transient view, called an action sheet (described in "Alerts, Action [Sheets,](#page-68-0) and Modal [Views"](#page-68-0) (page 69)), to give users additional functionality without taking them out of the photo-viewing experience. Figure 1-10 shows how Photos provides options for using an individual photo.
