Good graphic design begins with an understanding of the situation the user is in or of the problem being solved. <sup>A</sup> picture isn't always the answer—sometimes words do the job better. Make graphics clear and readable. Try them out on real users, not just on your fellow artists or programmers. The most important part of the graphic should be recognized first, then the second most important part, and so on. Use visual cues such as arrows, movement, and the arrangement of elements to direct the eye to the correct place. The symbols used in different kinds of alerts tell the user if the alert is a note, caution, or warning.  
Animation, when used sparingly, is one of the best ways to draw the user's attention to <sup>a</sup> particular place on the screen. For example, users soon learn that the quickest way to find <sup>a</sup> pointer on a busy screen is to move the mouse, making the pointer move on the screen. Animated pointers reassure the user, during a lengthy process such as saving a large document to disk, that the system is alive and well.
