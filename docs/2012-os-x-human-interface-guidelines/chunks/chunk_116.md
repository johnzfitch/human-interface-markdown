A window consists of window-frame areas and a window body. The **window-frame areas** are the title bar and unified toolbar (and, in rare cases, a bottom bar). The **window body** extends from the bottom edge of the title bar (or toolbar, if present) to the bottom edge of the window (not including the bottom bar, if one is present). The window body represents the main **content area** of the window. For example, in a Mail message viewer window, the window body contains the mailbox list, the message list, and the selected message.

The window-frame areas have a light gray gradient surface. OS X provides toolbar controls that are specifically designed to look good on the toolbar. To learn about the controls you can use in a toolbar,see ["Window-Frame](#page-240-0) [Controls"](#page-240-0) (page 241).  
In the window body, content views (such as text or column views) display a white background by default; the surrounding window-body background is usually a shade of light gray.

Every document and app window and panel has, at a minimum:  
- A title bar. Even if a window does not have an actual title (a tools panel, for example), it needs a title bar so that users can move the window.
- A close button, so that users have a consistent way to dismiss the window.  
A standard document window may also have the following additional elements that an app window or panel might not have:  
- Transient horizontal or vertical scroll bars, or both (if not all the window's contents are visible)
- Minimize and zoom buttons
- A proxy icon and a versions menu (after the user has given a document a name and save location for the first time)
- The title of the document
- Transient resize controls  
For example, the TextEdit document window shown here contains a title, a proxy icon, the close, minimize, and zoom buttons, and a scroller. You can't see the resize controls in this window, because they are visible only when the pointer rests above a window edge. Similarly, you can't see the versions menu because the document is not locked (and has not been recently edited) and the pointer is not resting in the title bar to the right of the document title.

The TextEdit window shown above also includes an optional window element called the scope bar. A **scope bar** appears below the toolbar and allows users to narrow down a search operation or to filter objects or other operations by identifying specific sets of characteristics. To learn more about scope bars, see ["Using](#page-186-0) a Scope Bar to Enable [Searching](#page-186-0) and Filtering" (page 187).  
Rarely, a window might display a **bottom bar**, which is a window frame area that extends below the main content area of the window body. A bottom bar contains controls that directly affect the contents and organization of the window, such as the add a buddy and chat controls at the bottom of the iChat window.
