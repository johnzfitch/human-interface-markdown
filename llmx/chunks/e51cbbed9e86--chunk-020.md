Save & Continue saves all changes to the document without closing its window. The appearance of the window, including the current position and selection, remain unchanged.  
Some applications, such as LisaList, save documents at times other than when the user has explicitly saved them from the File/Print menu. If it is necessary for an application to do this, it should warn the user that this is happening.
