<!-- Chunk 182 | Source: 2001 Aqua Human Interface Guidelines (Preliminary).pdf | Est. Tokens: 5519 -->
This chapter describes usage guidelines for terms found in Mac OS X. For ease of use, it contains some terms from the *Apple Publications Style Guide*. For any item that contradicts an *APSG* entry, use the guideline provided here.  
For terms not included here, or for more information, see the *APSG* (http:// developer.apple.com/techpubs/faq.html) and the *American Heritage Dictionary*.  
Apple reserves the right to change terms and guidelines at any time.  
**abbreviations:** Spell out the following on first use (on a page or in a document):  
ISP (Internet service provider) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  
You don't have to spell out *CD-ROM, HTML,* or *MIME*.  
**abort:** Don't use; use **cancel**.  
**Address Book:** Two words. An application, separate from Mail.  
**administrator:** Use to refer to people who can do such tasks as create users and groups, assign privileges to files and folders, and so on. Don't use **Owner**. You can say, for example, "You need to log in with an administrator password" or "Only administrator users can make changes." Don't shorten to "admin user."  
**analog-to-digital (adj.):** Note hyphens.  
**Apple key:** Don't use; we will continue to call the key with the cloverleaf and the Apple logo "the Command key."  
**application:** It is not necessary to say "application program" on first use. (This entry is different from the current APSG.) "Application" is OK to use alone.  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**application menu:** The menu to the right of the Apple menu. Refer to it as "the [application name] application menu" ("the Mail application menu," "the Grab application menu").  
**application names:** Unless the official product name contains an internal cap, twoword application names should contain spaces, even if the filename in the file system appears without a space. Examples of correctly spelled names:  
Address Book  
Disk Utility  
Help Viewer  
Image Capture  
Key Caps  
Keychain Access  
Multiple Users  
NetInfo Manager  
Network Manager  
Print Center  
Process Viewer  
Script Editor  
Setup Assistant  
System Preferences  
TextEdit  
WorldText  
In general, don't use "the" with application names.  
*Correct:* Open QuickTime Player.  
*Incorrect:* Open the QuickTime Player.  
*Correct:* Open Print Center.  
*Correct:* Open the Print Center application.  
*Incorrect:* Open the Print Center.  
**the Applications folder:** There is only one, which is displayed when you click the Applications button in a Finder window.  
**Aqua:** Uppercase (an Apple trademark). Use mainly as an adjective ("the Aqua user interface").  
**attach:** Don't use to mean **connect** (as in "Connect your USB device to your computer").  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**boot:** Don't use for *start up* (except in technical documentation).  
**box:** Don't use "dialog box" anymore; OK to say "dialog."  
**bus-powered, self-powered:** Try to avoid when indicating whether devices draw power from a power cord or from another USB device. When possible, describe the device, don't give it a label: "A device that plugs into an electrical outlet" (instead of "a self-powered device"); "a device that gets its power from another USB device" (instead of "a bus-powered device").  
**button states:** In a dialog, the default button has color and pulses, but avoid references that say "blue"; call it "the default button." Window buttons "have color" or "don't have color"; don't refer to buttons as "clear."  
**canceled/canceling:** Note our style is one "l."  
**Carbon application:** Refers to an application written and compiled using the Carbon API specification interfaces (Universal Interfaces version 3.3.2 or later). Don't say "Carbonized"; instead say something like "update your application for Carbon." The term "Carbon" should be used only in developer documentation.  
A Carbon application executes as a native process in Mac OS X if it is compiled as either a Mach-O or CFM/PEF binary, and can be a single file binary or application package. A Carbon application executes on Mac OS 8.1 to Mac OS 9.x with CarbonLib installed if it is compiled as a CFM-executable binary, as either a singlefile binary or an application package.  
**CD-ROM disc:** Don't shorten to "a CD-ROM." It's either "a CD-ROM disc" or "a CD."  
**chain:** OK to use when you mean a series of USB devices connected together. See **hierarchy**.  
#### **Classic:**  
- 1. A Classic application is one originally created for Mac OS 9 (or earlier) that has not been rewritten for Carbon. More specifically, a Classic application is one written and compiled to the Mac OS Universal Interfaces prior to versions including the Carbon API specification interfaces (version 3.3.1 or earlier). Classic applications are single-file binaries containing both executable code and Resource Manager code components in the Preferred Executable Format (PEF) used by the Code Fragment Manager. In Mac OS X, Classic applications execute in the Classic environment.
- 2. A pane in System Preferences for automatically starting up the Classic environment.  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**the Classic application/Classic environment:** Don't refer to "the Classic application" (Classic.app); instead say, for example, "When you open a Classic application, the Classic environment starts up."  
**Classic Mac OS:** Avoid; instead say "Mac OS 9 and earlier" or whatever is applicable.  
**Clipboard:** The correct term in user documentation; don't use "pasteboard" or "scrap" in user documentation. In developer documentation, it's OK to use "pasteboard" when discussing the NSPasteboard class, but point out that users view the contents of the pasteboard in the Clipboard.  
**close button:** The leftmost (red) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar.  
**Cocoa application:** Refers to an application written and compiled using the Cocoa API frameworks. The term "Cocoa" should be used only in developer documentation.  
Cocoa applications written in Objective-C and C are compiled into Mach-O binaries and application packages, and execute as native processes in Mac OS X. They cannot execute in Mac OS 9.x or earlier. Cocoa applications written in Java execute only in the Mac OS X Java VM environment.  
**column-view button:** The rightmost button in the view control.  
**connect:** Use to refer to the general act of hooking devices together. (Don't use "attach.") You can connect USB devices to a computer; you can connect computers to an Ethernet network. Use "plug in" to refer to the specific action of plugging a connector into a port.  
*Correct:* Connect the USB device to a power source.  
*Correct:* Plug the square end of the USB cable into the USB device.  
**Console:** An application that lets you see technical messages from Mac OS X and Mac OS X applications. Don't say "the Console"; "the Console application" is OK.  
**Darwin:** An operating system that includes some, but not all, of the components of Mac OS X. Darwin comprises the kernel plus the BSD libraries and commands essential to the BSD Commands application environment. "Darwin" is sometimes an appropriate replacement for UNIX. The term "Darwin" doesn't appear in the Mac OS X interface.  
**Date & Time:** A pane in System Preferences.  
**dialog:** Use instead of "dialog box."  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**directory:** In user documentation, don't use directory when you can say folder. Directory Services (in the Print Center) is OK because it is a phone book–type directory.  
**disable:** Avoid in user documentation; say *dimmed* or *turned off* (or simply *off*).  
**disclosure button:** The triangle that reveals more options when clicked (not "the detail button"). You can also call it "the disclosure triangle."  
**Disk First Aid:** Has been replaced by Disk Utility. (But Disk First Aid may be included on the Mac OS X CD, in the Mac OS 9 section.)  
**Disk Utility:** Two words.  
**Dock:** A Finder application. Don't use as a verb. Items are "in the Dock," not "on the Dock."  
*Correct:* Click an icon in the Dock.  
*Correct:* Click the Mail application icon in the Dock.  
*Correct:* Click a minimized window in the Dock.  
*Correct:* To put a window in the Dock, click the minimize button.  
*Correct:* When an item is in the Dock… *Incorrect:* You can dock any window. *Incorrect:* When an item is docked ….  
**drawer:** A pane that slides out when you click a button, such as the Mailbox button in Mail ("the Mailboxes drawer").  
**enable:** Avoid in user documentation; say available or turned on (or simply on) or selected.  
**Favorites:** One of the square buttons in Finder windows.  
**favorites toolbar:** Use to refer to the user-customizable area at the top right of the System Preferences window.  
**filename:** One word. **file server:** Two words. **file sharing:** Two words. **file system:** Two words.  
**FireWire:** Apple's version of high-speed serial data link technology. Can be used as an adjective or a noun. IEEE 1394 is a synonym. Don't use i.LINK.  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**folders:** When referring to folders on a computer used by more than one person, you need to distinguish only the folders that are not accessible to all users. For example, the top-level (global) applications folder is "the Applications folder." An individual user's applications folder is "your Applications folder" or "a person's Applications folder."  
**Grab:** A screen-capture application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**Help Viewer:** Two words.  
**Help Tags:** Use instead of "Tool Tips" to refer to the instructional text that appears when the pointer hovers over an interface element in Mac OS X.  
**hierarchy:** Avoid this term when you mean a series of USB devices connected to one another (and to a computer) in a branching structure using hubs. Simply describe, if possible: "You can connect many USB devices to one computer using a series of hubs," or similar language.  
**home folder:** Always lowercase ("Each user gets his or her own home folder"); there is nothing actually called "the Home folder" (it's named with the user's name).  
**HomePage:** When you're referring to the iTool available at mac.com, it's one word with an internal cap.  
**hot-pluggable:** Try to avoid in user documentation.  
**hub:** FireWire hub or USB hub. See bus-powered, self-powered.  
**icon-view button:** The leftmost button in the view control.  
**IEEE 1394:** Synonym for **FireWire**.  
**i.LINK:** Don't use. Use **FireWire.** i.LINK is Sony's version.  
**Image Capture:** Two words.  
**Info window:** The window that appears when you choose Show Info. Instances of "Inspector" in the interface should be replaced with "Info." See Inspector.  
**Inspector:** This term will be removed from the interface and replaced with "Info." Examples:  
*Show Info* (menu command)  
*Info: Applications* (title of the window that appears when you select the Applications folder and choose Show Info)  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
*Image Info* (title of the window that appears when you choose Info from the Edit menu in Grab)  
**Internet service provider (ISP):** Spell out the first time this term appears on a help page or in a document. After that, it's OK to use the acronym.  
**Keychain Access:** The application name is two words. You use the application to create keychains (lowercase).  
**Language:** One of the tabs in the International pane of System Preferences.  
**log in (v.):** You log in to a computer or server (not log on). You log out, not off.  
**login items:** Items that open when you log in. In user documentation, it's preferable to use descriptive language (for example, "items that start up automatically") instead of this term.  
**Login Items:** One of the tabs in the Login pane of System Preferences.  
**login screen:** The dialog that appears when a new user logs in to Mac OS X.  
**Mac:** Avoid when referring generally to a Macintosh computer (it could be confused with more specific names such as "Power Mac" or "iMac"). Use "computer." You can, however, use "Mac" judiciously as an adjective ("the Mac desktop").  
**Mac Help:** The help "book" for the Mac OS and hardware. The help system itself is Apple Help, but you shouldn't have to use that term in user documentation.  
**Mac OS Extended, Mac OS Standard:** Disk formats.  
**Mac OS 9:** Always use the full name; don't shorten to "OS 9" or "9." Note spacing between each "word." Don't say "Mac OS 8/9"; instead say "Mac OS 8 and 9."  
**Mac OS X:** Always say "Mac OS X"; don't shorten to "OS X" or "X." Note spacing.  
**Mail:** An application that comes with Mac OS X. Address Book is a separate application.  
**mailbox:** One word. In Mail, folders contain mailboxes and mailboxes contain messages (received email).  
**Mailbox:** The button you click in the Mail application to see the Mailboxes drawer (which slides out on the left or right).  
**Mailboxes drawer:** In the Mail application, when you click the Mailbox button, the Mailboxes drawer slides out. It displays your mailboxes.  
Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**mailbox window:** The main Mail window. Not capped because the window doesn't have a title.  
**mass storage (adj.):** No hyphen (as in "mass storage device").  
**maximize:** Don't use. Instead, say something like, "To make an item in the Dock active, click it."  
**menu bar:** Two words.  
**MIME format:** An email format (as opposed to plain text format). You don't have to spell it out.  
**minimize button:** The middle (yellow) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar. You click this button to put a window in the Dock.  
**minimized:** OK to use to describe a window in the Dock:  
When you click the minimize button, the window goes in the Dock.  
Windows in the Dock are minimized.  
**Mouse:** A pane in System Preferences.  
**Multiple Users:** Two words, capped. An application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**name server:** Two words.  
**Network:** A pane in System Preferences, and an icon you see when you click the Computer button in a Finder window.  
**network time server:** Not capped, but "Network Time" (the tab in the Date & Time pane of System Preferences) is. So is Network Time Synchronization.  
**non-USB devices:** Use to refer to devices that don't use USB.  
**Owner:** Don't use. See **administrator**.  
**pane:** Use to refer to different views within a window (views that can be changed with a tab, a pop-up menu, a button, or by selecting an item, or views that change automatically, as in Installer). In most cases in user documentation, you can avoid using "pane" by describing how to get to a particular place: "Click System Preferences, click Network, click AppleTalk. . . ."  
Examples of how to use "pane":  
Type your name in the Login Window pane of Login preferences.  
Choose an item from the Configure pop-up menu in the TCP/IP pane of Network preferences.  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
You can see installed localized resources in the Show Application Files pane of the Info window.  
When you click Network in System Preferences, the TCP/IP pane appears. To display the Services pane, click the Services tab.  
Click the Workgroups tab, then click the Options tab and select "Check for email when members log in."  
You choose a workgroup storage volume and set options for the volume in the Volumes pane of the Workgroups pane.  
Make sure "Play audio CDs" is selected in the "Group members may" section of the Privileges pane of the Workgroups pane.  
You can specify an RGB default in the "Default Profiles for Documents" pane of the Profiles pane of ColorSync preferences.  
Note that each of the system preferences panes can be shortened to, for example, "Network preferences." See also preferences.  
**panel:** Don't use; see **pane**.  
**Password:** A pane in System Preferences.  
**pasteboard:** Don't use in user documentation. OK to use in developer documentation that discusses the NSPasteboard class, but point out that users view the contents of the pasteboard in the Clipboard.  
**pathname:** Most user documentation does not need to refer to specific pathnames ("TextEdit is in the Applications folder on your hard disk"). But when necessary if a user has to type a pathname in a dialog, for example—you can refer to it as "the path" or "the pathname."  
**plug in (v.):** Use only when referring to the specific act of plugging a connector into a port or outlet. For example, a power cord plugs into an electrical outlet; you can plug a USB connector into a USB port. See **connect.**  
**preferences:** Mac OS X has two types of preferences:  
- System Preferences: The general preferences application (the one with an icon in the default Dock).
- Application Preferences: Use the application name, capped ("Mail Preferences").  
It's OK to call the things you set in preferences "settings" ("You can change settings with System Preferences").  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
*Correct:* Click System Preferences (in the Dock) and click Sound.  
*Correct:* Use the Sound pane of System Preferences to choose an alert sound.  
*Correct:* Open System Preferences, click Network, and click the Connections tab.  
*Correct:* In Mail Preferences, click Accounts.  
You can shorten the name of each of the system preferences "modules" to "<Name> preferences," as in "Startup Disk preferences."  
**Preview:** An application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**Print Center:** Two words, capped. Because it's an application, it's correct to say "Open Print Center" (not "the Print Center").  
**resize control:** The area in the lower-right corner of a window that you drag to resize the window.  
**screen shot:** Two words. Don't use "screen dump."  
**scroll bar:** The whole control is "the scroll bar"; the former "scroll box" is the "scroller." Note that "scroll bar" is two words.  
**scroll box:** Call what used to be called the "scroll box" the scroller (in Aqua it's no longer a box).  
**Setup Assistant:** The application you use to set up your computer. Don't call it "the Mac OS Setup Assistant."  
**sheet:** Refers to a modal dialog attached to a specific document window (when you choose Print, the Print sheet appears). In user documentation, call them "dialogs" ("sheet" is mainly for marketing and developer purposes).  
**Sherlock:** You don't have to say "Sherlock 2."  
**Sketch:** A drawing application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**slider:** The widget you drag to set a value on a continuum (a range of values). The whole control is called "the slider control."  
**Startup Disk:** A pane in System Preferences (not "System Disk"). If you need to distinguish between the Mac OS 9 version and the Mac OS X version, you can refer to them as "the Startup Disk pane of Mac OS X System Preferences" and "the Classic Startup Disk control panel" or "the Startup Disk control panel included with Mac OS 9."  
**startup items:** Items that open when you log in. In user documentation, it's preferable to use descriptive language (for example, "items that start up automatically") instead of this term.  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**system:** Usually "computer" is preferable to "system," as in "The computer requires a folder named 'Applications' in this location."  
**System Preferences:** The user-modifiable set of preferences at the top is the "preferences toolbar." When you click a preferences button, the "[button name] pane" appears (for example, "the Network pane"). See also **preferences**.  
**tab:** In a dialog, the tab itself is called the "<tabname> tab," but the content you see when you click a tab is the "pane." Don't say "under the <tabname> tab." Examples:  
You can specify your home page in the Web pane of Internet preferences.  
To set up automatic login, click Login, then click the Login Window tab.  
You disconnect from the network time server in the Network Time pane of Date & Time preferences.  
**Terminal:** An application for using the command-line interface. Don't say "the Terminal"; "the Terminal application" is OK.  
**TextEdit:** One word with an internal cap. A word-processing application that comes with Mac OS X.  
**toolbar:** An area containing buttons, such as in Finder windows and the Mail application. Don't call them "shortcuts."  
**Tool Tips:** Don't use. Use **Help Tags**.  
**Type A connector:** A type of USB connector. Use once and describe what it looks like ("rectangular").  
**Type B connector:** A type of USB connector. Use once and describe what it looks like ("square").  
**UNIX:** Don't use when referring to the Mac OS X architecture. The correct term to use instead depends on the context. Darwin ("With the Terminal application, you can enter Darwin system commands") and "BSD utilities" are possible alternatives.  
**UNIX File System:** One of the file formats available in Disk Utility.  
**USB:** Abbreviation for "Universal Serial Bus." Provide spelled-out term only once, on the USB overview page; otherwise, use simply "USB."  
**USB adapter:** Use to refer to a device that lets you connect non-USB devices to USB ports.  
**user name:** Two words.  
#### **APPENDIX B**  
#### Mac OS X Terminology Guidelines  
**vCard:** One word with an internal cap. The virtual cards you can create in Address Book.  
**view control:** The three-button unit you use to change your view of Finder windows. The view control comprises the icon-view button, the list-view button, and the column-view button.  
#### **window controls:**  
the close button the minimize button the zoom button the resize control  
**workspace:** Don't use as a synonym for desktop or Finder.  
**WorldText:** An application; one word with an internal cap.  
**zoom button:** The rightmost (green) button of the three window controls at the left of the title bar. Clicking this button toggles between the standard window size and the user-resized size.
