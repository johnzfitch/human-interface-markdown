Mission Control gives users an easy way to see all their desktops and full-screen windows, in addition to Dashboard and the Dock, at one time. In Mission Control, users can create a new desktop, switch between desktops and full-screen windows, or choose a specific window on the current desktop.

In System Preferences, users can set how they want to enter Mission Control,such as with a couple of keystrokes, a gesture, a hot corner, or all three.  
Apps don't influence the way Mission Control displays the user's desktops and full-screen windows, but apps need to ensure that users can enter Mission Control whenever they want.  
**Respect the "enter Mission Control" gesture.** No matter which gesture users choose for this action, you need to ensure that it works all the time, regardless of what your app is doing.
