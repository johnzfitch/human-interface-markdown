The computer should be accessible to everyone who chooses to use it. There are likely to be members of your target audience who are different from the "average" user that you envision. Users will undoubtedly vary in their ages, styles, and abilities. They may also have physical or cognitive limitations, linguistic differences, or other differences you need to consider. Identify how the individuals in your target audience differ and what special needs they may have.  
Make it easy for users to interact with your product using different input devices and output devices. If you develop specialized hardware and software for people with physical limitations, work with application developers so that your products are supported by their software.  
Make your application accessible to people around the world by including support for worldwide capabilities in your designs from the beginning of your development process. Take stock of the cultural and linguistic needs and expectations of your target audiences. For more information, see the section "Worldwide Compatibility" beginning on page 16 in Chapter 2, "General Design Considerations."  
More information about universal access appears throughout the book where appropriate. For specific information, see the section "Universal Access" beginning on page 24 in Chapter 2, "General Design Considerations."

<span id="page-39-0"></span>This chapter discusses several areas to consider as you begin your development process. These considerations cover three broad areas:  
- worldwide compatibility—support for multiple script systems and multicultural sensitivity to your target audience
- universal access—provisions for people with disabilities to use your software by means of alternative input devices or output devices
- collaborative computing—support for people working in groups on local networks or people using computers over remote networks  
If you are aware of the factors that influence worldwide compatibility, universal access, and collaborative computing, you can plan ahead. By incorporating support for these capabilities from the beginning of your development process, you can save time, money, and development problems and end up with a product that is immediately useful to a wide range of people.
