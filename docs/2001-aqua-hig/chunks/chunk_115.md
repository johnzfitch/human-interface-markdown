When a user attempts to quit a document-based application and there is only one document with unsaved changes open, present a Save Before Quitting alert (such as the one shown in Figure 6-9 (page 108)) as a sheet attached to the unsaved document, perform the actions described in "The Minimal Save Dialog" (page 102), and then quit the application as appropriate.  
Note that the Don't Save button, which can result in data loss, is positioned away from the "safe" buttons (Cancel and Save). The keyboard combination Command-D should be implemented for the Don't Save button.
