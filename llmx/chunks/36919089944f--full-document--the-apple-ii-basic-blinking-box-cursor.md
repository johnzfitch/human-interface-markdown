# The (Apple II BASIC) Blinking-box Cursor

| Computer    | Move left  | Move right | Insert | Delete | Accept | Cancel    |
|-------------|------------|------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Apple II's  | LEFT ARROW | RIGHTARROW | *      | *      | RETURN | CONTROL-X |
| Apple III's | LEFTARROW  | RIGHTARROW | *      | *      | RETURN | CONTROL-X |

<sup>\*</sup> A user can both insert and delete within a BASIC input line using ESCAPE - cursor keys. As a practical matter, however, few other than experienced BASIC programmers can actually do so with any facility, as the screen ceases to reflect what the character-input buffer is actually holding.
