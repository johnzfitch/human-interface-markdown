<span id="page-75-8"></span>Mac OS X includes an advanced printing system. Because of all the optionsthissystem provides, it isimportant that you use the standard printing dialogs so that users understand the options that are available to them without getting lost in features. The printing architecture allows users to print "digital paper" documents that can be sent to a printer, faxed, or saved as a PDF file (Figure 6-8). These features are all available automatically when you use the Mac OS X printing system in your application.
