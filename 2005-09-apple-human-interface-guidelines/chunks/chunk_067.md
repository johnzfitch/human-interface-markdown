Clicking an application icon in the Dock should always result in a window becoming active.  
- <span id="page-55-7"></span>■ If the application is not open, a new window should open. In a document-based application, the application should open a new, untitled window. In an application that is not document-based, the main application window should open.
- When a user clicks an open application's icon in the Dock, the application becomes active and all open unminimized windows are brought to the front; minimized document windows remain in the Dock. If there are no unminimized windows when the user clicks the Dock icon, the last minimizedwindowshould be expanded and made active. If nowindows are open, the application should open a newwindow—a newuntitledwindowfor document-based applications, otherwise the main application window.  
#### The Mac OS X Environment  
Control-clicking an application icon in the Dock displays a menu that allows users to perform tasks such as quitting the application, hiding it, or showing its location in the file system. (Users can also press the application icon to get this menu.) You can modify this menu to make features of your application available from your Docktile. See "Dock [Menus"](#page-165-0) (page 166) for more information on Dock menus.
