As much as possible, allow people to do whatever they want at all times. Avoid using modes that lock the user into one operation and don't allow the user to work on anything else until that operation is completed.  
Most acceptable uses of modes fall into one of the following categories:  
- Short-term modes in which the user must constantly do something to maintain the mode. Examples are holding down the mouse button to scroll text or holding down the Shift key to extend a text selection.
- Alert modes, in which the user must rectify an unusual situation before proceeding. Keep these modes to a minimum. See ["Types of Dialogs and When](#page-94-1)  [to Use Them" \(page 95\)](#page-94-1) for more information.  
Other modes are acceptable if they do one of the following:  
- They emulate a familiar real-life situation that is itself modal. For example, choosing different tools in a graphics application resembles the real-life choice of physical drawing tools.
- They change only the attributes of something, not its behavior. The boldface and underline modes of text entry are examples.
- They block most other normal operation of the system to emphasize the modality. An example is a dialog that makes all menu commands unavailable except Cut, Copy, and Paste.  
If an application uses modes, there must be a clear visual indicator of the current mode, and it should be very easy for users to get in and out of the mode. For example, in many graphics applications, the pointer can look like a pencil, a cross, a paintbrush, or an eraser, depending on the function (the mode) the user selects.
