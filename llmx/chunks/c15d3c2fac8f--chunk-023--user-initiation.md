#### User Initiation  
Programmers are often tempted to take care of many details for the user, keeping the user unaware of much that is going on, and often completing actions on the user's behalf. The concept of user control does not allow this. Though the user doesn't need to know all about the code or the functioning of the hardware, the user does require a functional description. The user makes decisions, not the system. This concept is also pragmatic, given the general approach of programming for this environment: because the user, at any given moment, is selecting from a wide range of actions, it is usually not possible for the system to determine just what is "best" for the user.
