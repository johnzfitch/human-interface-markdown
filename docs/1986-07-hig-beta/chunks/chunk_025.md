Good design must communicate, not just dazzle. It must inform, not just impress.  
Clear communication is the real point of graphic design. Graphic design is utilized in things we see every day—from billboards to business cards to books. In the desktop interface, everything the user sees and manipulates on the screen is a graphic of some sort. As much as possible, all commands, features, and parameters of an application, and all the user's data, appear as graphic objects on the screen.  
These graphics are not merely cosmetic. When they are clear and consistent, they contribute greatly to ease of learning, communication, and understanding. In order for the graphic to be successful in the interface, there must be a balance between the creativity of the graphics and the user's satisfaction and success in understanding the interface.  
All user interface graphics should be designed with the medium of the computer screen in mind. Computer screens are of a particular size, aspect ratio, and bit depth. A 512K Macintosh has an aspect ratio that produces approximately square pixels that are either black or white. An Apple II doesn't have a square aspect ratio, nor is it black and white. If you design your icons and graphics on the target screen, rather than on paper, you will take advantage of whatever that screen has to offer and have the best design possible.
