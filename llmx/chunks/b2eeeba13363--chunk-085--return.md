#### Return  
The Return key is another signal to proceed, but it defines a different type of motion than Tab. Pressing Return signals movement to the leftmost field one step lower on the display (like a carriage return on a typewriter). Return (like Tab) can cause an Enter operation before the Return operation. Return (like Enter) can be used to dismiss dialog and alert boxes.  
While the user is entering text into a text document (but not necessarily into a spreadsheet document, etc.), pressing Tab moves the insertion point to the next tab stop, pressing Return moves it to the beginning of the next line, and pressing Enter is ignored.
