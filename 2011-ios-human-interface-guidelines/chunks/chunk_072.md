When possible, minimize the number of times people must be in a modal environment to perform a task or supply a response. iOS applications should allow people to interact with them in nonlinear ways. Modality prevents this freedom by interrupting people's workflow and forcing them to choose a particular path.  
Modality is most appropriate when:  
- It's critical to get the user's attention.
- A task must be completed (or explicitly abandoned) to avoid leaving the user's data in an ambiguous state.  
People appreciate being able to accomplish a self-contained subtask in a modal view, because the context shift is clear and temporary. But if the subtask is too complex, people can lose sight of the main task they suspended when they entered the modal view. This risk increases when the modal view is full screen and when it includes multiple subordinate views or states.  
**Keep modal tasks fairly short and narrowly focused**. You don't want your users to experience a modal view as a mini application within your application. Be especially wary of creating a modal task that involves a hierarchy of views, because people can get lost and forget how to retrace their steps. If a modal task must contain subtasks in separate views, be sure to give users a single, clear path through the hierarchy, and avoid circularities.  
**Always provide an obvious and safe way to exit a modal task**. People should always be able to predict the fate of their work when they dismiss a modal view.  
**If the task requires a hierarchy of modal views**, make sure your users understand what happens if they tap a Done button in a view that's below the top level. Examine the task to decide whether a Done button in a lower-level view should finish only that view's part of the task or the entire task. When possible, avoid adding Done buttons to subordinate views, because of this potential for confusion.
