<span id="page-135-4"></span>Hardware icons represent devices as you most often see them: on your desk.

To help users distinguish between external devices, their icons provide a region for an identifying symbol (FireWire, SCSI, and so on).  
Removable media such as CDs, floppy disks, and PC cards are depicted the way they look when you hold them in front of you—that is, the perspective is straight-on.
