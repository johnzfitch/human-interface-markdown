You can provide custom icons for your application and its associated documents and files. If you don't provide custom icons, the Finder displays default icons in most cases. There are no default icons provided for preferences files or control panels, so you must provide icons for these.  
Since there are so many icons that users see and deal with, it's important to create consistent sets of icons. Users should be able to easily identify and locate the icons they're looking for, which is more possible if related icons look related. Each icon family consists of the same icon in two sizes and three bit depths. Each type of icon family needs to look like a class of objects. For example, all document-related icons should look like documents. The entire group of icons that belongs to your product, called a suite of icons, should have a common appearance that identifies all the icons as being related to your product.
