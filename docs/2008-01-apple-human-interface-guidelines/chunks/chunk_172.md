Mac OS X v10.5 and later provides a handful of free-standing images that can be used as borderless buttons. These images do not require further processing by an NSButtonCell object.  
Two of the free-standing images are standalone versions of similar template images. To see why you might need both versions of such an image, consider how Safari offers stop-progress functionality to users. In the Downloads window, Safari uses the free-standing  
NSImageNameStopProgressFreestandingTemplate image inline with a progress indicator to allow users to stop an in-progress download. (Figure 11-28 shows this control in the Safari Downloads window.) Because this window can display several separate download processes at the same time, it's important to display a stop-progress control for each individual process. Contrast this with the NSImageNameStopProgressTemplate image (shown in [Table](#page-155-1) 11-1 (page 156)) that Safari uses in a toolbar button. Here, the process users might want to stop is the downloading of a webpage in the main Safari window, so it makes sense to offer this functionality in a toolbar button.
