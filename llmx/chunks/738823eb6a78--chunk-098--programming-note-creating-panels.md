#### **Programming Note: Creating Panels**  
The Application Kit contains several ready-made ordinary and attention panels that you can use, as well as functions that let you easily create basic attention panels. You can also create custom panels-either ordinary panels or more complex attention panels. If you create a custom attention panel, you are responsible for making sure that the panel looks like an attention panel. (Similarly, custom ordinary panels should look like ordinary panels, and not like attention panels.)
