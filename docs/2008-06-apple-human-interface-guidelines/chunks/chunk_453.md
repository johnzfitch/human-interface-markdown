**Control sizes**: Tab views are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. The tab height is fixed for each size, but you control the size of the pane area. The tab heights for each size are listed below:  
■ Regular size: 20 pixels.  
■ Small: 17 pixels.  
■ Mini: 15 pixels.  
**Label spacing and fonts**: The tab labels should be in a font that's proportional to the size of the tab view control. In addition, the label should be placed so that there are equal margins of space before and after it. The guidelines below provide the specifications you should use for tab labels:  
- Regular size: System font. Center in tab, leaving 12 pixels on each side.
- Small: Small system font. Center in tab, leaving 10 pixels on each side.
- Mini: Mini system font. Center in tab, leaving 8 pixels on each side.  
**Control spacing**: Whether you decide to inset a tab view in a window or extend its edges to the window sides and bottom, you should place the top edge of the tab view 12 or 14 pixels below the bottom edge of the title bar (or toolbar, if there is one). If you choose to inset a tab view in a window, you should leave a margin of 20 pixels between the sides and bottom of the tab view and the sides and bottom of the window (although 16 pixels is also an acceptable margin-width). If you need to provide controls below the tab view, leave enough space below the tab view so the controls are 20 pixels above the bottom edge of the window and 12 pixels between the tab view and the controls. Figure 15-85 shows how an inset tab view should look.

<span id="page-330-1"></span>If you choose to extend the tab view sides and bottom so that they meet the window sides and bottom, you should leave a margin of at least 20 pixels between the content in the tab view and the tab-view edges. Figure 15-86 shows how this should look.

If you need to use a pop-up menu at the top of a group box (because, for example, you have too many tabs to fit in the window), be sure to center the control along the top of the group box, as shown in Figure 15-87:
