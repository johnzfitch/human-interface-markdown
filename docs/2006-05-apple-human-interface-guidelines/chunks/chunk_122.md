Modifier keys alter the way other keystrokes or mouse clicks are interpreted. You should use these keys—Shift, Caps Lock, Option, Command, and Control—consistently as described here.  
#### <span id="page-92-7"></span>**Shift**  
When pressed at the same time as a character key, the Shift key produces the uppercase alphabetic letter or the upper symbol on the key.  
The Shift key is also used with the mouse for extending a selection or for constraining movements in graphics applications. For example, in some applications pressing Shift while using a rectangle tool draws squares.  
#### <span id="page-92-0"></span>**Caps Lock**  
When activated, the Caps Lock key has the same effect on alphabetic keys as the Shift key, but it has no effect on nonalphabetic keys. When the Caps Lock key is down, the user must press Shift to type the upper character on a nonalphabetic key.  
#### <span id="page-92-6"></span>**Option**  
When used with other keys, the Option key produces special symbols. The Keyboard Viewer, which users can add to the Input menu in the International pane of System Preferences, shows which keys generate each symbol.  
<span id="page-92-1"></span>The Option key can also be used with the mouse to modify the effect of a click or drag. For example, in some applications pressing Option while dragging an object makes a copy of the object.
