## Displaying the Current State of Data

When many people work on the same data, it must be clear to everyone what is happening at all times. Because some data may be visible to more than one person at a time but editable by only one person, you need to provide a visual clue about the current state of the data. (Make sure that the visual clue is accessible to users with a visual disability, particularly if they require the aid of some kind of special device or software.) The current state of the data may vary from moment to moment or from session to session. If one person is editing the data, other people should not be able to edit it at the same time. It is very important to make clear to all users which information they may change and which they may not. If you can provide more information to users about why some information is presently unavailable for change, it will save them from wasting time trying to change unavailable information, for example.

When there is a change to data that is visible to more than one user at a time, display the change immediately. For example, on an AppleShare volume several people may have windows open that display the contents of the volume. If one user creates a document on the volume, its icon appears immediately in all the open windows on the volume. Such feedback is very important to people who are working cooperatively.
