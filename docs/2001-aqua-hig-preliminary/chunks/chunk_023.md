<span id="page-30-5"></span>Aesthetic integrity means that information is well organized and consistent with principles of visual design. Your product should look pleasant on screen even when viewed for a long time.  
Keep graphics simple, and use them only when they truly enhance usability. Don't overload the user with icons or put dozens of buttons in windows or dialogs. Don't use arbitrary symbols to represent concepts; they may serve to confuse or distract users.  
Match a graphic element with users' expectations of its behavior. Don't change the meaning or behavior of standard items. For example, don't use checkboxes sometimes for multiple choices and other times for exclusive choices.
