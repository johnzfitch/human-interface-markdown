#### Mouse-ahead

Mouse-ahead (analogous to the keyboard's typeahead) saves, in a memory buffer, any mouse actions the user performs when the application isn't ready to process them. If appropriate, the application can then carry out these stored processes when it has time. Alternatively, the application can choose to ignore saved-up mouse actions, but should do so only to protect the user from possibly damaging consequences.
