Like small controls, mini controls have specific spacing guidelines. In addition to the spacing guidelines in ["Controls"](#page-224-0) (page 225) the following guidelines are illustrated in Figure 15-17:  
- Side borders should be 10 pixels.
- Bottom borders should be 12 pixels.
- Groups of controls should be separated by at least 8 pixels.  
In Figure 15-17, note that as with small controls, the buttons in the toolbar are big enough to accommodate 16 x 16 icons. Note also the use of separators within the tab view instead of group boxes or white space; they allow for an more compact window. More examples of using separators are illustrated in ["Grouping Controls"](#page-297-0) (page 298).
