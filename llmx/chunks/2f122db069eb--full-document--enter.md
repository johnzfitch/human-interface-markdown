#### Enter

The Enter key tells the application that the user is through entering information in a particular area of the document, such as a field in an array or table. Most applications add information to a document as soon as the user types or draws it. However, the application may need to wait until a whole collection of information is available before processing it. In this case, the user presses the Enter key to signal that the information is complete. The user can press Enter (like Return) to dismiss dialog boxes and alert boxes, if there is a default button. While the user is entering text into a *text* document, pressing Enter has no effect.
