Be very cautious about creating new interface elements because you may introduce unnecessary complexity. You will have to work extremely hard to make sure that any newly introduced elements fit in with those provided by Cocoa and Carbon. Additionally, as the Aqua user interface continues to evolve, your custom elements will require updating to adapt to changes in Aqua.  
Before implementing a new interface element, *make sure* that you can't use existing elements or a combination of them to achieve the desired result. Usability testing is essential for determining whether a new element works.
