<span id="page-97-3"></span>Double-clicking involves a second click that follows immediately after the first click. If the two clicks are close enough to each other in terms of time (as set by the user in Keyboard & Mouse preferences) and location (usually within a couple of points), they constitute a double click.  
Double-clickingis most commonly used as a shortcut for other actions, such as pressing Command-O to open a document or dragging to select a word. Because not everyone is physically able to perform a double click, it should *never* be the only way to perform an action.  
Some applications support triple-clicking. For example, in a word processor, the first click sets the insertion point, the second clickselects thewholeword, and the third clickselects thewhole sentence or paragraph. Supporting more than three clicks is inadvisable.
