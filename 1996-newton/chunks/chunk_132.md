Like a picker, a **scrolling list** is a list of items from which a user selects a field value. A scrolling list does not usually show its whole list of items at once, but a user can see items that aren't currently visible by scrolling the list with local scroll arrows. A user can also scroll by tapping and dragging the pen either above or below the list. [Figure 6-3](#page-172-0) shows examples of a scrolling list with local scroll arrows.  
A user can select a listed item by tapping it, and an application may allow a user to select multiple items by tapping each item in turn. If a scrolling list includes a checkbox next to each item, then each selected item has a check mark in its checkbox. If a scrolling list does not include checkboxes, then the selected items are highlighted. Tapping a selected item deselects it. Users don't have to select anything in a list. They can just scroll through a list to peruse its contents.  
A scrolling list has a thin black rectangular border with square corners. It can be any size that fits the view that contains it.

If a scrolling list uses local scroll arrows, they should only appear when the list is long enough to require scrolling. Use conventional black and white scroll arrows like those used in a Find slip when the Where option is set to Selected (see ["Local Scroll Arrows" on page 2-39\)](#page-82-0).  
Each time a scrolling list appears, it may list the same items or different items. An application can modify a scrolling list in response to user input or changes in the application's environment.  
Some scrolling lists may need to accommodate items whose text is too long to fit the list. When this is the case, your application should eliminate text in the middle of a long item and insert an ellipsis (…) there, preserving the beginning and ending of the item. Text items may be the same at the beginning and middle, so if you cut off the end of the text item, users lose that context and must guess which of the several item names that begin the same is the desired one. Although an ellipsis is preferable in the middle of a long item, an application may simply truncate the item and suffix an ellipsis.

Since the full range isn't visible all at once in a scrolling list, users have a hard time understanding the scope of their choices. Pickers work well for listing discontinuous values across a range, such as 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and Never. Sliders work very well for displaying a continuous range of values and for letting users choose any value in the range.
