<!-- Chunk 24 | Source: 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 174 -->
This section presents a set of principles useful for designing products for Macintosh computers. The reason for defining a set of design principles is to help you build a product that meets the standards of the Macintosh computer. Also, these principles can help clarify what you can do in order to design a product based on what is known about people and how they operate in the world.  
You'll undoubtedly find out that you can't design in accordance with all of the principles all of the time. In that type of situation, you'll have to make a decision based on which principle or set of principles is most important in the context of the task you're solving.
