In order to properly address the needs of the users, you must first know who they are and what their needs are. Software design should begin with a user-profile study. This study should cover the following three phases:  
- 1. Select the target audience. Begin your human interface design by identifying your target audience. Are you writing for businesspeople or children? Will your audience consist of people relaxing at home or accountants under severe time constraints?
- Ascertain the level and limitations of their pre-existing knowledge.
You should have an understanding of how much the target users know about:
- A. using the Apple computer
- B. the general subject matter your program deals with.
- 3. Identify their needs. Once you have an understanding of the knowledge and limitations of the users, you can then figure out what types of information and level of support the the program will have to supply.  
Figures 1 and 2 are mythical examples of two possible user-profiles for programs that fill the exact same function: tax planning. Even though the task performed, the formulas used, the raw data required are identical, the programs that would result from the two user-profiles might bear little external resemblance.  
The "research" quoted in the examples is ficticious—do not start writing a tax planner based on it. (The "case histories" in this document are real; the samples of display and document designs are fictitious.)  
Carrying out an early investigation such as the ones above requires a minimum of time and can save you man-months of work later on. The reports need not be works of art; it is only important that every member of the design team have a clear picture of who the audience for this product will be.  
Make sure you consider all your users:  
In a data-base program recently developed for a computer with large mass storage, no effort was spared in making every section of the program as "friendly" as possible. When a particular task proved somewhat difficult to learn or use, the task was reduced by picking up bits and pieces of it within other tasks. The program slowly drifted toward being consistently somewhat difficult to learn and use.

Professional Tax Planner User Profile Study July 17, 1983  
User: CPA or Public Accountant  
Anticipated knowledge of Apple computers: none. (The accountant may well have purchased the system just because of our program.)  
Assumed knowledge of subject matter: Expert  
#### Needs:  
- Staged learning curve. Must feel comfortable in a minimum time. Extended features can be picked up later.
- Facility. Must be able to create and edit scenarios quickly.
- 3. Clear instructions and error messages. User may have never touched a computer before. Help should be aimed toward problems in the use of the system, rather than explanations of the difference between Short-term and Long-term capital gains.
- 4. Professional appearance. Accountants will be using this package not only to help their clients, but to impress them. The vocabulary used on the display and in printed reports should be serious and professional. It may contain accounting jargon in areas that will not cause confusion to clients. The accountant must be protected against embarrassing errors (and error messages); he may have a client sitting beside him.
- 5. Supplementary Features: accountants surveyed currently add or subtract amounts from the "accurate" figures produced by tax planners. Such items as a rough estimate of state tax liability may need to be figured into reports. Provide this facility.
- 6. Accountants are habitual users of adding machines: they may be expected to do all intermediate calculations on their own adder. No calculator function need be provided.

Personal Tax Planner User Profile Study December 21, 1982  
User: John O. Middle to Upper-income Public  
Anticipated knowledge of Apple computers: owner with some experience. (Research indicates that tax planning programs do not stimulate an initial computer purchase: people who already own the computer are buying the packages.)  
Assumed knowledge of subject matter: None  
#### Needs:  
- 1. The prompting and documentation need to be tutorial: the user must be guided into finding the necessary information to enter into the program, carrying out the kind of explorations with the program that will be most beneficial, and then suggest where the user should go from here.
- Clear content verification and error messages.
"Unlikely" data should be confirmed by user. Help
should be aimed toward problems in understanding the
subject of taxes.
- 3. Appearance and use of accounting jargon. Non-professionals will be using this package. The vocabulary used on the display and in printed reports should be non-intimidating and not filled with accounting jargon.
- 4. User will probably use the program only a few times per year. There must be a minimum learning curve, even at the expense of reduced power and facility. A menu-driven format should certainly be considered as a first cut.
- 5. The user has to be asked for a lot of pre-computed figures: use an expression-evaluator input to allow them to add, subtract, multiply, and divide during input.  
The designers had never considered who their audience was beyond their being "office workers," but when problems showed up during testing, they sat down and did a user profile. What they found was that there would be three separate users of the system:  
- The data-entry persons. These folk would be proficient typists who initially would be expected to enter a great deal of pre-existing information. They might be temporary help, or they might be people who normally performed a different job. Their needs were for an interface that is quick to learn and easy to use.
- 2. The decision makers. These people would be expected to draw information from the system, both by calling up data on the display and by generating reports. They could be expected to be habitual users of the system: they could handle a long but gentle learning curve that would give them progressively more power.
- The key operators. These people are the ones who, in real life, read
the manuals. They can be expected to spend some time with the
system initially and can be expected to learn how to perform the
more technical operation and maintenance tasks of the system.  
Once the users of the system were identified, once their individual needs were identified, the designers were able to "unbalance" their equally-difficult interface, so that each user had a level of difficulty consistent with their skills and the amount of time they could spend learning the system.
