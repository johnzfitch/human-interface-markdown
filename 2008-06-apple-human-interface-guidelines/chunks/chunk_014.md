This document is the primary user interface documentation for Mac OS X. It provides specific details about designing for Aqua compliance in Mac OS X version 10.5, although some of the information may apply to previous versions of Mac OS X.  
Aqua is the overall appearance and behavior of Mac OS X. Aqua defines the standard appearance of specific user interface componentssuch as windows, menus, and controls, and is also characterized by the anti-aliased appearance of text and graphics,shadowing, transparency, and careful use of color. Aqua deliversstandardized consistent behaviors and promotes clear communication of status through animated notifications, visual effects, and more. Designing for Aqua compliance will ensure you provide the best possible user experience for your customers.  
Introduction to Apple Human Interface Guidelines  
<span id="page-19-0"></span>Aqua is available to Cocoa, Carbon, and Java software. For Cocoa and Carbon application development, Interface Builder is the best way to begin building an Aqua-compliant graphical user interface. If you are porting an existing Mac OS 9 application to Mac OS X, see the *Carbon Porting Guide*. Java developers can use the Swing toolkit, which includes an Aqua look and feel in Mac OS X.
