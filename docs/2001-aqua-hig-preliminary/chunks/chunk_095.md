<span id="page-112-4"></span>A **disclosure triangle** allows the display, or "disclosure," of information that elaborates on the primary information in a window. Disclosure triangles are commonly used in the Finder's list view, where clicking a triangle displays a folder's contents.

Disclosure triangles are available to Carbon developers through the Control Manager (CreateDisclosureTriangle) or the Appearance Manager (DrawThemeButton).  
Another common implementation of disclosure triangles is providing a way for users to expand a dialog. The Aqua Save dialog, for example, has a collapsed and an expanded state.
