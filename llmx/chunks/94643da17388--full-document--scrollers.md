#### **Scrollers**

Scrollers are used to control what's displayed within a window or panel, or within a rectangular subsection of a window or panel. When the material to be displayed is larger than the opening available to display it, the user must scroll unseen portions into the opening in order to view them. The figure below shows, diagrammatically, a scrollable document, the area available to view it, and the scrollers that can move the opening around on the surface of the document.
