## **Basic Principles**

The NeXTSTEP user interface is designed with certain basic principles in mind. Four are especially important:

- The interface should be consistent across all applications.
- The user is in charge of the workspace and its windows.
- The interface should feel natural to the user.
- The mouse (not the keyboard) is the primary instrument for user input.

Each of these principles is discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.
