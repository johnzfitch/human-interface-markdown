A transport should display a status slip whenever it is engaged in some lengthy activity such as sending or receiving data. A transport's status slip includes a transport icon, a status message, and a large Close box. Most status slips also have a Stop button. In addition, a status slip can include the title of the item being routed and a progress indicator. If a transport needs to have a user choose between two alternatives, it can display a status slip with up to three lines of text and two buttons. The system defines several standard types of status slips, as shown in [Figure 7-21.](#page-235-0)

<span id="page-236-0"></span>Transports can dynamically switch from one type of status slip to another without closing the status slip, and can easily update the contents of the status slip as well (for example, updating a progress indicator).  
All transports that use the standard status slips have a similar user interface and match the use of other status slips throughout the system. For general information on status slips, see ["Status Slips" on page 2-20](#page-63-0).  
A status slip's Close box allows a user to hide the slip without halting the action that the slip is monitoring. If a user taps a status slip's Close box, the transport closes the slip and registers the action with the system's Notify service. The Notify service displays the flashing notify button at the top of the screen and adds the action to the Notify picker as described in ["Notify](#page-243-0)  [Button and Picker" on page 8-2](#page-243-0). The action continues in the background, and the user can perform another task. The user can also redisplay a status slip by choosing the corresponding action from the Notify picker. If a transport completes an action while its status slip is not displayed, the transport must unregister the action so the Notify service will remove it from the Notify picker.  
A status slip's Stop button allows a user to halt the action that the slip is monitoring, as described in the next section.
