Mobile users don't have the time to read through a lot of help content before they can use your application. What's more, you don't want to give up valuable space to display or store it. A hallmark of the design of iPhone OS–based devices is ease of use, so it's crucial that you meet users' expectations and make the use of your application immediately obvious. There are a few things you can do to achieve this:  
- Use standard controls correctly. Users are familiar with the standard controls they see in the built-in applications, so they already know how to use them in your application.
- Be sure the path through the information you present is logical and easy for users to predict. In addition, be sure to provide markers, such as back buttons, that users can use to find out where they are and how to retrace their steps.
