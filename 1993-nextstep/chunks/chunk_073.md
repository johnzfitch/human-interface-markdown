Windows on-screen are ordered from front to back. Like sheets of paper loosely stacked together, windows in front can overlap, or even completely cover, those behind them. Each window has a unique position in the order. When two windows are placed side-by-side, one is still technically in front of the other.  
If any window could be in front of any other window, then small but important windowslike menus and docked icons-might get lost behind larger ones. Windows that require user action, like attention panels and pop-up lists, might disappear behind another window and go unnoticed. To prevent this, all the windows on-screen are organized into *tiers.*  
When two windows belong to the same tier, either one can be in front. When two windows belong to different tiers, however, the one in the higher tier will always be above the other. on-screen windows are divided into these seven tiers:  
- Windows that appear in a spring-loaded mode-pop-up lists, pull-down lists, and menus that come to the cursor-are assigned the frontmost tier. (Having menus come to the cursor is an option that the user can enable with the Preferences application. It's described in "Bringing the Main Menu to the Cursor" in Chapter 6.) Spring-loaded windows remain on-screen only while the user holds a mouse button down, so they only momentarily obscure other windows. Putting them in the first tier guarantees that they won't appear in back of another window.
- Attention panels are assigned to the second tier. Like spring-loaded windows, they're only temporarily on-screen. But unlike spring-loaded windows, the user must do something to dismiss them, rather than continue an action to keep them visible. Keeping an attention panel in front, where it can't be covered by other windows, confronts the user with it until it's dismissed and thus encourages prompt user action.
- The main menu is assigned the next tier back. In the absence of an attention panel or spring-loaded window, the usual case, it's the frontmost window on-screen.  
#### **Writing Note: The Meaning of Window**  
In documentation for users, the term windowgenerally refers only to standard windows, though panels and menus are acknowledged to be windows of a special type. Miniwindows, lists, and icons are referred to only by their specific names; they should not be included within the generic term window as this would imply common behavior that's lacking.  
- Other menus are assigned to a tier just below the main menu. They can cover each other, but not the main menu.
- Docked application icons occupy the fifth tier. They can be covered by lists, attention panels, and menus, but not by the ordinary windows of your application.
- Floating panels are in the sixth tier. Floating panels are defined and discussed in Chapter 5.
- All other windows are grouped in the seventh-the last and largest-tier. Most of the windows seen on-screen are in this tier. They can cover each other, but can't come in front of the dock, menus, attention panels, or spring-loaded windows.  
This seven-tier system keeps attention panels, menus, and docked application icons in view, and thus readily available to the user; it prevents them from being inadvertently lost in a large pile of windows. Although attention panels, menus, and docked application icons can cover other windows, the user can get them out of the way when needed. Menus can be moved to the side or closed, and the dock can be slid mostly off-screen. Attention panels should be attended to and dismissed.  
To get the user's attention, when a window is first placed on-screen it comes up at the front of its tier.  
**Note:** Even when a window is totally obscured by other windows, it's still considered to be on-screen; it retains its ranking in the order and can be exposed by moving the windows in front to the side.
