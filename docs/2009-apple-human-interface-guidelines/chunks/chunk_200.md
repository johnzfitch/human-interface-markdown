The right side of the menu bar may contain items that provide feedback on and access to certain hardware or network settings. These menu bar extras display some type of status in the menu bar and include a menu to change settings. The icon for the battery strength indicator, for example, dynamically displays the current state of the battery for a portable computer, and the menu has common battery settings. Users can display or hide a menu bar extra in the appropriate preferences pane.  
If there is not enough room in the menu bar to display all menus, Mac OS X automatically removes menu bar extrasto make room for application menus, which take precedence. Similarly, if there are too many menu bar extras, Mac OS X may remove some of them to avoid crowding application menus. For these reasons, and because users can choose to hide menu bar extras, you should not rely on their presence.  
**Note:** An alternative to creating a menu bar extra is to use the Dock menu functions to open a menu from your application's icon in the Dock. See "Dock [Menus"](#page-189-0) (page 190) for more information.
