Memory is a critical resource in iPhone OS, so managing memory in your application is crucial. Because the iPhone OS virtual memory model does not include disk swap space, you must take care to avoid allocating more memory than is available on the device. When low-memory conditions occur, iPhone OS warns the running application and may terminate the application if the problem persists. Be sure your application is responsive to memory usage warnings and cleans up memory in a timely manner.  
As you design your application,strive to reduce the application's memory footprint by, for example, eliminating memory leaks, making resource files as small as possible, and loading resources lazily. See *iPhone Application Programming Guide* for extensive information about how to design iPhone applications that handle memory appropriately.
