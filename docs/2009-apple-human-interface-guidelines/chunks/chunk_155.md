<span id="page-138-4"></span><span id="page-138-2"></span>**Icon genres** help communicate what users can do with an application before they open it. Applications are classified by role—user applications, software utilities, and so on—and each category, or genre, has its own icon style. Creating icons that express this differentiation helps users distinguish between types of icons in the Dock.

For example, the icons for user applications are colorful and inviting, whereas icons for utilities have a more serious appearance. Figure 11-2 shows user application icons in the top row and utility icons in the bottom row. These genres are further described in "User [Application](#page-139-1) Icons" (page 140) and ["Utility](#page-141-1) Icons" (page 142).

In iTunes, for example, a visual cue provided in the application icon is carried over into icons for other files associated with iTunes, forming an icon family, as shown in Figure 11-3.
