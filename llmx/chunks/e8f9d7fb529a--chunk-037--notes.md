#### Notes  
Typing any printing character will automatically insert that character into the input line at the current cursor position.  
Pressing RETURN with the cursor anywhere within the input line will accept the entire input.  
Default responses are displayed with the cursor at the end of the response.  
RETURN will accept that response.  
LEFT-ARROW will move cursor back into the default response, enabling the  
user to edit it.  
RIGHT-ARROW will signal that you wish to append material to the response.  
CTRL-SPACE  
or DELETE will delete a single character from the end of a response and  
signal that you wish to edit the response.
