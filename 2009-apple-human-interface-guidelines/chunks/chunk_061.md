Clicking an application icon in the Dock should always result in a window becoming active.  
● If the application is not open, a new window should open. In a document-based application, the application should open a new, untitled window. In an application that is not document-based, the main application window should open.  
<span id="page-62-5"></span>● When a user clicks an open application's icon in the Dock, the application becomes active and all open unminimized windows are brought to the front; minimized document windows remain in the Dock. If there are no unminimized windows when the user clicks the Dock icon, the last minimized window should be expanded and made active. If no windows are open, the application should open a new window—a new untitled window for document-based applications, otherwise the main application window.  
When you press and hold the Dock icon of a running application, two things happen:  
- Exposé displays all windows currently open in the application (including minimized windows)
- A minimal Dock menu appears that allows you to:
- Quit the application
- Hide or show the application's windows
- Show the application in the Finder and manage the Keep in Dock and Open at Login options  
When you click and hold the Dock icon of an application that is not running, a minimal Dock menu appears that allows you to:  
- Open the application
- Show the application in the Finder and manage the Remove from Dock and Open at Login options  
When you Control-click the Dock icon of a running application, a customizable Dock menu appears. By default, this menu displays the same items as the minimal Dock menu you see when you press and hold the application's Dock icon. In addition, this menu lists all open windows (including minimized windows) and may contain application-specific items. See "Dock [Menus"](#page-189-0) (page 190) for more information on customizing this Dock menu.
