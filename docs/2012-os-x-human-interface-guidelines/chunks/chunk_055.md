Almost all apps need to use some words to communicate with users, even if the only words are in button labels. It'simportant to choose all of your app's words carefully so that you can ensure that your communication with users is unambiguous and accurate.  
**In general, avoid jargon.** Above all, you want to use the terminology your users are comfortable with. If your app targets sophisticated users who frequently use a set of specialized, technical terms, it makes sense to use these terms in your app. On the other hand, if your user audience consists of mostly novice or casual users, it's better to use simpler, more generally understood terms.  
**Avoid developer terms.** As a developer, you refer to UI elements and app processes in ways that most users don't understand. Be sure to scrutinize your UI and replace any developer terms with appropriate user terms. For example, Table 3-2 lists several common developer terms, along with equivalent user terms you should use instead.

<span id="page-61-0"></span>**Use proper Apple terminology.** If you need to refer to standard parts of the UI or to system features, be sure to use the terms that Apple defines. For example, if you need to describe the use of a checkbox in your UI, tell the user to "select" the checkbox, not to "check," "click," or "turn on" the checkbox. Or, if you mention how to start your app by clicking your app icon in the Dock, be sure to capitalize "Dock."
