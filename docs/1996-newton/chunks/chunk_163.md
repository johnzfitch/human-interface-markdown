Most received items remain in the In Box until a user disposes of them. To dispose of In Box items, a user selects one or more of them and chooses an  
action from the Tag picker, which pops up when the user taps the Tag button. The Tag picker lists only actions that apply to at least one of the selected items. Figure 7-20 shows a sample Tag button and Tag picker.

#### Putting Away Received Items 7  
The Tag picker includes the Put Away action if an item the user has selected can be transferred from the In Box to another installed Newton application. Each application registers with the system the types of items it can accept from the In Box. For example, the built-in Notepad application accepts text items such as e-mail messages in addition to regular Notepad items.  
Independent of applications' abilities to accept items from the In Box, each transport can include a method for putting away items it has received. If a transport can put away an item the user has selected, the Tag picker includes a Put Away action whether or not any applications have registered to accept that type of item.  
When a user chooses to put away an item, the In Box displays a slip identifying the target application. If there are multiple targets—multiple applications that can accept the item and a transport with a put-away method—the slip includes a picker label that the user can tap to pop up a list picker from which to choose one of the targets. The slip also gives the user the option of having that item deleted from the In Box or having a copy kept there.  
If no application has registered to accept an item the user has selected, and the transports that received the selected items do not know how to put away items, the Tag picker does not include the Put Away action. For example, none  
<span id="page-233-0"></span>of the built-in applications registers to accept page-image data like faxes, and the built-in fax transport does not include a method for putting away items it receives, so the Tag picker does not include a Put Away action when a user selects only faxes in the In Box. The Tag picker does include Put Away when a user selects faxes together with some other class of data that can be put away, but the selected faxes are not put away.  
#### Putting Away Items Automatically 7  
The In Box can put away some incoming items automatically. That happens if an application has registered to automatically accept items designated for it. As soon as the In Box receives such an item, it transfers the item from the In Box to the application without user intervention. For example, the In Box could automatically transfer incoming stock quotes from a wireless modem to a stock-tracking application. If the In Box can't automatically put away a received item because the target application is missing (perhaps it is on a card that is not inserted), the In Box holds the item until the application is present. Then the In Box automatically transfers all items it is holding for that application. What happens to an item after the In Box automatically puts it away depends on the transport involved. The transport may have the In Box delete the item, delete the item and make a log entry in the In Box, or keep a copy of the item.  
#### Filing Items That Are Put Away 7  
In general, when an application gets items from the In Box it should put them away unfiled so users can find them. If an application puts away an item without regard to its folder, the item will be filed in the same folder on the receiving Newton as it occupied on the sending Newton. That could make the item hard for a user to find, especially if the folder is undefined on the receiving Newton. Your application can alleviate this problem by putting away all items unfiled even if the recipient has a folder of the same name as the sender.  
#### <span id="page-234-0"></span>Extending the Tag Picker 7  
A transport can add actions to the Tag picker. For example, an e-mail transport might add the actions Reply and Forward so users could reply to and forward received e-mail directly from the In Box. The built-in transports define the following action items: Reply, Forward, Copy Text to Notepad, and Add Sender to Names. There is a standard icon for each of these actions. If you create a new transport that includes these actions, use the standard icons for them.
