You can create a modeless utility window, such as a tools palette, to present controls or settings that affect the active document window. A user can open several utility windows at a time; they float on top of document windows. When a user makes a document active, all of the application's utility windows are brought to the front, regardless of which document was active when the user opened the utility window.

Special Windows **87**  
<span id="page-87-3"></span>Utility windows are useful for keeping extremely important controls or information accessible at all times in the context of a user task. Because utility windows take up screen space, however, don't use them when you can solve the need with a modeless dialog (the user changes settings and then closes the dialog) or by adding a few appropriate controls to a window frame.  
You need to create and maintain any utility windows for your application. Whenever your application is in the background, hide all utility windows. Utility windows should not be listed in the Window menu as documents, but you may put commands to show or hide utility windows in the Window menu.  
Most utility windows don't have titles, but they do have an 11-pixel-high drag region at the top. If you don't want users to access the minimize or zoom button on a utility window, you can delete both of these buttons and leave only the close button. Don't delete only the zoom or minimize button; a utility window should have either all three title-bar controls or only the close button. You can specify the attributes for these controls in Interface Builder or, for Carbon developers, when creating windows with CreateNewWindow or CreateCustomWindow.
