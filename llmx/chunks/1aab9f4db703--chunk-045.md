<!-- Chunk 45 | Source: 1982 Apple IIe Design Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 175 -->
When the computer will be either carrying out computations or accessing the disk for an extended period of time, a message should be left on the screen, instructing the user that the computer will return shortly (this is not the suggested message). Some periodic change in the screen, as a lengthening line of periods (hence periodic) should occur so the user knows the computer has not simply gone into an endless loop somewhere. When the computation period is over, clearly signal it: simply showing up with a blinking cursor over in the corner won't do after a brief, 20-minute pause.
