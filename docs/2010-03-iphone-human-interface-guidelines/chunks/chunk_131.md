<span id="page-118-1"></span>A **slider** allows users to make adjustments to a value or process throughout a range of allowed values. When users drag a slider, the value or process is updated continuously. Figure 9-12 shows an example of a slider with minimum and maximum images.

Sliders are useful in two main situations:  
- When you want to allow users to have fine-grained control over the values they choose
- When you want to allow users to have fine-grained control over the current process  
A slider consists of a track, a thumb, and optional right and left value images. Figure 9-13 shows these parts of a slider.

You can set the width of a slider to fit in with the user interface of your application. In addition, you can display a slider either horizontally or vertically.  
There are several ways to customize a slider:  
- You can define the appearance of the thumb, so users can see at a glance whether the slider is active.
- You can supply images to appear at either end of the slider (typically, these correspond to minimum and maximum values), to help users understand what the slider does.
- A slider that controls font size, for example, could display a very small character at the minimum end and a very large character at the maximum end.
- You can define a different appearance for the track, depending on which side of the thumb it is on and which state the control is in.
