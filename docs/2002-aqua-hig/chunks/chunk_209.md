The user can select a range of text by dragging. A range can consist of characters, words, lines, or paragraphs, as defined by the application.  
In text fields, clicking should perform the following actions:  
- Single-clicking places the insertion point at the pointer's location in the text.
- <span id="page-189-3"></span>■ Double-clicking within a word selects the word. The selection should provide "smart" behavior; if the user deletes the selected word, for example, the space after the word should also be deleted.
- Double-clicking in a space selects the space.
- <span id="page-189-5"></span>■ Triple-clicking selects the next logical unit, as defined by the application. In a word-processing document, triple-clicking in a word selects the paragraph containing the word. In a table, triple-clicking selects the cell.
