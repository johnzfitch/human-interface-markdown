The pointer should always be visible. Most of the time, when it's being used for selecting and pointing, it should remain black—color might not be visible over potentially different colored backgrounds, and wouldn't give the user any extra information. However, when the user is drawing or typing in color, the drawing or text-insertion pointer should appear in the color that is being used. Except for multicolored paintbrush pointers, the pointer shouldn't contain more than one color at once—it's hard for the eye to discriminate small areas of color.
