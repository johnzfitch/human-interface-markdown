This document identifies three application styles, based on visual and behavioral characteristics, data model, and user experience. Before you read further, it's important to emphasize that these varieties are named and described to help you clarify some of your design decisions, not to imply that there is a rigid classification scheme that all iPhone software must follow. Instead, these styles are described to help you see how different approaches can be suitable for different types of information and functionality.  
The iPhone OS Platform: Rich with Possibilities  
**Note:** Bear in mind that application style does not dictate implementation method. This document focuses on designing iPhone applications, but the application styles explored here can be implemented in any type of software.  
As you read about these three application styles, think about how the characteristics of each might enhance your proposed feature set and the overall user experience you plan to deliver in your iPhone application. To help you discover the combination of characteristics that best suit your application, keep the following questions in mind as you learn about different design styles for iPhone applications:  
- What do you expect to be the user's motivation for using the application?
- What do you intend to be the user's experience while using the application?
- What is the goal or focus of your application?
- <span id="page-18-0"></span>■ How does your application organize and display the information people care about? Is there a natural organization associated with the main task of the application?  
#### Productivity Applications  
A **productivity application** enables tasks that are based on the organization and manipulation of detailed information. People use productivity applications to accomplish important tasks. Mail is a good example of a productivity application.  
Seriousness of purpose does not mean that productivity applications should attempt to appear serious by providing a dry, uninspiring user experience, but it does mean that users appreciate a streamlined approach that does not hinder them. To this end,successful productivity applications keep the user experience focused on the task, so people can quickly find what they need, easily perform the necessary actions, complete the task, and move on to something else.  
Productivity applications often organize user data hierarchically. In this way, people can find information by making progressively more specific choices until they arrive at the desired level of detail. iPhone OS provides table elements that make this process extremely efficient on iPhone OS devices (see "Table [Views"](#page-76-1) (page 77) for more information about these user interface elements). Figure 1-1 shows an example of this type of data organization.  
**Application** Top level Detail level  
<span id="page-19-0"></span>**Figure 1-1** Productivity applications tend to organize information hierarchically  
Typically, the user interaction model in a productivity application consists of:  
- Organizing the list
- Adding to and subtracting from the list
- Drilling down through successive levels of detail until the desired level is reached, then performing tasks with the information on that level  
Productivity applications tend to use multiple views, usually displaying one level of the hierarchy per view. The user interface tendsto be simple, uncluttered, and composed ofstandard views and controls. Productivity applications do not tend to customize the interface much, because the focus is on the information and the task, and not as much on the environment or the experience.  
Among all types of iPhone applications, a productivity application is the most likely to supply preferences, or settings, the user can specify in the Settings application. This is because productivity applications work with lots of information and, potentially, many ways to access and manage it. It's important to emphasize, however, that the usershould seldom need to change these settings,so the settingsshould not targetsimple configuration changes that could be handled in the main user interface.  
#### <span id="page-20-0"></span>Utility Applications  
A **utility application** performs a simple task that requires a minimum of user input. People open a utility application to see a quick summary of information or to perform a simple task on a limited number of objects. The Weather application (shown in Figure 1-2) is a good example of a utility application because it displays a narrowly focused amount of information in an easy-to-scan summary.

Utility applications are visually attractive, but in a way that enhances the information they display without overshadowing it. People use utility applications to check the status of something or to look something up, so they want to be able to spot the information they're interested in quickly and easily. To facilitate this, a utility application's user interface is uncluttered and provides simple, often standard, views and controls.  
A utility application tends to organize information into a flattened list of items; users do not usually need to drill down through a hierarchy of information. Typically, each view in a utility application provides the same organization of data and depth of detail, but can be served by a different source. In this way, users can open a single utility application to see similar treatments of multiple subjects. Some utility applications indicate the number of open views; users can navigate through them sequentially, selecting one view after another. Figure 1-3 shows an example of this type of data organization.  
<span id="page-21-0"></span>**Figure 1-3** Utility applications tend to present data in a flattened list  
![](images/_page_21_Figure_3.jpeg)  
The user interaction model for a utility application is very simple: Users open the application to scan a summary of information and, optionally, change the configuration or source of that information. Utility applications may need to support frequent changes to configuration or information source, so they often provide a small set of such options on the back of the main view. Users tap the familiar Info button in the lower-right corner of the main view to see the back. After making adjustments, users tap the Done button to return to the front of the main view. In a utility application, the options on the back of the main view are part of the functioning of the application, not a group of preference-style settings users access once and then rarely, if ever, again. For thisreason, utility applicationsshould notsupply application-specific settingsin the Settings application. Figure 1-4 shows how the Weather application provides configuration options on the back of the main view.

#### <span id="page-22-0"></span>Immersive Applications  
An **immersive application** offers a full-screen, visually rich environment that's focused on the content and the user's experience with that content. People often use immersive applicationsto have fun, whether playing a game, viewing media-rich content, or performing a simple task.  
It's easy to see how games fit this style of iPhone application, but you can also imagine how characteristics of immersive applications can enhance other types of tasks. Tasks that present a unique environment, don't display large amounts of text-based information, and reward users for their attention are good candidates for the immersive approach. For example, an application that replicates the experience of using a bubble level works well in a graphics-rich, full-screen environment, even though it doesn't fit the definition of a game. In such an application, as in a game, the user's focus is on the visual content and the experience, not on the data behind the experience. Figure 1-5 shows an example of an immersive application that replicates an actual experience and enables a simple task.  
<span id="page-22-1"></span>**Figure 1-5** An immersive application doesn't have to be a game  
![](images/_page_22_Picture_6.jpeg)  
**Note:** Although applications that launch in landscape orientation should launch so that the Home button is on the right, the Bubble Level application shown above in Figure 1-5 launches in the opposite orientation. This ensures that the physical buttons on the edge of the device don't interfere with the measurement. See ["Starting"](#page-44-1) (page 45) for more launch guidelines.  
An immersive application tends to hide much of the device's user interface, replacing it with a custom user interface that strengthens the user's sense of entering the world of the application. Users expect seeking and discovery to be part of the experience of an immersive application, so the use of nonstandard controls is often appropriate.  
Immersive applications may work with large amounts of data, but they do not usually organize and expose it so that users can view it sequentially or drill down through it. Instead, immersive applications present information in the context of the game-play,story, or experience. Also for thisreason, immersive applications often present custom navigational methods that complement the environment, rather than the standard, data-driven methods used in utility or productivity applications.  
The iPhone OS Platform: Rich with Possibilities  
The user interaction model for an immersive application is determined by the experience the application provides. Although it's not likely that a game would need to offer application-specific settings in Settings, other types of immersive applications might. Immersive applications might also furnish configuration options on the back of the main view.
