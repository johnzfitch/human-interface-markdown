In arrays and text in which Shift-click extends a continuous selection, the user can make discontinuous selections by holding down the Command key and clicking. Each Command-click adds the new object to the existing selection. If one of the objects selected with Command-click is already within an existing part of the selection, then it is removed from the selection instead of being added.

Not all applications support discontinuous selections, and those that do might restrict the operations a user can perform on them. For example, a word processor might allow the user to choose a font after making a discontinuous selection, but not allow the user to type replacement characters, because it wouldn't be obvious which part of the selection the characters would replace.
