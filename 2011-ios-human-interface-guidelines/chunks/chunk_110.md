On iPhone, a tab bar can display no more than five tabs at one time; if the app has more tabs, the tab bar displays four of them and adds the More tab, which reveals the additional tabs in a list. On iPad, a tab bar can display more than five tabs.  
A tab can display a badge (a red oval that contains white text, either a number or exclamation point) that communicates app-specific information.  
A tab bar does not change its opacity or height, regardless of device orientation.
