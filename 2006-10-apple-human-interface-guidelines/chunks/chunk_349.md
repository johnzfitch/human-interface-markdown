The size of the tab views changed between Mac OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) and Mac OS X version 10.3 (Panther). There are no size changes for tab views in Mac OS X version 10.4 (Tiger). This section discusses how the earlier change in size affects applications that must run on versions of Mac OS X prior to version 10.3.  
If you are supporting only Mac OS X v10.3 and later, then you do not need to do anything. Follow the guidelines in "Tab [Views"](#page-278-0) (page 279).  
If you need to support Mac OS X v10.2 (or earlier) in addition to Mac OS X v10.3, then you need to consider the differences.  
The Mac OS X v10.2 tabs were 29 pixels high from the top of the tab to the bottom of the bar under the tab. The Mac OS X v10.3 and latertabs are only20 pixels high. This means that ifyou have designed your user interface elements for Mac OS X v10.2, there will be an additional space of 4 pixels under the tabs when viewed in Mac OS X v10.3 or later and a space of 5 pixels above.

Considering your users, you must decide whether to redesign your interface so that it does not use tabs, or to allow the new spacing and adhere to the Mac OS X v10.2 specification for spacing around the tab views.
