#### **Displaying a Group with an Unrestricted Relationship**  
To show a group of choices with an unrestricted relationship, as opposed to a one-of-many relationship, you should use one of the following:  
- A group of switches
- A group of graphical two-state buttons that don't look like graphical radio buttons
- A selection list

switches

two state buttons with space between them

a selection list  
Switches and graphical two-state buttons are preferred, since selection lists are less attractive and don't give clues as to how many selections can be made at once. (If you use two-state buttons, be careful that they don't look like graphical radio buttons.) When space is tight or the list of choices can grow or shrink, a selection list might be more appropriate.
