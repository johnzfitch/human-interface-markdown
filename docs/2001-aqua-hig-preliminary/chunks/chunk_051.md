Users can open a document window by  
#### Windows  
- double-clicking a document icon in the Finder
- selecting the document in the Finder and pressing Command-O
- choosing a file from an Open dialog
- choosing the New command from the File menu  
When your application displays a new document window, name it "untitled"; leaving it lowercase makes it more obvious that the window doesn't have a name and encourages people to save the document.  
If the user chooses New again before saving the first untitled window, name the second window "untitled2," and so on. Add numbers to window titles only when there is more than one open untitled window. Don't put a "1" on the first untitled window, even after the user opens other new windows.

Do not leave title blank.  
When the user opens an existing document, display its name exactly as it appears in the Finder.
