Translatingtext is a sophisticated, delicate task. Avoid usingcolloquial phrases or nonstandard usage and syntax. Carefully choose words for menu commands, dialogs, and help text. Text in U.S. English can grow up to 50 percent longer when translated to other languages.  
Use complete sentences in string resources whenever possible. Grammar problems may arise when you concatenate multiple strings to create sentences; theword order maybecome completely different in another language, rendering the message nonsensical when translated. For example, word order in German sometimes places the verb at the end of a sentence. For more information on handling text in other languages, see *Internationalization Programming Topics*.
