A selection in the active folder is defined and marked by pointing and dragging with the mouse. As the mouse is dragged, the size of selection increases or decreases. This is visible to the user, who sees the selection's highlighting expanding or shrinking as the mouse is moved about.  
There are several special ways to make a selection other than simply dragging from one end to the other. The first of these is double- and triple-clicking to select larger entities.  
Double clicking in text (releasing the button and pressing again within 1/2 second) selects the entire word surrounding the position of the initial click and extends the selection by words while dragging. Punctuation and spacing are taken a character at a time when extending by words.  
Triple clicking in text selects the entire paragraph surrounding the initial position and extends by paragraphs.  
More than three clicks separated by less than 1/2 second are interpreted as three clicks.  
In a folder which presents a split view of a document, dragging from one view pane into another will extend the selection to the portion of the document visible in the second view pane.

If you start a selection and then drag outside the entire folder while still holding the mouse button down, the document in the folder will scroll to show more. When the other end is in view, move the cursor back into the folder to stop scrolling and release the button to complete the selection.  
If a selection is too long for the above methods to be practical, or if an incorrect selection is made and the user wants to adjust it without starting all over, then "SHIFT-BUTTON" may be used. If either SHIFT key on the keyboard is being held down when the mouse button is pressed, then instead of starting a new selection, an endpoint of the selection (the one on the same side of the initial "anchor" point of the selection as the cursor is) is adjusted just as if the button were already down during a normal selection that started on the other end.
