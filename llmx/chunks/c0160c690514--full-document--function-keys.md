# **Function keys**

Some Apple keyboards include function keys. There are two types of function keys, dedicated and nondedicated. The nondedicated function keys—labeled F1 through F15—are definable by the user, *not* by the application. F1 through F4 represent Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste in any applications that use these commands.

The six dedicated function keys are labeled Help, Del, Home, End, Page up, and Page down. These keys are used as follows:

- Help. Pressing the Help key should produce help; this is equivalent to pressing Command-? (or Command-/). The sort of help available varies among applications; if a full, contextual help system is not available, some sort of useful help screen should be provided.
- **Del.** Pressing Del performs a forward delete: the character directly to the right of the insertion point is removed, shifting everything to the right of the removed character one character position back. The effect is that the insertion point remains stable while it "vacuums" everything ahead of it.
  - If Del is pressed when there is a current selection, it has the same effect as pressing Delete (Backspace) or choosing Clear from the Edit menu.
- Home. Pressing the Home key is equivalent to moving the scroll boxes (elevators) all the way to the top of the vertical scroll bar and to the left end of the horizontal scroll bar. It has no effect on the location of the insertion point or any selected material.
- End. This is the opposite of Home: it's equivalent to moving the scroll boxes (elevators) all the way to the bottom of the vertical scroll bar and to the right end of the horizontal scroll bar. It has no effect on the location of the insertion point or any selected material.
- Page up. This is equivalent to clicking the mouse pointer in the upper gray region of the vertical scroll bar. It has no effect on the location of the insertion point or any selected material.
- Page down. This is equivalent to clicking the mouse pointer in the lower gray region of the vertical scroll bar. It has no effect on the location of the insertion point or any selected material.
