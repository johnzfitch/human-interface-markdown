<span id="page-160-4"></span>This chapter discussesthe standard pointers available in Mac OS X and providesinformation on implementing your own pointers. The standard pointers are designed to provide feedback to users. To maintain a consistent user experience, it is important that you use them only for their intended purpose.  
<span id="page-160-3"></span>Each pointer has a **hot spot**—the portion of the pointer that must be positioned over a screen object before mouse clicks or finger taps have an effect on the object. The hot spot should be intuitive, such as the tip of an arrow pointer or the center point of a crosshair. Screen objects have a **hot zone**—the area that the pointer's hot spot must be within in order for clicks to have an effect.
