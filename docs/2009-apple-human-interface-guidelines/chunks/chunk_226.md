Mac OS X includes standard windows for users to select fonts or colors. If you need a way for users to set fonts or colors, use these standard windows instead of creating your own. In this way, users don't have to learn a new way to accomplish a familiar task. Figure 14-44 shows these standard system-provided panels.
