Users expect all the buttons at the bottom right of a dialog to dismiss the dialog. A button that initiates an action is furthest to the right. This rightmost button, called the **action button**, confirms the main point of the dialog. The Cancel button is to the left of the action button.  
Usually the rightmost button or the Cancel button is the **default button**. A default button has color to let users know that when they press Return or Enter, the default button is activated.

**Use a default button only if the user's most likely action is harmless.** Make the default button represent the action that the user is most likely to perform *if* that action isn't potentially dangerous. Users sometimes press Return merely to dismiss a dialog, without reading its content, so it's crucial to ensure that the default button performs a harmless action.  
**Don't use a default button if the user's most likely action is dangerous.** An example of a dangerous action is one that causes a loss of user data. When there is no default button, pressing Return or Enter has no effect; the user must explicitly click a button to dismiss the dialog. This guideline protects users from accidentally damaging their work by pressing Return or Enter without fully understanding the dialog's message. You can consider using a safe default button, such as Cancel, or not using a default button at all.  
**Don't use a default button if you use the Return key in the dialog's text fields.** Having two behaviors for one key can confuse users and make the interface less predictable. Also, users might press Return one too many times and dismiss the dialog (and activate the default button) without meaning to.  
**In general, include a Cancel button.** The Cancel button returns the computer to the state it was in before the dialog appeared. It means"forget I mentioned it." Also, make sure that the keyboard shortcut Command-period and the Esc (Escape) key are mapped to the Cancel button.  
**Ensure that Cancel undoes applied changes.** If your dialog includes an Apply button that helps users see the effect of changes before committing to them, make sure that clicking Cancel undoes all of the applied changes. Cancel should never silently commit the changes the user previewed by clicking Apply. For more guidelines on using an Apply button, see [Accepting](#page-153-0) and Applying User Input in a Dialog (page 154).  
**Place a third button for dismissing the dialog to the left of the Cancel button.** If the third button could result in data loss—Don't Save, for example—try to position it at least 24 points away from the "safe" buttons (Cancel and Save, for example).  
**Place a button that affects the contents of the dialog itself in the left end of the dialog.** If there is no Help button, locate a button that affects dialog contents so that its left edge is aligned with the main dialog text. If there is a Help button, place the button to the right of the Help button. For example, the Help button is to the left of the Show Details button in the Print dialog, which expands the dialog to display more information about the print job.
