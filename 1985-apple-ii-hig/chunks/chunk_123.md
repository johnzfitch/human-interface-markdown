The "select-then-choose" paradigm is sufficient whenever operations are simple and act on only one object. But occasionally a command will require more than one object, or will need additional parameters before it can be executed. And sometimes a command won't be able to carry out its normal function, or will be unsure of the user's real intent. For these special circumstances the windowing user interface includes three additional features:  
- dialogs, to allow the user to provide additional information
before a command is executed
- alerts, to notify the user whenever an unusual situation occurs
- view, to enable the user of a text-based program to "look inside" the diamond icon  
Since all of these features lean heavily on controls, controls are described in this section, even though controls are also used in other places.
