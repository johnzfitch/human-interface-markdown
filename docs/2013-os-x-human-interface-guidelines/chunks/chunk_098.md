A great app icon is not only gorgeous and inviting, it also conveys the main purpose of the app and hints at the user experience. As you decide how to best represent your app through its icon, it's helpful to examine some successful icon designs.  
User app icons are vibrant and inviting, and should immediately convey the app's purpose. For example, the Photo Booth icon clearly indicates that this app helps users take pictures of themselves.

In an app that primarily helps users create or view media, it makes sense for the icon to include the media. If appropriate, the icon might also depict a tool to communicate the type of task that the app helps the user accomplish. The Preview icon (shown below) uses a magnification tool to help convey that the app can be used to view pictures. The proximity of the magnifier to the pictures makes it clear that the tool's function is directly related to the content the app handles.

In the Stickies app icon, the yellow rectangles are easily identifiable as sticky notes. In a sense, the sticky note itself functions as a tool, so the icon doesn't include a pen or other writing utensil because it isn't necessary to tell the icon's story.

Some appsthat represent objects or well-known products,such as QuickTime Player, Dashboard, and FaceTime, are most easily recognized by enhanced versions of the symbols or objects themselves. Note that these app icons (shown below) use the straight-on perspective because users never see these objects from the three-dimensional, "on a desktop" perspective.

Icons for utility apps tend to convey a more serious tone than those for user apps. Color in utility app icons is desaturated, predominantly gray, and added only when necessary to clearly communicate what the apps do. For example, notice the prevalence of gray and the discriminating use of color in the System Information, Activity Monitor, and Keychain icons shown below:
