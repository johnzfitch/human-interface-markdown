<!-- Chunk 34 | Source: 1987 Apple Human Interface Guidelines - The Apple Desktop Interface.pdf | Est. Tokens: 226 -->
Apple's goal in adding color to the Desktop Interface is to add meaning, not just to color things so they "look good." Color can be a valuable additional channel of information to the user, but must be used carefully, otherwise, it can have the opposite of the intended effect and can be visually overwhelming (or look gamelike).  
Color is ultimately the domain of the user, who should be able to modify or remove any coloring imposed by the application. Unless you are implementing a color application such as a paint or draw program, you should consider color only for the data, not the interface.  
To implement color successfully in an application, you should understand some of the complex issues surrounding its use. Many major theories on the proper use of color are not complete or well defined. The way in which the human eye sees color is not fully understood, nor are color's subjective effects.
