# Human Interaction: Pointing, Selecting, and Editing

The computer and the human user interact mainly through an **application program** (often called simply an *application*). An application is any program that allows the user to manipulate any kind of information within a computer system. When an application is active, it's in control of all communications between the user and the system. The active application's menus are in the menu bar, to the right of the standard menus.

A document is where an application stores the data that the user creates. Each document is a unified collection of information—a business letter, list, worksheet, chart, animation sequence, or piece of music. A complex application, such as a data base system, might require several related documents. Some documents can be processed by more than one application; but each document has a *principal application*, which is usually the one that created it. If other applications can process the same document, they are called the document's *secondary applications*. Opening a document, whether through a menu or through double clicking its icon, launches the application that originally created that document (assuming the application is on a mounted disk or in memory).

The only way the user can access the document is through a window. A window is a view into the document—if the document is larger than the window, the window is a view of a portion of the document. The application puts one or more windows on the screen, each window showing a view of a document or of auxiliary information used in processing the document.

Generally, it is unwise to allow multiple windows for the same document. It confuses the relationship of windows to icons ("which window do I close to close the document?"). If multiple views are desirable, the window can be split. The part of the screen underlying all the windows is called the **desktop**.

The Finder is an application program that lets the user organize, copy, move, rename, and delete documents, and to launch other applications. When the Finder is active, and the user opens either an application or a document belonging to an application, the application becomes active and displays the document window. In a single-application environment, only one application can be active at a time, that application has control of all windows (except desk accessories), and the user returns to the Finder to change from one application to another. Multiprocessing will eventually allow several active applications to share the screen, each having control over its own windows, and the user will be able to switch applications directly, without returning to the Finder.
