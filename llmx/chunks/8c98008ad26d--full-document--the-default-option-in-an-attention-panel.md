## **The Default Option in an Attention Panel**

When a user action brings up an attention panel with a variety of choices, the default button, the one in the lower right comer of the panel, should allow the user to easily carry through with the action. It should not contradict what the user set out to do. Specifically, it should not be the Cancel button.

The default button should not perform any additional action not implied by the user request that brought up the panel. In general, it should be the safest of the alternatives (for example, Open Copy rather than Open Anyway when the user tries to open a document that someone's already opened).

The default button in an attention panel should normally be operable by pressing the Return key on the keyboard (when the panel is the key window). If so, it should be marked by the Return symbol~. However, if the button has dangerous side effects, it's acceptable to require that the user press the button.
