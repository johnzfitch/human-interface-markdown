Set the participant at ease by stressing that you're trying to find problems in the product. For example, you could say something like this:  
- "You're helping us by trying out this product in its early stages."
- "We're looking for places where the product may be difficult to use."
- "If you have trouble with some of the tasks, *it's the product's fault,* not yours. Don't feel bad; that's exactly what we're looking for."
- "If we can locate the trouble spots, then we can go back and improve the product."
- "Remember, we're testing the product, not you."
