By default, a search field displays the magnifying icon at its left edge. A search field can also contain an icon the user clicks to stop the search or clear the field. It's appropriate to use this icon if the user has to click a button or press a key to initiate the search, especially if the search might take more than a second or two. If you use this icon, consider displaying a progress indicator for lengthy searches. The magnifying glass and stop-search icons are supplied automatically.  
A search field can include a menu that allows users to view a history of recent searches. However, if you provide this functionality you should consider not providing it by default; you should also allow users to turn it off for privacy reasons. If you need to allow usersto choose different types ofsearches or define the context or scope of a search, consider providing a scope bar in your window (see ["Scope](#page-200-0) Bars" (page 201) for more information).  
A search field does not need an introductory label because users recognize this control (and the magnifying glass icon) from elsewhere in Mac OS X. If you place a search field in a toolbar, however, you should supply the label "Search" to be displayed when users customize the toolbar to show icons and text or text only.
