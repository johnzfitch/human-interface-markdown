- **Menu bar status items.** In Mac OS X 10.1, the right side of the menu bar may contain icons that display real-time status information on selected hardware or networking facilities, and provide direct access to common settings. See ["Menu](#page-60-2)  [Bar Status Items" \(page 61\).](#page-60-2) This area of the menu bar is reserved by Apple. Developers can use Dock menus (see ["Dock Menus" \(page 40\)\)](#page-39-0).
- **Apple menu.** The system-wide Apple menu has new functionality in Mac OS X. For more information, see ["The Apple Menu" \(page 52\)](#page-51-1).
- **Application menu.** This new menu displays the boldface application name and contains items pertaining to the entire application, such as Hide, Preferences, and Quit. For more information, see ["The Application Menu" \(page 53\).](#page-52-2) (The Mac OS 9 Application menu has been replaced in Mac OS X by the Dock.)
- **Window menu.** A Window menu has been introduced to aid in managing multiple open documents within an application. See ["The Window Menu"](#page-59-3) [\(page 60\).](#page-59-3)
- **Menu separators.** Pull-down menu divisions in Mac OS X are blank space (provided automatically by the Mac OS X application tools) rather than lines.
- **Sticky menus.** Sticky menus no longer close automatically after a period of time; they stay open until an action forces them to close. See ["Sticky Menus" \(page 51\)](#page-50-3).
- <span id="page-43-1"></span>■ **Dynamic menu items.** In Aqua, pull-down menu commands can be toggled while the menu is open. See ["Menu Behavior" \(page 48\).](#page-47-2)
