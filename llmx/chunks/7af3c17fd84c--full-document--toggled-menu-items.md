#### Toggled menu items

Another way to show the presence or absence of an attribute is with <sup>a</sup> toggled operation. A toggled attribute has two states, and <sup>a</sup> single menu item allows the user to "toggle" between the states. You can show the user that an operation is toggled either with check marks or by changing the wording.

Here's an example of changing the wording in <sup>a</sup> toggled menu item. When rulers are showing in <sup>a</sup> program that uses rulers, one item in the Format menu is Hide Rulers. If the user chooses this item, the rulers are hidden, and the name changes to Show Rulers (Figure 3-21). Use this technique only when the wording of the items makes it obvious that they're opposite states of the same attribute—it's better to use verbs (Turn on... /Turn off... or Hide.../Show...) rather than nouns for this sort of menu item. Undo and Redo is another good example.
