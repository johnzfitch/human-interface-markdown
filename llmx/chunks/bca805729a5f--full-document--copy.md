## Copy

Before copying something, the user must first select it. Copy puts a duplicate of the selection in the Clipboard, but the selection also remains in the document. The user can then move the insertion point and choose Paste to insert the Clipboard's contents somewhere else.

The Apple-C key combination is reserved as a keyboard substitute for Copy in the Edit menu and should be used for no other purpose.
