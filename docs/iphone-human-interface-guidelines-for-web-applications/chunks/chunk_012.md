When is a webpage an iPhone web application? It may be that the best answer is "when the user thinks it is." But when it comes to design and development and the choice of appropriate metrics, guidelines, and techniques, that answer isn't very helpful. In a document that provides material help to developers, such as this one, definitions are required for clarity and disambiguation, even if they might seem a bit arbitrary.  
As described in "Safari on [iPhone"](#page-10-0) (page 11), Safari on iPhone provides the interface for all web content on iPhone. Not surprisingly, therefore, the way a webpage works in Safari on iPhone determines how the page is defined.  
<span id="page-14-2"></span>This document distinguishes three types of webpage. The first type is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)–compliant webpage in which all elements display and operate as designed, with the exception of any elements that rely on unsupported technologies, in particular, plug-ins, Flash, or Java. This type of webpage isreferred to in this document as **compatible with Safari on iPhone**. Webpagesthat are compatible with Safari on iPhone display successfully on iPhone, even if some content is missing or the missing plug-in icon is displayed (Figure 2-1 shows this icon). However, the user interface of a webpage that is compatible with Safari on iPhone does not necessarily take into account the iPhone user interaction model (described in "The iPhone User [Interaction](#page-12-0) Model" (page 13)) and may require users to pan and zoom extensively.  
**Figure 2-1** Safari on iPhone displays the missing plug-in icon when third-party plug-ins are present

The second type of webpage is a W3C compliant–webpage that displays and operates as designed, correctly scales content for the iPhone screen, and has no elementsthat rely on unsupported technologies, in particular, plug-ins, Flash, or Java. Often, this type of webpage is designed to detect when it is being viewed on iPhone and adjusts the content it provides accordingly. This document refers to this type of webpage as **optimized for Safari on iPhone**. Webpages that are optimized for Safari on iPhone may integrate with built-in iPhone features and services, such as email and phone, where appropriate.  
In addition to meeting the requirements for a webpage that is optimized for Safari on iPhone, the third type of webpage provides discrete functionality to users and is often implemented using modern web technologies, such as AJAX. This type of webpage is referred to in this document as an **iPhone web application**. An iPhone web application emulates built-in iPhone applications by providing a focused solution to users, integrating with iPhone features and services where appropriate, and minimizing the user's awareness of the browser experience.  
Even though, at the implementation level, all three types of iPhone content are webpages, it's helpful to be able to discuss an iPhone web application as something different from a webpage that is compatible with, or optimized for, Safari on iPhone. This is because users have expectations of an application that are different from those they have of a webpage, which means that some user experience and user interface design guidelines are better suited to an application than they are to a webpage.
