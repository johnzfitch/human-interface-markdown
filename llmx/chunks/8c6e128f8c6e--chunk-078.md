Miniaturizing a window removes it from the screen without destroying it or its contents. From the user's point of view, the window is transformed into a miniwindow. Double-clicking the mini window reverses the miniaturization.  
Most standard windows and some panels have a miniaturize button. Windows that have a miniaturize button can be miniaturized using either the button or the standard Miniaturize Window menu command. A group of windows representing a single document can be miniaturized into a single miniwindow, as described under "The Document Menu" in Chapter 6.  
Users can't work in a miniaturized window, but programs can continue to alter the window's display. For example, if you begin compiling a program in a Terminal window, and then miniaturize the window, you'll see any error messages written by the compiler when you return the window to the screen. '  
Miniaturizing differs from closing in a number of ways:  
- Miniaturizing preserves the window as it was last seen on-screen. A window that's closed can't necessarily be retrieved in the same state.
- Miniaturizing a window leaves behind a mini window so that it can be brought back to the screen. Closing a window doesn't provide the user with a way of getting it back.
- Miniaturizing a window that displays a file won't close the file or change the way it's displayed. Closing a window usually closes the file it displays.
