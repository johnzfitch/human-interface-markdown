The **Help button** is a 21-pixel-high, 20-pixel-wide bevel button with the standard help icon. The preferred location is the lower left corner of the dialog box, aligned with the bottom of the push buttons, as shown in [Figure 3-36](#page-86-0). (Alert boxes do this automatically.)

If there are no push buttons or there isn't enough room in the lower left corner, the alternative location is the upper right corner, as seen in Figure 3-37.
