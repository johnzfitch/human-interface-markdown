<!-- Chunk 1 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 307 -->
The LISA User Interface has two main goals, simplicity and integration. We want LISA to be easy to learn and easy to use, so we try to do things in a simple and intuitive manner and to build on concepts already familiar to LISA users. An integrated system with a consistent user interface is easier to learn and to use. An integrated system is also more powerful than a group of seperate programs that don't interact.  
This LISA User Interface Standards Document presents the external view of what LISA looks like to the user, and expresses a set of guidelines that the LISA development team will use in an effort to achieve simplicity and integration.  
We want all Apple-supplied applications to have the same "feel" to the user, so that learning is minimized when going from application to application. Where possible, the same operation in two programs should be done in the same way and behave the same to the user. A given user action should have a consistent meaning throughout the system. Principles used in constructing system features should be extensible to similar occasions, in order to minimize user frustration.  
It is hoped that outside vendors will find it to their advantage to use these conventions as well.
