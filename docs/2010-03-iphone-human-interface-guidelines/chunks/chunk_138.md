The user interfaces of iPhone applications are characterized by beautiful images and lush color. As an application designer, you want to fit into this environment by providing an aesthetically pleasing user interface. Although iPhone OS provides a wide range of elegant and attractive user interface elements, there are two custom elements every application needs: an application icon and a launch image. In addition, applications should provide a small icon for iPhone OS to display in Spotlight search results.  
Some applications need custom icons to represent application-specific functions and modes in navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars. When you follow the guidelines for creating these icons, you can achieve results that both harmonize with the built-in icons and subtly accentuate your application's style.  
**Note:** The standard bit depth for icons and images is 24 bits (8 bits each for red, green, and blue), plus an 8-bit alpha channel. The PNG format is recommended, because it preserves color depth and supports an embedded alpha channel. You can use the Preview application to produce the final PNG file.  
You do not need to constrain your palette to web-safe colors. Although you can use alpha transparency in the icons you create for navigation bars, toolbars, and tab bars, do not use it in application icons.
