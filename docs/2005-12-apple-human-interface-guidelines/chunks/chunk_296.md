- Can have the behavior of other types of buttons, including radio buttons or checkboxes  
Don't use metal buttons in dialogs. Dialogs should never use the brushed metal look. See ["Brushed](#page-180-0) [Metal Windows "](#page-180-0) (page 181) for guidelines on when to use brushed metal windows.  
If a button acts on a single setting, label the button as specifically as possible.
