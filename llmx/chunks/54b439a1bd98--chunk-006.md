Users want to feel that they are in charge of the computer's activities.  
People expect their physical actions to have physical results, and they want their tools to provide feedback. For example, when character keys are pressed, users like to hear a click as they see the corresponding characters appear on the screen. When a drawing tool is moved, a line appears. This is true whether or not a computer is being used. Moving a document from one folder or disk to another, or into the trash, can seem to be a physical activity with physical feedback in the computer world as it is in the paper world. The physical activity of moving the mouse reinforces the sense of an action with a real result.  
Users want topics of interest to be highlighted. They want to see what functions are available at any given moment. If grave consequences might follow from any of those functions, they want to know about them—before any damage is done. They want clues that tell them that a particular command is being carried out, or, if it cannot be carried out, they want to know why not and what they can do instead.  
People appreciate visual effects, such as animation, that show that a requested action is being carried out. This is why, when a window is closed, it appears to shrink into a folder or icon. Visual effects can also add entertainment and excitement to programs that might otherwise seem dull. Why shouldn't using a computer be fun?
