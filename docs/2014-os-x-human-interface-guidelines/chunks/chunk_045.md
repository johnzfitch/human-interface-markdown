It's useful to create scenarios that each describe a typical day of a person who might use your app. Think about the different environments, tools, and constraintsthat these people deal with. If possible, visit actual workplaces and study how people perform the tasks that you want your product to help them do.  
Throughout the design process, find people who fit your target audience to test your prototypes. Listen to their feedback and try to addresstheir concerns. Develop your product with people and their capabilities—not computers and their capabilities—in mind.  
Recognize that, as an app developer or interface designer, you have a greater wealth of knowledge and a more intricate understanding of your app than your customers are likely to have. Although you should use that knowledge to choose the best default settings or decide the best presentation of information, remember that you are not designing the program for yourself. It is not *your* needs or *your* usage patterns that you are designing for, but those of your (potential) customers.
