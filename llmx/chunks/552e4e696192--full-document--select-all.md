#### Select All

The Select All command highlights every object in the document. In a word processor, Select All selects every character as well as all graphics in the document. This command is useful if a user wants to copy or reformat an entire document.

The Command-A combination is reserved as a keyboard equivalent for the Select All command in the Edit menu. It shouldn't be used for any other purpose.
