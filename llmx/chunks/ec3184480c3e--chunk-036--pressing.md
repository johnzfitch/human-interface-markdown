#### **Pressing**  
The user *presses* an object on-screen by positioning the cursor over it, pressing a mouse button, and holding the button down for a period of time. Although pressing implies clicking (since the mouse button must be released sometime), an object is said to be pressed rather than clicked if releasing the mouse button too soon would cut the action short.  
Control objects that respond to pressing act immediately when the mouse button is pressed. They don't wait for the button to go up.
