Users expect to see their actions on the keyboard and mouse take effect not only in a particular application, but also in a particular window of that application. Each user action is associated with a window by the Window Server and Application Kit. Before acting, the user needs to know which window will be affected-there should be no surprises.  
Since the mouse controls a cursor, it's quite easy for the user to determine which window a mouse action is associated with. It's whatever window the cursor is over. But the keyboard doesn't have a cursor, so there's no natural way to determine where typing will appear.  
The window associated with keyboard actions, the one where typing will appear, is known as the key window. To mark the key window for users, the Application Kit highlights its title bar (by turning it black).  
Key window highlighting is illustrated below.

You can think of the highlighting as a kind of cursor for the keyboard. It shifts from window to window as the key window changes. Key-window status also moves from application to application as the active application changes. Only one window on the screen is marked at a time, and it must be in the active application. There's just one key window per machine and keyboard. Even a system that has two screens, but only one keyboard, has at most one key window.  
**Note:** A window doesn't have to become the key window to receive, and act on, keyboard alternatives. It does, however, have to be in the active application.  
Since the key window belongs to the active application, its black title bar has the secondary effect of helping to show which application is currently active. The key window is the most prominently marked window in the active application, making it "key" in a second sense: It's the main focus of the user's attention on the screen.  
#### **The Main Window**  
The *main window* is the standard window where the user is currently working. It's the focus of user actions carried out in panels and menus. The Find panel, for example, requires the user to supply information by typing it. Since the panel is the destination of the user's keystrokes, it's marked as the key window. But the panel is just an instrument through which users can do work in another window-the main window.  
Whenever a standard window becomes the key window, it also becomes the main window. When key-window status shifts from a standard window to a panel, main-window status remains with the standard window.  
So that users can pick out the main window when it's not the key window, the Application Kit highlights its title bar in dark gray. If the main window is also the key window, it has only the black highlighting of the key window. The following figure illustrates the main window when it's marked as the key window and when it's not.  
A menu command might affect either the key window or the main window, depending on the command. For example, the Paste command can be used to enter text in a Find panel. But the Save command saves the document displayed in the main window, and the Bold command turns the current selection in the main window bold. For this reason, user actions in a panel or menu are associated with both the key window and the main window:  
- An action is first associated with the key window.
- If the key window is a panel and it can't handle the action, the action is next associated with the main window.  
Note that this order of precedence is reflected in the way windows are highlighted: The key window is always marked, but the main window is marked only when it's not the key window.  
The main window is always in the same application as the key window, the active application. It follows the key window as the user's actions shift the focus from window to window and from application to application.
