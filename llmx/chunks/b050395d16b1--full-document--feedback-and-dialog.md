## Feedback and dialog

Keep the user informed.

Provide immediate feedback.

User activities should be simple at any moment, though they may be complex taken together.

To be in charge, the user must be informed. When, for example, the user initiates an operation, immediate feedback confirms that the operation is being carried out, and (eventually) that it's finished. When the application isn't responding to user input because it's processing a different task, the user must be informed of when to expect delays, why, and for how long.

The user must also be kept informed of the progress of an operation: for example, the reason an operation can't be completed at a certain time as well as the fact that it can't.

This communication should be brief, direct, and expressed in the user's vocabulary rather than the programmer's.
