**Incorporate a brand's colors or images in a refined, unobtrusive way**. Branding is most effective when it is subtle and understated. People use your application to get things done or to be entertained; they don't want to feel as if they're being forced to watch an advertisement. For the best user experience, you want to quietly remind users of your identity.  
**Avoid taking space away from the content people care about**. For example, displaying a second, persistent bar at the top of the screen that does nothing but display branding assets means that there's less room for content. Consider other, less intrusive ways to display pervasive branding, such as subtly customizing the background of a screen.  
<span id="page-52-1"></span>The exception to these guidelines is your application icon, which should be completely focused on your brand. Because users see your application icon frequently, it's important to spend some time balancing eye-appeal with brand recognition.
