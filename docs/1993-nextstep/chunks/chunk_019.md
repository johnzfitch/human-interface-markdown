A user interface must meet the needs of both novice and experienced users:  
- For the novice or infrequent user, it must be simple and easy both to learn and to remember. It shouldn't require any relearning after an extended absence from the computer.
- For the more experienced user, it must be fast and efficient. Nothing in the user interface should get in the way or divert the user's attention from the task at hand.  
The challenge is to accommodate both these goals in ways that don't conflict-to combine simplicity with efficiency.  
A graphical (window-based) user interface is well suited to this task. Because graphical objects can be endowed with recognizable features of real objects, users can borrow on their everyday experience when they approach the computer. Graphical buttons work like you'd expect real buttons to work, windows behave much like separate tablets or sheets of paper, sliders and other graphical objects act like their physical counterparts off-screen. The computer becomes less an entirely new world with its own rules, and more an extension of the more familiar world away from the computer screen.  
This not only makes the user interface easier to learn and remember, it also permits operations to be simpler and more straightforward. Picking an option is as easy as flicking a switch. Resizing a window is as direct and simple as pulling on a tab. The same attributes of the user interface that provide simplicity for novice users can also result in efficiency for more expert users.
