<!-- Chunk 52 | Source: 1993 NeXTSTEP User Interface Guidelines - Release 3.pdf | Est. Tokens: 817 -->
In general, the main action associated with an object should be initiated on the basis of a single click, and dragging should perform a click. However, sometimes it's inconvenient for dragging to result in the object's action. There are three possible solutions to this problem:  
- Require that a modifier key be pressed when dragging the object
- Implement the object so that dragging it doesn't perform a click
- Have a click do nothing, and have a double-click perform the object's action  
For the second solution to work (having dragging not perform a click), all of the following must be true:  
- The user gets clear visual feedback as to whether the object is reacting to a click or to dragging, and it's difficult for the user to do the wrong thing. For example, if the user starts to drag the object but then decides to put it back, the action should not be treated as a click.
- The single click's action matches similar uses of a single click elsewhere in the interface.  
• The action initiated by the click doesn't have consequences that the user might want to avoid and that can't easily be stopped or reversed. (This condition is imposed because of the increased possibility that the user might erroneously click while intending to drag.)  
For example, the main action associated with a docked application icon is the activation of the application, but the user can also move the icon by dragging it. Because the user doesn't always want to activate the application when moving its icon, it isn't practical to have both dragging and a single click activate the application.  
The first solution listed above (requiring a modifier key when dragging) isn't appropriate in this case. Moving an icon is a basic, obvious operation, and unmodified dragging is the natural way to accomplish it.  
The second solution (having dragging not perform a click) also doesn't work, mainly because the action (activating an application) has consequences that the user might want to avoid (such as creating windows that cover the user's work) and that can't be reversed until the application is fully started up. Also, having a single click perform the action doesn't match the behavior of application icons in the File Viewer. In the File Viewer, a single click merely selects the application's file. It isn't started up until the user double-clicks it.  
So the only acceptable solution for docked application icons is for double-clicking to start up the application, while single-clicking does nothing.  
An example of where dragging doesn't imply a single click is in the File Viewer shelf. When the user clicks the icon of a folder on the shelf, the File Viewer changes to show the folder's path. However, when the user drags the icon off the shelf, the File Viewer does *not*  perform the click's action-it doesn't change the current path. One of the reasons this solution works is that the shelf differentiates clicking from dragging by having a threshold for dragging. Until the user drags the icon a certain amount, it doesn't move. Once the user has committed to dragging the icon, it can't be clicked. The icon also looks very different when it's clicked (it's highlighted) from when it's dragged (it moves, and a dimmed copy is visible in its old location).
