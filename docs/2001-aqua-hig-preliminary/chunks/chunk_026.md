The Aqua Human Interface Design Principles  
<span id="page-32-4"></span><span id="page-32-0"></span>Menus present lists of items—commands, attributes, or states—from which the user can choose. Menus are based on the interface principle of see-and-point: People don't have to remember command names because they can view all the available options at any time.  
Each application, including the Finder, has its own set of menus. This chapter describes the menu bar and contextual menus, which display when the user clicks an object while pressing the Control key.  
For information about **pop-up menus** and **combination boxes** (pop-up menus that also accept user input), see ["Control Behavior and Appearance" \(page 90\)](#page-89-0).
