#### Mouse actions  
In general, just *moving* the mouse changes nothing except the location, and possibly the shape, of the pointer. Pressing the mouse button indicates the intention to do something, and releasing the button completes the action. Pressing by itself should have no more effect than clicking has—except in well-defined areas, such as scroll arrows, where it has the same effect as repeated clicking.  
The central mouse function is pointing. Other important mouse actions are clicking, double clicking, pressing, and dragging.  
#### Clicking  
Clicking has two components: pushing down on the mouse button and then quickly releasing it while the mouse remains stationary. (If the mouse moves between button down and button up, dragging—not just clicking—is what happens.) Some uses of clicking are: to select an object, to move an insertion point, to turn on a control. The effect of clicking should be immediate and evident. If the function of the click is to cause an action (such as clicking on a button), the selection is made when the button is pressed, and the action takes place when the button is released.  
#### Double clicking  
Double clicking involves a second click that follows immediately after the end of a first click. If the two clicks are close enough to one another in terms of time (as set by the user in the Control Panel) and of screen location, then they constitute a double click.  
Its most common use is as a shortcut way to perform an action. For example, clicking twice on an icon is a faster way to open it than clicking once to select it, then choosing Open from the File menu; clicking twice on a word to select it is faster than dragging through it. Double clicking can also be used to select a larger object than one that can be selected by a single click.  
Double clicking is a shortcut for those users physically able to use it. Double clicking must never be the *only* way to perform a given action. Many novice users, children, and disabled people have a hard time double-clicking.  
Some applications support selection by double clicking and triple clicking. As always with multiple clicks, the second click extends the effect of the first click, and the third click extends the effect of the second click. For example, in a text-oriented application, the first click sets an insertion point, the second click selects the whole word containing the insertion point, and the third click might select the whole sentence or paragraph. In a graphics application, the first click might select a single object, and double- and triple clicks might select successively larger sets of objects.  
Three clicks is probably the practical limit, and even that is difficult for many people. If an application defines the effect only of single and double clicking, a third click should have no effect. If triple clicking is defined, then the fourth click should have no effect.  
#### Pressing  
Pressing means holding the mouse button down for a time while the mouse remains stationary. Pressing on the scroll bar's arrows, for example, causes scrolling until the user releases the mouse button. For certain kinds of objects, pressing on the object has the same effect as clicking it repeatedly. For example, *clicking* a scroll arrow causes a document to scroll one line; *pressing* on a scroll arrow causes the document to scroll continuously until the user releases the mouse button or reaches the end of the document.
