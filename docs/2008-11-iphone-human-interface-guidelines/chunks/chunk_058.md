A **page indicator** displays a dot for each currently open view in an application. From left to right, the dots represent the order in which the views were opened (the leftmost dot representsthe first view). The currently visible view isindicated by a glow on the dot that representsit. Userstap to the left or the right of the glowing dot to view the previous or next open view. Figure 9-6 shows an example of a page indicator.

A page indicator gives users a quick way to see how many views are open and an indication of the order in which they were opened; it does not help users keep track of the steps they took through a hierarchy of views. Because the views in a utility application tend to be peers of each other, a page indicator is sufficient to help users navigate through them. A productivity application that displays hierarchical information, on the other hand, should offer navigation through the elements in the navigation bar (for more on this, see ["Navigation](#page-61-0) Bars" (page 62)).  
Typically, page indicators work well near the bottom edge of the application screen, below the views it contains. This leaves the more important information (the view itself) in the upper part of the screen where users can see it easily. Be sure to vertically center a page indicator between the bottom edge of the view and the bottom edge of the screen.  
Although there is no programmatic limit to the number of dots you can display in a page indicator, be aware that the dots do not shrink or squeeze together as more appear. For example, in portrait orientation, you can display at most 20 dots in a page indicator before clipping occurs. Therefore, you should provide logic in your application to avoid this situation.  
<span id="page-94-0"></span>Although you can hide a page indicator when there is only one open view, the default behavior is to display it.
