## **Browsers and Selection Lists**

Browsers and selection lists are similar-they both let the user select one or more names in a list. A browser shows text data that's organized in a hierarchy, such as:

- Files and folders
- Cities, counties, and states
- The managerial structure of a company

Selection lists look something like a single-level browser. They usually have scrollers, but they don't have to.

See "Selection" in Chapter 3 for information on how users should select items in a browser or scrolling list. In addition to selecting by clicking, a browser or selection list may have an associated text field, which lets the user select by typing. The Save panel, for example, has a text field that helps the user select files in the panel's browser.

If double-clicking an item within a selection list or browser does anything, it should perform the same action as pressing the Return key (that is, the same action as the button marked with the Return symbol).
