A **radio button** is a control that displays a setting that can be either on or off. Each radio button is part of a group in which only one radio button can be on at a time. (The inverse arrangement, in which only one button is off, is also possible, but is not described separately in this book because it is logically equivalent to the normal arrangement.)  
<span id="page-110-0"></span>There are two types of radio buttons. One is a small oval that is empty if it is not selected, or is filled with solid black if it is selected. The oval radio button is labeled to the right with a word or phrase.  
The second type of radio button is a small picture with a border (unless the picture itself has a continuous edge). Typically, several of these picture radio buttons are placed next to each other, and the one that is selected is indicated by a thick border. Figure 3-17 shows some regular radio buttons and some picture radio buttons.  
**Figure 3-17** Only one radio button in a cluster can be selected

An application can use radio buttons to control options, such as the order in which to sort information. An application can also use radio buttons to change the attributes of a selected object, such as the style of a view. In contrast, an application should use a text button or a picture button—never use a radio button—to bring up a slip; to confirm, authorize, cancel, or stop an action; or to initiate a process.  
Radio Buttons **3-17**  
<span id="page-111-0"></span>To operate a radio button the user can tap any part of it, including the text or picture that identifies it. Tapping one button in a cluster turns off whichever button was on before.  
A cluster of radio buttons must contain at least two items. Instead of using a single radio button, use a checkbox (see the next section, "Checkboxes"). At the opposite extreme, a cluster shouldn't contain more than seven radio buttons. A large cluster of radio buttons simply takes up too much space on the screen. Rather than a lot of radio buttons, use a picker (see [Chapter 4, "Pickers"](#page-126-0)).  
A cluster of radio buttons always has the same set of choices. It never changes contents depending on the context. If more than one group of radio buttons is visible at one time, the groups need to be visually separate from each other. Each cluster may have a heading to identify it.  
Radio buttons and cluster headings are usually capitalized like book titles. However, in some contexts it makes more sense to capitalize them like sentences. If the radio button text completes a sentence begun by the label of the radio button cluster, the heading should be capitalized like a sentence and the radio buttons should be all lowercase (except for proper nouns).  
Avoid punctuation in radio buttons and cluster headings. In particular, do not end a cluster heading with a colon. The heading's meaning is clear without the colon.
