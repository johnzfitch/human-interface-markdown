Apple reserves the right to reserve other keyboard equivalents in the future, so be careful about adding your own, and add them *only for frequently used commands.*  
Use the Command key as the main modifier key for keyboard equivalents. For a command that complements another more common command, you can add Shift. The table below shows some recommended keyboard equivalents using Shift.  
**Table 9-8** Some of the recommended keyboard equivalents using Shift to complement other commands  
| Keys             | Command                              | Complemented command   |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Shift-Command-A  | Deselect All                         | Command-A (Select All) |
| Shift-Command-G  | Find Previous                        | Command-G (Find Again) |
| Shift-Command-P  | Page Setup                           | Command-P (Print)      |
| Shift-Command-S  | Save As                              | Command-S (Save)       |
| Shift-Command-V  | Paste as (Quotation, for<br>example) | Command-V (Paste)      |
| Shift-Command-Z* | Redo                                 | Command-Z (Undo)       |  
<sup>\*</sup> This combination would be used only if Undo and Redo are separate commands (rather than toggled using Command-Z).  
If there's a third, less common command that's related to a pair of commands that use Command and Shift-Command, you can use Option-Command for the third command's keyboard equivalent. In the example in Table 9-9, Save All could be a dynamic menu item (see ["Menu Behavior" \(page 49\)](#page-48-0)) that appears in place of Save when the user presses the Option key (rather than a separate menu item). Use combinations like these very rarely.

| Keys             | Command  |
|------------------|----------|
| Command-S        | Save     |
| Shift-Command-S  | Save As  |
| Option-Command-S | Save All |  
The Keyboard **181**  
Also use Option for a keyboard equivalent that is a convenience or power user feature. For example, the Finder uses Option-Command-W for Close All Windows and Option-Command-M for Minimize All Windows.  
Remember that other languages may require modifier keys to generate certain characters. For example, on a French keyboard, you generate the "{" character by pressing Option-5. You can safely modify any character with the Command key, but avoid using Command and an additional modifier with characters not available on all keyboards. If you must use a modifier key in addition to the Command key, use them only with the alphabetic characters (*a* through *z*).
