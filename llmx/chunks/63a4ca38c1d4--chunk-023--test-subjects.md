#### Test subjects  
There is no such thing as a "typical user." You should, however, be able to identify some people who are familiar with the task your application supports but are unfamiliar with the specific technology you are using. These "naive experts" make good subjects because they don't have to be taught what the application is for, they are probably already motivated to use it,and they know what they need to accomplish the task.  
You don't need to test a lot of people. The best procedure for formative testing (testing during the design process) is to collect data from a few subjects, analyze the results, and apply them as appropriate. Then, identify new questions that arise and questions that still need answers, and begin all over again—it is an iterative process.
