As described above, under "Types of Applications", an array is a oneor two-dimensional arrangement of fields. If the array is one-dimensional, it's called a form; if it's two-dimensional, it's called a table. The user can select one or more fields, or part of the contents of a field.  
To select a single field, the user clicks in the field. The user can also implicitly select a field by moving into it with the Tab or Return key.
