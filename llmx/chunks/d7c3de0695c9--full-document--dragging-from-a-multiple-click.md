## **Dragging from a Multiple-Click**

The act of pressing a mouse button to initiate dragging can be part (the last part) of a double-click or triple-click. If the user doesn't immediately release the mouse button and begins dragging at the end of a multiple-click, the dragging action can be assigned a meaning that's related to the meaning of the multiple-click.

For example, double-clicking selects a word in editable text, and dragging from a double-click selects additional words within a range of text. If triple-clicking selects a line, dragging from a triple-click will select additional lines within the range.
