<!-- Chunk 173 | Source: 1996 Newton 2.0 User Interface Guidelines.pdf | Est. Tokens: 157 -->
Your application does not have to do anything to handle alarms that a user does not acknowledge. If a user is away from his or her Newton when an alarm goes off and the Newton goes back to sleep before the user returns, the user won't know the alarm went off until powering up the Newton again. The Newton system's Persistent Alarms user preference solves this problem. When this preference is enabled, the system reschedules alarms until the user acknowledges them. To conserve battery power, the length of time between reappearances of a particular alarm increases in proportion to the number of times it has gone unacknowledged.
