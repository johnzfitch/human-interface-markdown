The **menu bar** extends across the top of the main screen and contains the current app's menus, among other items. The location of the menu bar is always the same, but users can change its opacity and, under some circumstances, the menu bar can be hidden.  
The system, the active app, and the user define the items that appear in the menu bar. For example, when the Finder is active, the Finder menus are in the left of the menu bar and some user-specified items are in the right.

The menu bar always contains:  
- The Apple menu at the far left end (provided by the operating system)
- The Spotlight icon at the far right end (provided by the operating system)
- The app menu (titled with the active app's name or an appropriate abbreviation if space is limited)
- A Window menu  
In addition, the menu bar might contain the following menus, if they make sense in the active app:  
- A File menu
- An Edit menu
- A Format menu
- A View menu
- A Help menu
- Additional app-specific menus  
Finally, users can specify **menu bar extras**, which are items such as date and time, battery charge, and current locale, that are displayed in the right end of the menu bar.  
**Note:** If there isn't enough room to display all of the active app's menus, OS X can omit some menu bar extras. If there is still insufficient room to display all menus, some of the app's menus may be omitted, starting with the rightmost menu.  
All apps put their menus in the menu bar; they never provide a bar of menus within a window. This ensures that users always know where to look for app commands. To learn more about how menus behave, see ["Menu](#page-132-0) [Appearance](#page-132-0) and Behavior" (page 133).  
The menu bar is always visible, except in specific, temporary circumstances. For example, during a slideshow or as an option when a window is full screen, the menu bar can be hidden. If the menu bar is hidden, users can reveal it by moving the pointer to the upper edge of the screen. In rare circumstances, such as when users view Time Machine backups or browse earlier versions of a document, the menu bar is unavailable until users finish the task.
