# Visual consistency

The purpose of visual consistency is to construct a *believable environment* for users. Because such concepts as storing documents in folders and throwing things away in the trash can are the same in both the real world and in the Apple Desktop environment, users don't have to re-learn them in order to begin work. This transfer of skills is one of the most important benefits of a consistent interface, especially for beginning users.

Photographic realism isn't essential; the important thing is that the user gets the intended meaning. A well-designed symbol or caricature can convey meaning better then a completely realistic picture.

If images don't efficiently convey meaning, the user is lost in an environment of random objects, and communication breaks down. Graphics—the icons, windows, dialog boxes, and so on—are the basis of effective human-computer dialog and must be designed with this in mind.
