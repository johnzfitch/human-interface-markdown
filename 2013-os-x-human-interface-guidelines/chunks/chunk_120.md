A **scope bar** allows usersto specify locations or rulesin a search or to filter objects by specific criteria. In general, scope bars are not visible all the time, but appear when the user initiates a search or similar operation. For example, the figure below shows the scope bar Safari displays when the user performs a find.

**Use a scope bar to help users specify and narrow a search, or to filter items.** You might provide a scope bar if you want users to be able to specify and refine a search while maintaing their focus in the window. If you need to give users a way to navigate or to select collections of items or data that should appear in the window, however, you should use a source list instead (described in ["Providing](#page-187-0) a Source List" (page 188)). For example, the Dictionary app uses a scope bar to allow users to dynamically filter results by reference type (such as dictionary, thesaurus, or Apple dictionary), as shown below.

**If appropriate, allow users to refine a scoping operation.** Users can specify additional rules to refine their scoping operation in filter rows that appear below a scope bar. A filter row can contain text fields that accept user input and round rectangle–style scope buttons(used forselecting orsaving scoping criteria). For example, when users search in the Finder, they can click the Add button to view a new filter row with supplementary rules they can use to refine their search, as shown below.

**Use the appropriate controls in a scope bar.** In addition to the search field control, you should only use the controlsthat are specifically designed for use in a scope bar. These controls are the recessed-style scope button and the round rectangle–style scope button. The recessed-style scope button can display scoping locations and categories and the round rectangle–style scope button allows users to save or manipulate a scoping operation. To learn more about these controls, see "Scope [Button"](#page-245-0) (page 246).  
**Allow users to save their searches.** Users appreciate being able to perform specific searches again, especially if they spent time defining (and refining) a useful search.
