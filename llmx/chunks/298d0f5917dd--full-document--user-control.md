## User Control

Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. People learn best when they're actively engaged. Too often, however, the computer acts and the user merely reacts within a limited set of options. In other instances, the computer "takes care" of the user, offering only those alternatives that are judged "good" for the user or that "protect" the user from having to make detailed decisions. This approach mistakenly puts the computer, not the user, in control.

The key is to create a balance between providing users with the capabilities they need to get their work done and preventing them from destroying data. For situations in which a user may destroy data accidentally, you can help the user by providing warnings, usually in the form of an alert box, to notify users of a potentially undesirable situation and still allow them to proceed, if they confirm that this is what they want. This approach "protects" users but allows them to remain in control.
