In general, each command in the **File menu** should apply to a single file (most commonly, a user-created document).  
Note that the Preferences and Quit commands, which apply to a whole application, are in the application menu. If your application provides document-specific preferences, make them available in the File menu, preferably right above printing commands. If an application is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate or eliminate it.  
Several items in the File menu—Save As, Print, and Page Setup, for example should open sheets. For more information, see ["Document-Modal Dialogs \(Sheets\)"](#page-95-0) [\(page 96\).](#page-95-0)
