A **picture button** is a small picture (an icon) that represents the button's function. The picture is usually bordered by a rounded rectangle, like a text button with a picture instead of a text name. Figure 3-7 shows several picture buttons.

A picture button should be as tall as the large Close box (described under ["Close Boxes" beginning on page 3-14](#page-107-0)) and wide enough to enclose the picture. Leave white space between the picture and the interior edge of the button border. On an Apple MessagePad, make picture buttons with borders 13 pixels tall (not counting the 2-pixel black border), and leave at least one pixel of white space between the picture and the border.  
Picture buttons on a status bar definitely need bordering rectangles to match the other items there and to isolate the pictures from the bar. Conversely, picture buttons on separator bars do not touch the bar and often look better without bordering rectangles. For example, the Filing button and Action button must have a border when they are on a status bar, but look better without a border on a separator bar. A button looks good without a border if

its picture has an unbroken line around it—a sort of self-border. Figure 3-8 shows where you should omit picture button borders and where you should keep the borders.

#### Designing Picture Buttons 3  
Picture buttons are tempting to use because they are more compact than text buttons. But designing an unambiguous picture small enough for a picture button is very hard. A button's function may be more evident if you label it with a short name instead of a picture.  
Avoid pictures that look like the buttons of other applications, such as Names and Dates. Users may think your look-alike button will open the corresponding built-in application, and may be confused if your buttons do something else.
