A segmented control can contain either icons or text, but not a mixture of both. However, when the control contains icons, you can place a text label below the control.  
For the text in each segment, or the label below it, use a noun (or short noun phrase) that describes a view or an object, and use title-style capitalization (see ["Capitalization](#page-130-1) of Interface Element Labels and Text" (page 131) for more on this style).  
If you choose to use icons in a segmented control, be sure to consider using the images that are available in Mac OS X v10.5 and later (see ["System-Provided](#page-150-0) Images" (page 151) for more information on these). If you need to design your own images, try to imitate the clarity and simple lines of the system-provided images.
