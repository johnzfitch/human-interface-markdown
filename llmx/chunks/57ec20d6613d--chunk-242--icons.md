#### Icons  
Apple provides standard balloons for icons. If you wish, you can provide your own balloons for your application and its associated special files, but don't provide balloons for your application's document icons.  
You don't need to describe how to open icons; you can assume that Macintosh users know how. Figure 11-16 shows the standard help balloons for an application icon and a document icon.
