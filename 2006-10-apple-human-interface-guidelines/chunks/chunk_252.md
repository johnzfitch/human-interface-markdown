A **sheet** is a modal dialog attached to a particular document or window, ensuring that the user never loses track of which window the dialog applies to. Because a sheet is attached to the window from which it emerges, a sheet does not have its own title.  
The ability to keep a dialog attached to its pertinent window helps users take full advantage of the Mac OS X window layering model (see "Window [Layering"](#page-195-1) (page 196)). Sheets also allow users to perform other tasks before dismissing the dialog, with no sense of the system being "hijacked" by the application.

**Carbon:** You are responsible for creating, showing, handling the events for, and closing sheets. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when the sheet appears and is dismissed, is handled automatically by the Window Manager.  
**Cocoa:** You are responsible for loading, showing, and closing sheets. While a sheet is displayed, events are handled by the Application Kit just as for any other window. Other sheet behavior, such as the animation when the sheet appears and is dismissed, is handled automatically by the Application Kit.  
#### **Sheet Behavior**  
Sheets are displayed as an animation that appears to emerge from the window's title bar. When a sheet opens on a window near the edge of the screen and the sheet is wider than the window it's attached to, the sheet moves thewindowawayfrom the edge;when the sheet is dismissed, thewindow returns to its previous position.  
Only one sheet may be open for a window at any one time. A sheet prevents any other operation on that window until the sheet is dismissed. If, when the user responds to a sheet, another sheet for that document must open, the first sheet closes before the second one opens.  
<span id="page-208-1"></span>A sheet on an active document window should cover (appear on top of) any active utility windows (if necessary). However, if the user leaves a sheet open and clicks another document in the same application, the inactive window and its sheet should go *behind* any open utility windows.  
In an application that allows multiple windows for the same document (so that the user can see different parts of a document simultaneously), a sheet is not appropriate. Use an application modal dialog in this situation to make it clear that changes to one window affect other windows in the application.  
<span id="page-208-0"></span>In an application that displays multiple documents in a single window at different times, such as in a tabbed browser, a sheet is appropriate even though it applies to only the current document in the view. This is because, in a single-window situation, the user can't move the view and its sheet aside to handle later when choosing to view a different document. Rather, the user in effect dismisses the view's contents when choosing to view a different document. The user should therefore dismiss the sheet on the current view before selecting a different document.
