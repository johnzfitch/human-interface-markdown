Use the large iPad screen and iPad-specific UI elements to give people access to more information in one place. Although you don't want to pack too much information into one screen, you also want to prevent people from feeling that they must visit many different screens to find what they want.  
**In general, focus the main screen on the primary content** and provide additional information or tools in an auxiliary view, such as a popover. This gives people easy access to the functionality they need, without requiring them to leave the context of the main task.  
With the large iPad screen, and UI elements such as a split view and popovers, you have alternatives to the one-level-per-screen structure of many iPhone applications. (For specific guidelines on how to use these elements, see "Split View (iPad [Only\)"](#page-104-0) (page 105) and ["Popover](#page-102-1) (iPad Only)" (page 103).)  
**Use a navigation bar in the right pane of a split view** to allow people to drill down into a top-level category that is persistently displayed in the left pane. A **split view** flattens your information hierarchy by at least one level, because two levels are always onscreen at the same time. For example, Settings displays device and application settings using a navigation bar in the right pane of a split view.

**Use a navigation bar in the left pane of a split view** to allow people to drill down through a fairly shallow hierarchy. Then, display the most specific information (that is, the leaf nodes in the hierarchy) in the right pane. This, too, flattens your hierarchy by displaying two levels onscreen at one time. For example, Mail in landscape uses this design to display the hierarchy of accounts, mailboxes, and message lists in the left pane, and individual messages in the right pane.

**Use a popover** to enable actions or provide tools that affect onscreen objects. A popover can display these actions and tools temporarily on top of the current screen, which means people don't have to transition to another screen to get them. For example, Mail in portrait orientation uses a popover to display the account, mailbox, and message list hierarchy.

**Use a segmented control in a toolbar**to display different perspectives on the content or different information categories. In this way, you can provide access to these perspectives or categories from a single bar at the top (or the bottom) of the screen. (For usage guidelines, see ["Toolbar"](#page-99-0) (page 100) and ["Segmented](#page-99-1) [Control"](#page-99-1) (page 100).) For example, iTunes uses a segmented control in a top-edge toolbar to provide different perspectives on the content in a category.

**Use a tab bar** to display different information categories or, less often, different application modes. In iPad applications, a tab bar is more likely to be used as a filter or category switcher than as a mode switcher. For example, iTunes uses a tab bar to give people access to different categories of media.

When possible, avoid using a tab bar to swap in completely different screens, because it's best to reduce full-screen transitions on iPad.
