A Recognizer button lets users control the system's recognition of handwriting and drawing. An application's main view should have a Recognizer button to the right of the Info button on its status bar if users can write or draw in the main view. Additionally, a Recognizer button can go in the lower left corner of each slip in which users can write or draw. Figure 3-24 shows a Recognizer button on a status bar and one in a slip.

The Recognizer button is a picture button, and the picture on the button indicates the type of recognition currently in effect. Figure 3-25 shows how the Recognizer button looks for each type of recognition.
