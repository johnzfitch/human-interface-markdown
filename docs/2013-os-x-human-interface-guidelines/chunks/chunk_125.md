Most windows display a title, whether it's the name of the app, the name of a document, or the name of a specific type of functionality, such as Inspector. A window's title helps users instantly identify the window and its contents. Follow the guidelines in this section as you name new windows that users can open in your app.  
**Use your app name for the title of a main, nondocument window.** If your app has a short name, use it as the title (for more information about the short name, see "The App [Menu"](#page-144-0) (page 145)).  
**Name a new document window "untitled."** Leave "untitled" lowercase to make it more obvious that the window contains untitled content. Don't put a "1" on the first untitled window, even after the user opens other new windows.  
If the user chooses New again before titling the first untitled document window, name the second window "untitled 2," and so on.

If the user dismisses all untitled windows, the next new document window they open should start over as "untitled," the next should be "untitled 2," and so on.
