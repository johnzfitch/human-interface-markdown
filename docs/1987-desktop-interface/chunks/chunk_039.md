In the standard interface part of applications (menus, window frames, and so on), color should be used minimally or not at all; the Desktop Interface is very successful in black and white. You want the user's attention focused on the content of the application, rather than distracted by color in the menus or scroll bars. Use of color in the content area of your application depends on what the application is for.  
Graphics applications, which are concerned with the image itself, should take full advantage of the color capabilities of Color QuickDraw, letting the user choose from and modify as many colors as are available.  
Other applications, which deal with the organization of information, should limit the use of color much more than this. Color coding should be allowed or provided to make the information clearer. Providing the user with <sup>a</sup> small initial selection of distinct colors—four to seven at most—with the capability of changing those available, or adding more, is the best solution.
