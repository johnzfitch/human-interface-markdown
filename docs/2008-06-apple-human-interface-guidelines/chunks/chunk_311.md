A **push button** performs an instantaneous action,such assaving a document, completing operations defined by a dialog, or acknowledging an error message. Push buttons are designed for use in the window body only, not in the window-frame areas (for more information about these window parts, see ["Window](#page-189-0) [Elements"](#page-189-0) (page 190)). Figure 15-7 shows several different usages of the push button.
