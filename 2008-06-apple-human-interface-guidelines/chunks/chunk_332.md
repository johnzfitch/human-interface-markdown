<span id="page-268-2"></span><span id="page-268-1"></span>A **bevel button** is a multipurpose button designed for use in the window-body area. You can use bevel buttons singly (as a push button) or in groups (as a set of radio buttons or checkboxes). Figure 15-17 shows bevel buttons used as push buttons in the Preview inspector window.

Bevel buttons can have square or rounded corners. The square-cornered variation can be used when space is limited or when adjoining a set of bevel buttons. You may notice, however, that bevel buttons are not very frequently used in applications running in Mac OS X v10.4 and later. This is due in part to user interface style changes and in part to alternative controls that became available. You can still use bevel buttons if they provide exactly the look you need, but you should consider alternatives, such as gradient buttons and segmented controls (described in ["Gradient](#page-264-0) Buttons" (page 265) and ["Segmented](#page-276-0) Controls" (page 277), respectively).
