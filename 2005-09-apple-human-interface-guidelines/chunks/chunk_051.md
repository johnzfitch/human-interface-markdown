People rely on the standard Mac OS X user interface for a consistent, predictable user experience. Don't copy other platforms' user interface elements or behaviors in Mac OS X, because they may confuse users who aren't familiar with them.  
If you need to extend the interface of Mac OS X, the best place to begin is with the already defined visual and behavioral language. Thinkaboutwhat the appearance communicates to people (the look) and how they expect the element to behave (the feel).  
Visual cues, such as the arrow on a pop-up menu, help people recognize familiar elements. People learn to associate certain behaviors with specific elements based on their appearance. For example, people recognize push buttons by their rounded shape and look for a label that identifies the action the button causes. This particular appearance distinguishes a push button from othertypes of elements. When people clicka button, theyexpect it to be highlighted to indicate that the action tookeffect, and they expect the action to take effect immediately. People may also expect that clicking a button will have additional behaviors related to it, such as dismissing a dialog or changing the content area of the active document.
