If the Assistant can't interpret a user's written request, the Assistant displays an Assist slip where the user can provide more information. The user can choose an action from the Assist slip's Please picker and can write on the slip's input line. If a user wrote some words before tapping the Assist button but did not write enough to clearly specify an action, the Assist slip displays those words and includes a message prompting the user to provide additional information. For example, if a user just wrote "Bob," the Assistant could perform a number of actions: it could find Bob, fax Bob, call Bob, schedule a meeting with Bob, and so on. [Figure 8-23](#page-266-0) shows examples of Assist slips with too few words and with no words.

An Assist slip's Please picker lists the actions that applications have currently registered with it, as well as eight phrases the Assistant has tried to interpret recently. [Figure 8-24](#page-267-0) shows a sample Please picker.

The built-in tasks that the Assistant lists in the Please picker include calling, faxing, finding, mailing, printing, remembering To Do items, scheduling meetings, and getting time information from the Time Zones application. If your application registers additional actions with the Assistant, they automatically appear in the Please picker. Note that the top portion of this picker displays only one word for each action. If the Assistant knows synonyms for an action, they do not appear in the top portion of the Please picker. For example, the word "call" appears but the synonyms "ring" and "phone" do not. Recently used synonyms may appear in the bottom half of the picker, however.  
If a user writes a verb the Assistant doesn't know, it may be able to deduce a likely action from other words. For example, if a user writes the phrase "buzz 555-1234" the Assistant does not match the word "buzz" to an action, but it can identify "555-1234" as having the format of a telephone number. Based on that information, the Assistant deduces the user wants to call, fax, or find the phone number, and it lists only those actions in the Please picker.  
<span id="page-268-0"></span>In addition to the Please picker and an input line, an Assist slip has a How Do I? button in the lower left corner for accessing the Newton online help service (see ["Help" on page 8-28](#page-269-0)). In the lower right corner of an Assist slip are a Do button for initiating the action specified in the slip and a large Close box for canceling the action.  
The primary function of an Assist slip is to specify an action. If the Assistant can determine an action to take based on words a user writes or selects before tapping the Assist button, then the Assistant does not display an Assist slip. Once the Assistant knows what action to take, it can resolve other missing or ambiguous information with a task slip.
