#### **Keycap Names**  
Whenever possible, call keys by the names printed on them, written out in full. Three of the keys do have a standard abbreviation:  
| First choice | Second choice | Abbreviation (last choice) |
|--------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| ð            | OPEN-APPLE    | OA                         |
|              | SOLID-APPLE   | SA                         |
| CONTROL      | CONTROL       | CTRL                       |  
The Apple II and Apple II Plus have CTRL printed on the CONTROL key and should therefore be prompted by "CTRL" as a first choice. (However, the Apple IIe has CONTROL spelled out on the CONTROL key.) Foreign-language keyboards have various special symbols for shift, caps lock, tab and return; use the "local" character in each "local" version where possible.
