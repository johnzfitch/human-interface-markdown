Windows have different looks based on how the user is interacting with them. The foremost document or application window that is the focus of the user's attention is referred to as the **main window**. The main window is often also the **key window**. The key window is the window that accepts user input, whether from the keyboard, mouse, or alternative input device. The "close window" keyboard shortcut, Command-W, targets the key window.  
However, the main window is not always the key window. There are times when a window other than the main window takes the focus of the input device, while the main window still remains the focus of the user's attention. For example, when a person is using an inspector, a Find dialog, or the Fonts or Colors windows, the document is the main window and the other window is the key window.  
If the main and key window are different windows, they are distinguished from one another by the look of their title bars (and toolbars, if they are present). In particular, note that the key window displays title-bar controls with color.  
Main and key windows are both active windows. An active window is visually distinct from an **inactive window** in that its title bar (and its toolbar, if there is one) displays the standard window-frame color, while the title bar (and toolbar) of an inactive window displays a lighter shade of the window-frame color. Inactive windows are windows the user has open, but that are not in the foreground. Main and key windows are always in the foreground, but only the controls of the key window have color. An active window that is not key has active, but clear, controls.  
**Note:** A transparent panel that is key displays a subtly reflective title bar and a white title, whereas a non-key transparent panel displays a darker title bar and a light gray title. See ["Transparent](#page-224-0) Panels" (page 225) for more information about transparent panels.
