The items in a list picker should be logically related to each other and to the label, button, or whatever else controls the picker. Arrange the items in a list picker in an order that makes sense and is most convenient to users. In general, start the list with the items most likely to be picked and end the list with the items least likely to be picked. If all items are equally likely to be picked, or if you want to arrange them without prejudice or bias, list them alphabetically.  
You can organize a list picker visually, making it easier to locate an item by grouping related items. In a picker that contains several types of items actions, attributes, values, and states—group the items according to type. In a picker that contains a single type of item, look for another criterion. For instance, the Printer picker in a Print routing slip lists specific printers in one group and commands that access other printers in a second group. The Look For picker in the Find slip has two groups: one for finding text and another for dates.  
You put a separator line between groups of items in a list picker. How many separator lines to use is partially an aesthetic decision. Remember that separator lines take up screen space and that the Newton interface relies on aesthetic integrity as a means of good communication. [Figure 4-4](#page-132-0) contrasts a good balance of grouping with too little grouping and too much grouping.

For general grouping of items in a picker, you should only use a dotted separator line, never a solid separator line. The solid separator line is reserved for setting apart choices related to storage, such as the names of available card stores and the internal store, at the bottom of a picker (see ["Folder Tab" on page 8-19](#page-260-0)).
