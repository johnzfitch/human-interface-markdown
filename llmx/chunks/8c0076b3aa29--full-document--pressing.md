#### Pressing

Pressing means holding the mouse button down for a time while the mouse remains stationary. Pressing on the scroll bar's arrows, for example, causes scrolling until the user releases the mouse button. For certain kinds of objects, pressing on the object has the same effect as clicking it repeatedly. For example, *clicking* a scroll arrow causes a document to scroll one line; *pressing* on a scroll arrow causes the document to scroll continuously until the user releases the mouse button or reaches the end of the document.
