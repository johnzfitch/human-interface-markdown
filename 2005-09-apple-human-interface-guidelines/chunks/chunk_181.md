<span id="page-128-2"></span>The concept behind toolbars is that they provide access to items as if they were sitting on a shelf in front ofyou. Toolbars should conserve screen real estatewhile still beinginvitingand easilyclickable; 32 pixels by 32 pixels is the recommended size for toolbar icons.

<span id="page-128-3"></span>Each toolbar icon should be easily and quickly distinguishable from the other items in the toolbar. Toolbar icons emphasize their outline form, rather than subtler visual details. As shown in Figure 10-15, each Finder toolbar icon's shape is unique.

Note that although each Finder toolbar icon has a unique shape, the icons harmonize together in their perspective, use of color, size, and visual weight.  
Although icons designed specifically for use in a toolbar appear as if they are sitting on a shelf in front of you, if you place a very recognizable object from elsewhere in the interface in a toolbar, the object should retain its perspective. That is, don't redesign a toolbar version of awell-known interface element.

Creating a family of toolbar icons helps make an application recognizable and unique. Mail, for example, uses blue and white as dominant colors in its toolbar icons. You can start with a consistent "look"when it makes sense, and introduce differenceswhen necessary. In the Mail application toolbar, for example, the Reply, Reply All, Forward, and Bounce buttons—all for actions the user can apply to a selected received message—use a stamp as the dominant symbol. Because the Bounce button is potentially destructive (the user can no longer read the bounced message), its icon is red. The pencil is depicted in recognizable and realistic yellow.
