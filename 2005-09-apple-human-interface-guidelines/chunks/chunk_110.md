In text-oriented applications, the Tab key moves the insertion point to the next tab stop. In other contexts, Tab is a signal to proceed; it means "move to the next item in a sequence."

For more details about navigating with the Tab key, see "Keyboard Focus and [Navigation](#page-98-0) " (page 99).
