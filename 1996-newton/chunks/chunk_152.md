The Out Box holds data items coming from all applications and waiting to be printed, faxed, beamed, e-mailed, or sent by other Newton transport software. Items in the Out Box stay there until a user physically connects the Newton to a suitable output device and chooses to send the items. For example, a user may choose to fax and e-mail several items while aboard an airplane. Those items go into the Out Box and wait until the user connects the Newton to a fax modem and a phone line and sends the items.  
Users can view many types of outgoing items while the items are still in the Out Box. In addition, users can change the content, routing, or addressing of some items in the Out Box. For example, a user could direct a printed item to a different printer, edit the text of an e-mail message, or change a fax number.  
Users can also send some Out Box items directly from the Out Box. For example, if the Out Box contains a fax waiting to be sent, a user can also print the waiting fax directly from the Out Box.  
A transport can be designed to connect and transfer out data items a user sends to it as soon as those data items appear in the Out Box. For example, a transport for wireless communications could automatically transfer out items as soon as a user sent them from an application, without the user having to open the Out Box.
