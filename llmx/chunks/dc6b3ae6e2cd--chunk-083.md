The menu bar is displayed at the top of the screen. It contains a number of words and phrases: These are the titles of the menus associated with the current application. Each application has its own menu bar. The names of the menus do not change, except when the user calls for a desk accessory that uses different menus.  
Only menu titles appear in the menu bar. If all of the commands in a menu are currently disabled (that is, the user can't choose them), the menu title should be dimmed (in gray type or flanked by the ASCII 127 checkerboard). The user can pull down the menu to see the commands, but can't choose any of them.
