The human interface is an illusion: the pattern of light and darkness that your user perceives as "real" on the display is a careful contrivance of you, its creator. The quality of the human interface can often be measured by nothing more than the effectiveness of the chosen illusion.  
Visicalc (TM) was the first serious microcomputer program that depended on a metaphorical illusion. The user was operating on a giant, classical business spreadsheet, seen through the limiting viewport of the monitor. The user could move the viewport around to see parts of the spreadsheet that were currently hidden. This illusion was particularly effective: it was familiar  
effort to be as comfortable as possible. (Armed with hindsight, one can argue that the target audience went far beyond the halls of the business schools, and that spreadsheets are not familiar to the typical user of these programs. But this unexpected success should not detract from the fact that the program conformed to the old knowledge and expectations of its original target audience.)
