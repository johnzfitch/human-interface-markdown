A **static text field** displays text that can't be modified by the user.  
**API Note:** To define a static text field in your code, use the NSTextField class. (In Interface Builder, a static text field is called a label.)  
Static text fields have two states: active and dimmed.  
<span id="page-212-2"></span>**Make static text selectable when it provides an obvious user benefit.** For example, a user should be able to copy an error message, a serial number, or an IP address to paste elsewhere.
