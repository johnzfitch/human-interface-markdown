Use smaller versions of controls only when necessary. Your first choice in designing for Aqua should always be to use the full-size controls.  
<span id="page-292-1"></span>You can use the smaller versions of controls when space is at a premium, such as in tool palettes, other utility windows, or Automator actions (for more information on Automator, see ["Automator"](#page-61-0) (page 62)). Avoid mixing different sizes of controls in the same window. In a window with a changeable pane, it is acceptable to use small or mini controls within the pane and standard controls outside the pane. However, all panes of a window should use controls of the same size.
