Navigation is a necessity in both webpages and iPhone web applications. The combination of the way users interact with iPhone and the size of the iPhone screen makes easy, accurate navigation essential.  
In accordance with webpage design best practices and the principles of simplicity and focus (described in ["Simplicity](#page-20-1) and Ease of Use" (page 21) and ["Focus"](#page-24-1) (page 25)), you should avoid requiring users to move through too many pagesto get to what they're interested in. Tapping too many times on iPhone is as annoying as clicking too many times in a desktop browser. It is also irritating if your webpage requires users to pan to a different location on the page to reveal the control that takes them to the next page.  
Safari on iPhone, like Safari on the desktop, provides a back button (it's the left-pointing arrow on the left end of the button bar, as shown in [Figure](#page-33-0) 4-5 (page 34)). When users tap this back button, Safari on iPhone opens the previously visited URL. Under certain circumstances, this behavior may present a problem. For example, if your webpage or iPhone web application preserves its own context and displays different pages with a single URL, users may assume that tapping the Safari on iPhone back button will return them to the previously viewed page, when in fact it returns them to the previously viewed website. This is an especially important problem for iPhone web applications to solve, because an iPhone web application strives to emphasize its similarities to built-in iPhone applications and to downplay the fact that it is a web application viewed in Safari on iPhone.  
If you're developing an iPhone web application or if your webpage maintainsits own context, you can address this issue by designing a custom control that helps users navigate your content, as described next.  
**Important:** This is *not* a recommendation to design another back button; providing redundant controls is a user interface design error.  
To enable custom navigation, follow these steps:  
- On each page, including the first page, clearly and succinctly title each link to a subsequent page. If possible, use a one-word title.
- Be sure the title of each subsequent page is identical to the title you used in the text that links to it.
- Add a custom navigational control to the upper-left corner of every page except the first page, and label it with the title of the page the user visited previously.  
<span id="page-45-1"></span>When users move from one page to another, they can easily return to the previous page because your custom navigational control always displays the title of the previous page. Figure 4-16 shows how this looks in a few pages of the built-in Settings application.

<span id="page-45-0"></span>Providing a custom navigational control encourages users to ignore the built-in button bar while they are in your application, decreasing the possibility that they will mistakenly tap the Safari on iPhone back button and strengthening the feeling that they are using a standalone application. The built-in iPhone applications use this method to good effect, which means that users are already accustomed to it.
