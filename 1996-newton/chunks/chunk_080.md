**Checkboxes,** like radio buttons, provide alternative choices for users. A checkbox is a small dotted box that may include a check mark (✔). It is labeled to the right or left with a word or phrase. Use a checkbox to indicate an option that must be either off or on.  
The user selects or deselects the checkbox by tapping it or its label. When the option is selected, a check mark appears in the box. When the option is not selected, the box is empty. Checkboxes act like toggle switches, which can be on or off. A checkbox is on when it is selected and off when it is not selected. [Figure 3-18](#page-112-0) shows some typical checkboxes.

You can have one checkbox or as many as you need. Checkboxes are independent of one another, even when they offer related options. Any number of checkboxes can be on or off at the same time. It's a good idea to group sets of checkboxes that are related, and to separate the groups from other groups of checkboxes and radio buttons. Each group may have a heading to identify it.  
Labeling a checkbox unambiguously can be difficult. The label should imply two clearly opposite states. For example, the Sound preferences slip (Figure 3-18) shows a checkbox labeled "Action sound effects" that controls whether or not sound effects are played for actions. If the checkbox is selected, the action sound effects are played. The clearly opposite state, when the checkbox is not selected, is to not play action sound effects.  
Checkboxes are usually capitalized like sentences. However, in some contexts it makes more sense to capitalize them like book titles. Checkbox labels should be all lowercase (except for proper nouns) if the checkboxes are part of a group and each label completes a sentence begun by the label of the group.  
If you can't think of a label for a checkbox that clearly implies its opposite state, you might be better off using radio buttons. With radio buttons, you can use two labels, thereby clarifying the states. It's sometimes tempting to use a checkbox because one item takes up less space than two. However, the resulting item may be ambiguous and thus difficult to understand.  
Sometimes using one checkbox instead of two radio buttons can make users focus more carefully on a choice between two states. One state is clearly labeled, but a user must think to figure out the unlabeled state. While thinking,

<span id="page-113-0"></span>the user may briefly ponder the significance of changing the checkbox's state. For example, a checkbox in a fax routing slip lets a user select fine resolution or not. This option could be implemented with two radio buttons, perhaps labeled "Fine" and "Standard." A user is more likely to think about all the ramifications of the choice with a checkbox than with two radio buttons. Figure 3-19 illustrates the two approaches.

You can use checkboxes to control options and set attributes in your application. But use a text button or picture button, not a checkbox, to bring up a slip; to confirm, authorize, cancel, or stop an action; or to initiate a process.
