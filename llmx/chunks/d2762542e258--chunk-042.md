Displays with several input statements:  
- \* Movement from input to input is sequential: the user may move back and forth but not randomly skip around. (The exception is the spreadsheet sort of array, where the user can use the four arrow keys.)
- \* Pressing the Tab key automatically positions the user at the next input statement.
- \* Pressing Open-Apple-Tab automatically positions the user at the previous input statement. The prior response to the previous input will be displayed as that input's default.
- \* The last input on the display will normally ask if the user has completed all responses to her or his satisfaction.
