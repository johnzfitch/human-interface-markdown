Use a page indicator when each view in your application is a peer of every other view. Do not use a page indicator if your application displays information in a hierarchy of views, because a page indicator does not help users retrace their steps through a specific path.  
**Vertically center a page indicator between the bottom edge of an open view and the bottom edge of the screen**, where it is always visible without getting in users' way. Be sure to avoid trying to display too many dots for the current screen orientation.  
**On iPad, investigate ways to display your content on a single screen**. On the large iPad screen multiple parallel screens don't work as well, so the need for the page indicator control is decreased.
