Applications that support text entry and editing should provide a Font menu and Font panel. The Font panel is described in Chapter 5. It contains controls that let users set and preview fonts. The Font menu has a command to bring up the panel, and commands to make common adjustments to a font.  
Each command alters one aspect of the font, such as its size or style, while leaving other aspects intact. The Font menu and Font panel target currently selected text. The Preferences panel should be used to alter the default font.
