<span id="page-104-4"></span>As described in ["Naming Files and Showing Filename Extensions" \(page 249\),](#page-248-1) your application should pass in a filename extension as part of every filename. Users can control its visibility using the "Hide extension" checkbox in the expanded Save dialog; for more information, see ["The Expanded Save Dialog" \(page 107\)](#page-106-1). Existing documents do not get extensions added to or removed from their filenames unless the user chooses Save As and changes the setting in the Save dialog.
