When you design an Extras Drawer icon, you should also come up with the name to be displayed beneath it. If the name is too long to fit on one line, the Extras Drawer automatically wraps the name onto a second line. You can control where the line breaks by including a blank space or a hyphen at a judicious spot in the name. Despite this accommodation of two-line icon names, you should avoid them. A two-line icon name crowds the icon below it and diminishes the vertical separation between icon rows.  
Whether one line or two, broad icon names may collide in the Extras Drawer. To keep an icon name from running into its neighbors, make it no more than 9 to 11 characters long per line. (The length depends on which letters are in the name, since letters are different widths.)  
Don't worry about your careful work devising an icon name being undone by a user changing the name. Users cannot change the names of Extras Drawer icons.
