Keyboard shortcuts are used throughout Mac OS X to provide quick ways for users to initiate certain actions. Many are provided by the operating system to meet both general usability needs and accessibility needs. The operating system therefore reserves certain keys and keyboard combinations for its use. These combinations, listed in Table 2-3 and Table 2-4, affect all applications and should not be used for any other function. Other keyboard shortcuts are used by the universal access features in Mac OS X and should be avoided unless you are absolutely sure that your users will not be using these features. These are noted in *Making Carbon Applications Accessible to Users With Disabilities*. A complete list of the keyboard shortcuts commonly used in Mac OS X is provided in ["Keyboard Shortcuts Quick Reference"](#page-226-1) (page 227).  
<span id="page-27-1"></span>You may also define keyboard shortcuts in your application for frequently used commands. Some guidelines on how to decide which shortcuts are appropriate are in ["Creating Your Own](#page-28-2) [Keyboard Shortcuts"](#page-28-2) (page 29). Other sections of this document suggest keyboard shortcuts, where appropriate, to help you maintain a consistent and familiar user experience across applications.
