The Newton interface also includes a **slider,** with which users can set a magnitude, position, probability, or other value in a range. Users set a value by dragging a diamond-shaped knob. The knob indicates the current value relative to the maximum and minimum values. A slider should have labels that identify the range and direction of the slider. [Figure 3-20](#page-114-0) shows an example of a slider.
