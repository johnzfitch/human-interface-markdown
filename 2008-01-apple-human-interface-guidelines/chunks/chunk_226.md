A **transparent panel** gives users a way to make quick adjustments to their content or task without being distracted from their work. Although the behavior of a transparent panel is similar to the behavior of a standard panel, its appearance is designed to complement applications that focus on highly visual content or that provide an immersive experience, such as a full-screen slide show. For example, Figure 14-41 shows a transparent panel iChat provides.

#### When to Use Transparent Panels  
It's important to understand that transparent panels are not intended to replace all panels in every application. In fact, in applications that don't focus on highly visual content or provide an immersive environment, a transparent panel can be more distracting to users than a standard panel, because there is no logical reason for its presence.  
In general, therefore, you should use transparent panels only when at least one of the following statements is true:  
- Your application is media-centric, that is, focused on movies, photos, or slides.
- Users use your application in a dark environment or in an immersion mode.
- A standard panel would distract users from the main window.
- Users make only quick adjustments in the panel and dismiss it quickly.  
For example, in Aperture (a photo post-production and management tool), a transparent panel is appropriate because it does not block the content the way a standard panel would. In addition, the transparent adjustment panel in Aperture contains easy-to-use controls that don'trequire anykeyboard input from the user. Figure 14-42 shows how this transparent panel allows users to focus on the images.

If your application focuses on highly visual content only at specific times or only in some modes, a combination of standard and transparent panels is reasonable, as long as each panel is suited to its task and environment. Also, if you provide a transparent panel under these circumstances, don't transform the panel into a standard (nontransparent) panel when your application switches modes. In other words, a transparent panel is always a transparent panel; it never converts to a standard panel.  
For example, Keynote allows users to create presentations that contain text, images, video, and sound. In addition to providing the Mac OS X Colors and Fonts windows, Keynote provides an inspector window and a media browser, which are standard panels. The inspector window allows users to set slide transitions, edit tables and graphs, and make complex adjustments to text and formatting, and the media browser allows them to navigate collections of media files and make selections. Neither of these panels focuses solely on adjustments to visual content, so there is no reason for them to be transparent.  
But Keynote also provides an image-adjustment panel, which helps users make simple adjustments to slide images. The image-adjustment panel is transparent, because users use itwhile theyare focusing on the image, watching the effect of the adjustments they make. Figure 14-43 shows the transparent image-adjustment panel in Keynote.

#### Designing a Transparent Panel  
If a transparent panel is appropriate for your application, it's important to design it appropriately to ensure that it looks good and meets users' needs. In particular, a transparent panel should contain only simple adjustment controls that do not require much, if any, typing. Sliders and stepper-style controls work well, because they're easy for users to use without focusing on them. As much as possible, you should avoid controls that require users to type or to select items, because they force users to shift their attention from the content to the panel. This defeats one of the main advantages of transparent panels, which is to allow users to focus on their content.  
Because controls and text need to be visible on the dark translucent background of a transparent panel, you should design controls that are white with gray accents and use white or gray text. As users focus on the content behind the panel, the white text and controls appear to be floating above it.  
Often, small amounts of color can enhance the information you provide in a transparent panel. For example, the morsels of color in the Aperture Adjustments panel (shown in [Figure](#page-234-0) 14-42 (page 235)) communicate ranges in white balance and exposure, in addition to color-specific settings, in a clear and unobtrusive way.  
If you want to use color in your transparent panel, be sure to use it sparingly, because an overuse of color lessens its impact and can be distracting. At the same time, however, the small amounts of color you use should be high contrast to look good on the dark translucent background.  
In general, transparent panels should be small, so the text and controls you design should be small, too. As you lay out a transparent panel, be sure to follow the standard Aqua layout guidelines.
