A **scope bar** allows users to specify locations or rules in a search or to filter objects by specific criteria. In general, scope bars are not visible all the time, but appearwhen the userinitiates a search or similar operation. Figure 14-19 shows the scope bar Safari displays when the user performs a find (because the Safari find operation does not allow the addition of scoping criteria, you can think of it as using an implied scope of "all").
