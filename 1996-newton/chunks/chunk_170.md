The system lets users know when it is temporarily busy and may be unable to respond to their input by displaying a small graphic, called the **busy cursor,**  at the top of the screen. Your application or transport does not need to do anything to benefit from this feedback; the system displays the busy cursor automatically as needed. Figure 8-1 shows a busy cursor.

The automatic busy cursor is not meant to provide complete feedback during a lengthy operation. If your application or transport begins an operation that may take more than a few seconds to complete, it should display a status slip (see the next section and ["Status Slips" on page 2-20\)](#page-63-0).
