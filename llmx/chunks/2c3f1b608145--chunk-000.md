<!-- Chunk 0 | Source: 1986-07 Human Interface Guidelines (Second Beta Draft).pdf | Est. Tokens: 247 -->
date: 22 July 1986  
writer: John Huber Apple Technical Publications, Mailstop 22-K  
Here is your copy of the second beta draft of *Human Interface Guidelines*, which will be laserset and distributed through APDA (Apple Programmers and Developers Association).  
This is *really* your last chance to make substantial changes or suggestions. *I know*, I told you that before—but the book has been enlarged and reorganized since then. After the final draft is circulated, only the most essential changes will be considered. If you don't have time to review the entire document, at least look at the parts dealing with your own area of interest or expertise.
