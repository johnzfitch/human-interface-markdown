<span id="page-43-6"></span>The Aqua interface is designed to provide an understandable, familiar, and predictable environment. To give users a visual sense of stability, the interface defines many standard graphical elements, such as the menu bar, window controls, and so on. These standard elements provide users with a familiar environment in which they know how things behave and what to do with them.  
To give users a conceptual sense of stability, the interface provides a clear, finite set of objects and a set of actions to perform on those objects. For example, when a menu command doesn't apply to a selected object or to the object in its current state, the command is dimmed rather than omitted.  
To help convey the perception of stability, preserve user-modifiable settings such as window dimensions and locations. When a user sets up his or her onscreen environment to have a certain layout, the settings should stay that way until the user changes them.  
Providing status and feedback also contributes to perceived stability by letting users know that the application is performing the specified task.
