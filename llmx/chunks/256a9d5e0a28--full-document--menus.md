#### Menus

Menus are central to the "noun-verb" principle of the Apple Desktop Interface: the user first selects an object (noun), either on the desktop or in a window, then chooses, from a menu, the operation (verb) to be applied to this object.

Because menus display the full range of potential activities available, users don't have to remember and type command names. Instead, they simply choose from the alternatives presented. The user's task is recognition, not recall.

Because they list all available activities, menus let users quickly get an overview (or, for new users, a preview) of what is possible at any given moment.

Finally, pull-down menus make it possible to keep unnecessary detail out of sight, and out of the way of the main task, while still making those details quickly and easily available. The user "pulls down" a menu only when it's needed—the rest of the time, the menu is "rolled up" into the menu bar at the top of the screen.

The overall concept of pull-down menus comprises three fundamental screen elements: the menu bar, where the name of each available menu appears; pull-down menus, which appear only when the user wants them to; and the menu items themselves.
