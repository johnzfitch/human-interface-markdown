Consistency in the interface allows people to transfer their knowledge and skills from one application to any other. Use the standard elements of the Aqua interface to ensure consistency within your application and to benefit from consistency across applications. Ask yourself the following questions when thinking about consistency in your product.  
Is your product consistent  
- within itself?
- with earlier versions of your product?
- with Mac OS standards? For example, does your application use the reserved and recommended keyboard equivalents? (See ["Reserved and Recommended](#page-175-0)  [Keyboard Equivalents" \(page 176\)](#page-175-0).)
- in its use of metaphors?
- with people's expectations?  
Matching everyone's expectations is the most difficult kind of consistency to achieve, since your product is likely used by an audience with a wide range of expertise. You can address this problem by carefully weighing the consistency issues in the context of your target audience and their needs.
