Whenever possible, name a button with a verb that describes the action that it performs. Button names should be limited to one word whenever possible. You should never use more than three words for a button name. Use the caps/lowercase style of capitalization for button names. In general, this means that you capitalize every word except articles *(a, an, the)*, coordinating conjunctions (for example, *and, or*), and prepositions of three or fewer letters. You also capitalize the first and last words of the name; since button names should seldom be more than two words, almost all words in button names should be capitalized. The specific rules for this type of capitalization appear in detail in the *Apple Publications Style Guide.*  
Button names usually appear in 12-point Chicago. If a button is not available, it appears dimmed. On a black-and-white monitor, a dimmed button and its name are dithered to 50 percent gray. On color systems, dimmed items appear in true gray. Chicago is designed specifically to display well on the screen in all states, including dithered and gray. Other fonts, such as Geneva, which is sometimes used for button names, are rendered illegible when they are dithered.  
Buttons usually cause instant actions, described by the name of the button. Occasionally they require more information before acting. If a button displays another dialog box, use the ellipsis character in the button name to indicate this to the user. (Do not include the ellipsis character if the dialog box appears only to ask users to confirm their actions.) The most appropriate situation for a second dialog box to appear would be when a modeless dialog box needed additional information on a limited basis to complete an action. See the section "Stacking Modal Dialog Boxes," which begins on page 192 in Chapter 6, "Dialog Boxes," for a discussion of the dangers of dialog boxes that generate more dialog boxes.  
A user typically reads the text in a dialog box until it becomes familiar and then relies on visual cues, such as button names or positions, to respond. Names such as Save, Quit, and Erase Disk allow users to identify and click the correct button quickly. These words are often more clear and precise than names such as OK, Yes, and No. If the action can't be condensed into a word or two, OK and Cancel or Yes and No may serve the purpose. If you use these generic words, be sure to phrase the wording in the dialog box so that the action the button initiates is clear. Figure 7-3 shows a dialog box with appropriate OK and Cancel buttons.

Use Cancel for the button that closes the alert box or dialog box and returns the application to the state it was in before the alert box or dialog box appeared. Cancel means "dismiss the operation I started, with no side effects." It does not mean "I've read this dialog box" or "stop what's going on regardless."  
Ideally, you should never put your users in a situation in which they can't return to the state that existed before an operation began (and before the dialog box appeared). But if it can't be avoided, use OK or Stop, depending on the situation, instead of Cancel. Sometimes it is more appropriate to use the word Done instead of OK for the name of a button that closes the alert box or dialog box and that accepts any changes made while the dialog box is displayed. Figure 7-4 shows a dialog box that illustrates this guideline. In this dialog box, the user creates, renames, or deletes fields and then dismisses the dialog box, so the Done button means "I have finished editing fields and want to close the dialog box."

This dialog box uses Done because clicking the Done button maintains any changes that were made subsequent to the display of the dialog box. If the button were named OK, the user might confuse it with the Add Field button, which accepts changes but doesn't close the dialog box and therefore allows the user to make other changes. The Done button is most often used in dialog boxes in which the user can define more than one of an item, for example, field names, without closing the dialog box. In these situations it is often unreasonably difficult to return the user to the state that existed before the operation began, so there is no Cancel button.  
Use Stop for a button that halts an operation midstream while accepting the possible side effects. Stop may leave the results of a partially complete task intact, whereas Cancel always returns the computer to its previous state. It's appropriate to change the button name in the middle of the operation from Cancel to Stop if you can determine when it's no longer possible to cancel. The dialog box shown in Figure 7-5 uses a Stop button because clicking the button maintains the text that is already inserted while preventing completion of the insert operation.

In an alert box that requires confirmation, use a word that describes the result of accepting the message in the dialog box. For example, if a dialog box says "Revert to the last saved version of this document?" name the button Revert rather than OK. Figure 7-6 shows a dialog box with appropriately named buttons.

A modal dialog box usually cuts the user off from the task. That is, the user can't see the area of the document that changes when choices are made in the dialog box until dismissing the dialog box. Once the area becomes visible because the user dismisses the dialog box, the user sees whether the changes are the desired ones. If the changes aren't appropriate, then the user has to repeat the entire operation. To provide better feedback to the user, you need to provide a way for the user to see what the changes will be. Therefore, any selection made in a modal dialog box should immediately update the document contents, or you should provide a sample area in the dialog box that reflects the changes that the user's choices will make. In the case of immediate document updating, the OK button means "accept this change" and the Cancel button means "undo all changes done by this dialog box."  
Some applications use an Apply button to approximate the behavior of immediately updating the document or using a sample area. This method confuses the meaning of OK and Cancel and is not recommended. If you must implement modal dialog boxes with an Apply button, you need to include a Cancel button. When there is an Apply button, the Cancel button undoes the results of the Apply operation and dismisses the dialog box. The OK button dismisses the dialog box and applies the settings made in the dialog box, even if the Apply button wasn't clicked. The user must always be able to undo any actions caused by the dialog box.
