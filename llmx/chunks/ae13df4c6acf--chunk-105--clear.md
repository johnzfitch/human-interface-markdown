#### Clear  
The Clear command removes data that the user selects just prior to choosing the command. Unlike Cut and Copy, the Clear command does not put the selection in the Clipboard. The Clipboard is unchanged and your application displays the new selection in the same way as it would after a cut operation.  
Pressing the Delete (Backspace) key or the Clear key has the same effect as choosing the Clear command from the File menu. (Note that the Backspace key and the Clear key do not appear on all keyboards.)
