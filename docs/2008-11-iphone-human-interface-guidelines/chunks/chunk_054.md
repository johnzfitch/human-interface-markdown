A **date and time picker** gives users an easy way to select a specific date or time. A date and time picker can have up to four independent spinning wheels, each of which displays values in a single category, such as month or hour. Users flick or drag to spin each wheel until it displays the desired value beneath the clear selection bar that stretches across the middle of the picker. The final value comprises the values displayed in each wheel. Figure 9-2 shows an example of a date and time picker.

Use a date and time picker to allow users to avoid typing values that consist of multiple parts, such as the day, month, and year of a date. A date and time picker works well because the values in each part have a relatively small range and users already know what the values are.  
Depending on the mode you specify, a date and time picker displays a different number of wheels, each with a set of different values. The date and time picker defines the following modes:  
- **Time**. The time mode displays wheels for the hour and minute values, with the optional addition of a wheel for the AM/PM designation.
- **Date**. The date mode displays wheels for the month, day, and year values.
- **Date and time**. The date and time mode displays wheels for the calendar date, hour, and minute values, with the optional addition of a wheel for the AM/PM designation. This is the default mode.
- **Countdown timer**. The countdown timer mode displays wheelsfor the hour and minute. You can specify the total duration of a countdown, up to a maximum of 23 hours and 59 minutes.  
By default, a minutes wheel displays 60 values (0 to 59). However, if you need to display a coarser granularity of choices, you can set a minutes wheel to display intervals of minutes, as long as the interval divides evenly into 60. For example, you might want to display the quarter-hour intervals 0, 15, 30, and 45.  
Regardless of its configuration, the overall size of a date and time picker is fixed, and is the same size as the keyboard. You might choose to make a date and time picker a focal element in your view, or cause it to appear only when needed. For example, the timer mode of the built-in Clock application displays an always-visible date and time picker because the selection of a time is central to the function of the Timer. On the other hand, the Set Date & Time preference (available in Settings > General > Date & Time, when you turn off Set Automatically) displays transient date and time pickers, depending on whether users want to set the date or the time.
