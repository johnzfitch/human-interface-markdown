Visually confusing or unattractive displays detract from the effectiveness of human-computer interactions.  
Different "things" look different on the screen.  
Users should be able to control the superficial appearance of their computer workplaces—to display their own style and individuality.  
Messes are acceptable only if the user makes them—applications aren't allowed this freedom.  
In traditional applications, the visual appearance of the screen has been a low priority and consequently somewhat arbitrary. In contrast, the Apple Desktop Interface depends on the visual appearance of the screen. People deserve and appreciate attractive surroundings. Consistent visual communication is very powerful in delivering complex messages and opportunities simply, subtly, and directly.  
Users should have some control over the look of their workspaces. This allows individual expression and relieves the computer designer of having to devise one "look" that appeals to everyone.  
The next section summarizes some basic principles of visual design.
