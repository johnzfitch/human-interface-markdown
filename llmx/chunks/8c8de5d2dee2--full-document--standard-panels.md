## **Standard Panels**

Some panels show up in many different applications. For example, every application must have an Info panel, which gives certain kinds of general information about the application. Text processing applications also have a Font panel, which lets the user set the font of the text selection. .

This section describes all the standard panels. Some of them you have to create from scratch, using the guidelines in this section. Others are provided by the Application Kit. If a standard panel exists for functionality in your application, you should use it rather than designing your own.

You can customize Application Kit panels, if necessary, by adding controls and information to what the Application Kit provides. For example, the Open panel on the left, below, has a check box added to it. Compare it to the normal Open panel on the right.
