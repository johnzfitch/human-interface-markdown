iCloud lets people access the content they care about regardless of which device they're currently using. When you integrate iCloud into your app, users can use different instances of your app on different devices to view and edit their personal content without performing explicit synchronization.

To provide this user experience, it's likely that you'll need to reexamine the ways in which you store, access, and present information—especially user-created content—in your app. To learn how to enable iCloud in your app, see *iCloud Design Guide* .  
A fundamental aspect of the iCloud user experience is transparency: Ideally, users don't need to know where their content is located and they should seldom have to think about which version of the content they're currently viewing. The following guidelines can help you give users the iCloud experience they're expecting.  
**If appropriate, make it easy for users to enable iCloud for your app.** On their iOS devices, users log into their iCloud account in iCloud Settings, and for the most part, they expect their appsto work with iCloud automatically. But if you think users might want to choose whether to use iCloud with your app, you can provide a simple option that they can set when they open your app for the first time. In most cases, this option should provide a choice between using iCloud with all the content that users access in your app or not at all.  
**Respect the user's iCloud space.** It's important to remember that iCloud is a finite resource for which users pay. You should use iCloud for storing information that users create and understand, and avoid using it to store app resources or content that you can regenerate. Also, note that when the user's iCloud account is active, iCloud automatically backs up the contents of your app's Documents folder. To avoid using up too much of the user's space, it's best to be picky about the content you place in the Documents folder.  
**Avoid asking users to choose which documents to store in iCloud.** Typically, users expect all the content they care about to be available via iCloud. Most users don't need to manage the storage of individual documents, so you shouldn't assume that your app needs to support this experience. To provide a good user experience, you might want to rearchitect the way your app handles and exposes content so that you can perform more file-management tasks for the user.  
**Determine which types of information to store in iCloud.** In addition to storing user-created documents and other content, you can also store small amounts of data such as the user's current state in your app or their preferences. To store this type of information you use iCloud key-value storage. For example, if people use your app to read a magazine, you might use iCloud key-value storage to store the last page they viewed so that when they reopen the issue on a different device, they can continue reading from where they left off.  
If you use iCloud key-value storage to store preferences, be sure that the preferences are ones that users are likely to want to have applied to all their devices. For example, some preferences are more useful in a work environment than they are in a home environment. In some cases, it can make sense to store preferences on your app's server, instead of in the user's iCloud account, so that the preferences are available regardless of whether iCloud is enabled.  
**Make sure that your app behaves reasonably when iCloud is unavailable.** For example, if users log out of their iCloud account, turn off iCloud usage for your app, or enter Airplane mode, iCloud becomes unavailable. In these cases, users performed an action that turned off access to iCloud, so your app does not need to tell them about it. However, it can be appropriate to show users that the changes they make will not be visible on their other devices until they restore access to iCloud.  
**Avoid giving users the option to create a "local" document.**Regardless of whether you support iCloud in your app, you should not encourage users to think in terms of a device-specific file system. Instead, you want users to focus on the pervasive availability of their content through iCloud.  
**When appropriate, update content automatically.** It's best when users don't have to take any action to ensure that they're accessing the most up-to-date content in your app. However, you need to balance this experience with respect for the user's device space and bandwidth constraints. If your users work with very large documents, it can be appropriate to give them control over whether to download an update from iCloud. If you need to do this, design a way to indicate that a more recent version of the document is available in iCloud. When the user chooses to update the document, be sure to provide subtle feedback if the download takes more than a few seconds.  
**Warn users about the consequences of deleting a document.** When a user deletes a document in an iCloud-enabled app, the document is removed from the user's iCloud account and all other devices. It's appropriate to display an alert that describesthisresult and to get confirmation before you perform the deletion.  
**Tell users about conflicts as soon as possible, but only when necessary.** Using the iCloud programming interfaces, you should be able to resolve most conflicts between different versions of a document without involving the user. In cases where this is not possible, make sure that you detect conflicts as soon as possible so that you can help users avoid wasting time on the wrong version of their content. You need to design an unobtrusive way to show users that a conflict exists; then, make it easy for users to differentiate between versions and make a decision.  
**Be sure to include the user's iCloud content in searches.** Users with iCloud accounts tend to think of their content as being universally available, and they expect search results to reflect this perspective. If your app allows people to search their content, make sure you use the appropriate APIs to extend search to their iCloud accounts.
