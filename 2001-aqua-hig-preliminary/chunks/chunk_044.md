■ **Behavior:** A contextual menu behaves like a standard sticky menu, except that moving the pointer off a contextual menu and onto a standard pull-down menu doesn't activate the second menu; the user must click once to close the contextual menu and again to open the second menu.  
Contextual menus that are too long to display fully show the scrolling triangle and scroll like standard menus.  
Don't set a default item. If the user opens the menu and closes it without selecting anything, no action should occur.  
■ **Contents:** You define the items in your application's contextual menus. Include a small subset of the most commonly used commands in the appropriate context. If you don't define any items, the menu displays a Help item and loads appropriate plug-ins.  
Never provide a contextual menu command that is not also accessible through the menu bar. Use submenus with caution and keep them to one level.  
If the user presses the Control key while clicking your application icon in the Dock, a contextual menu should open with useful commands, such as Hide, Remove From Dock, Show Original, and Quit.
