People generally expect to use their iOS devices in any orientation, so it's best when your app responds appropriately.  
**Maintain focus on the primary content in all orientations.** This is your highest priority. People use your app to view and interact with the content they care about. Changing the focus when the device rotates can disorient people and make them feel they've lost control over the app.  
**In general, run in all orientations.** People expect to use your app in different orientations, and it's best when you can fulfill that expectation. iPad users, in particular, expect to use your app in whichever orientation they're currently holding their device. But some apps need to run in portrait only or in landscape only. If it's essential that your app run in only one orientation, you should:  
● **Launch your app in the supported orientation,regardless ofthe current device orientation.** For example, if a game or media-viewing app runs in landscape only, it's appropriate to launch the app in landscape, even if the device is currently in portrait. This way, if people start the app while the device is in portrait, they know to rotate the device to landscape to view the content.

- **Avoid displaying aUI elementthattells people to rotate the device.** Running in the supported orientation clearly tells people to rotate the device, if required, without adding unnecessary clutter to the UI.
- **Support both variants of an orientation.** For example, if an app runs only in landscape, people should be able to use it whether they're holding the device with the Home button on the right or on the left. And if people rotate the device 180 degrees while using the app, it's best if the app responds by rotating its content 180 degrees.  
#### **If your app interprets changes in device orientation as user input, handle rotation in app-specific ways.**  
For example, a game that lets people move game pieces by rotating the device can't respond to device rotation by rotating the screen. In a case like this, you should launch in both variants of the required orientation and allow people to switch between the variants until they start the main task of the app. As soon as people begin the main task, begin responding to device movement in app-specific ways.  
**On iPhone, anticipate users' needs when you respond to a change in device orientation.** Users often rotate their devices to landscape orientation because they want to "see more." If you respond by merely scaling up the content, you fail to meet users' expectations. Instead, respond by rewrapping lines of text and—if necessary—adjusting the layout of the UI so that more content fits on the screen.  
**On iPad, strive to satisfy users' expectations by supporting all orientations.** The iPad screen mitigates people's desire to rotate the device to landscape to "see more." And because people don't pay much attention to the minimal frame of the device or the location of the Home button, they don't tend to view the device as having a default orientation.  
Follow these guidelines as you design how your iPad app should provide a great experience in all orientations:  
- **Consider changing how you display auxiliary information or functionality.** While keeping the most important content alwaysin focus, you can respond to rotation by changing the way you provide secondary content.
- For example, an iPad game that displays a rectangular game board in landscape orientation needs to redraw the board to fit well in portrait orientation. Instead of vertically stretching the game board in portrait orientation—or leaving empty space above or below it—the game could display supplemental information or objects in the additional space.
- **Avoid gratuitous changes in layout.** A comparable experience in all orientations allows people to maintain their usage patterns when they rotate the device. For example, if your iPad app displays images in a grid while in landscape, it's not necessary to display the same information in a list while in portrait (although you might adjust the dimensions of the grid).
- **As much as possible, avoid reformatting information and rewrapping text on rotation.** Strive to maintain a similar format in all orientations. If people are reading text in an app, it's especially important to help them keep their place when they rotate the device.
- If some reformatting is unavoidable, use animation to help people track the changes. For example, if you add or remove a column of text in different orientations, you can hide the movement of columns and simply fade in the new arrangement. To help you design appropriate rotation behavior, think about how you'd expect your content to behave if you were physically interacting with it in the real world.
- <span id="page-62-0"></span>● **Provide a unique launch image for each orientation.** When each orientation has a unique launch image, people experience a smooth app start regardless of the current device orientation. The iPad Home screen supports all orientations, so people are likely to start your app in the same orientation in which they used the previous app.
