Mac OS 8 introduces new appearances for the standard modal, modeless, and movable modal dialog boxes, and alert boxes. It also introduces a new movable alert box. [Figure 8](#page-11-0) shows a modeless dialog box, a movable modal dialog box, and a modal dialog box.  
Note that the modeless dialog box has a draggable border so that users can drag from any side of the dialog box to move it. Mac OS 8 supports keyboard navigation to all controls within dialog boxes. You specify the tab ordering when you create the dialog box. The Mac OS 8 Toolbox now provides the default button appearance and behavior when you specify which button is the default.

The movable alert box appearance combines the traditional alert box design with a title bar that allows users to drag the alert box around. This ability gives users the chance to see what may be obscured beneath the alert box if it appears on top of the content it addresses. In general, you should always use the movable alert box where you previously used the alert box. The user still must dismiss the alert box by clicking a button. However, you should make the movable alert box modal only to your application so that the user can switch to another application while the alert box is displayed. Figure 9 shows the new movable alert box design.

Note that the alert box now has a colored frame and colored background on the alert icon. Remember to follow the guidelines in *Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines* regarding language in dialog boxes and dialog box messages.
