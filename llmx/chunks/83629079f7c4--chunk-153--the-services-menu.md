#### The Services Menu  
![](images/_page_142_Picture_3.jpeg)  
This required menu contains commands that invoke services provided by the system or by other applications. All the commands in the menu are placed there by the Application Kit from information furnished by service providers (so there's no need to specify where commands should be added).
