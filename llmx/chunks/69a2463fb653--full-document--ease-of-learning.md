# Ease of Learning

Tools are easy to learn when they start with what the user already knows. Concrete metaphors, when made plain, let users apply their non-computing experience to a new environment. Most people today are used to desks, calculators, file folders, and paper. They write messages on paper, move papers around on desktops, store collections of related papers in file folders, and toss unwanted papers into trash baskets. They keep drawing tools and calculator close at hand. The Apple desktop interface is based on these familiar things. The way users directly manipulate data in the computer resembles the way they manipulate physical things on a physical desktop.

The goal is to let the user accomplish what needs to be done spontaneously and intuitively, rather than making him or her think: "Let's see; to do C, first I have to do A and B and then..." With pull-down menus, for example, the user can choose a desired operation directly and quickly, with a greatly reduced error rate.

As a general rule, the more often a thing is done, the easier it should be to do. Only things that are rarely done (or are hazardous to the user's data or sanity) should even approach being difficult to do.

When computers are easy to learn and use, people make fewer mistakes and enjoy what they're doing!
