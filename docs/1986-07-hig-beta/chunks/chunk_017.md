People learn best when they get consistent feedback that lets them observe patterns. The interface's consistent environment promotes learning. It also encourages exploration without penalty. For example, the user can try something out before really understanding it, without fear of grave consequences. In the best cases, the interface even encourages "mistakes," showing users how *not* to do things so that they can generate an effective model for interactions. It does this by providing extensive messages that warn users when they are entering into dangerous waters (for example, "Do you really want to erase your entire disk?").  
The user's skill with the interface will increase with experience; it is not expected that everything should be understood at first glance. The appropriate focus is on ease of learning and on safety—not on simplicity or superficiality.
