For some situations, it's clear what control is appropriate:  
- Scrollers are used only when material is displayed in an area that might be too small.
- Sliders are used when there's a need to graphically set a value that's in a bounded range (of colors, numbers, or sound levels, for example).
- Text fields are used whenever it's impossible or impractical to provide a list of all possible values.
- Color wells are used only with the Colors panel, and only where complex color characteristics are needed.
- Browsers are used only for data that's organized in a hierarchy.  
Buttons and selection lists are flexible, though. They can be used in many ways. The following sections describe how to decide which type of button to use, and when to use a selection list.
