A **rounded rectangle button** is a versatile button you can use in a view to perform an action. You can see examples of this type of button at the bottom of an individual's Contacts view: The Text Message and Add to Favorites buttons are rounded rectangle buttons, as shown in Figure 9-9.

When you supply a title for a rounded rectangle button, be sure to:  
- Use title-style capitalization (that is, capitalize every word except articles, coordinating conjunctions, and prepositions of four or fewer letters)
- <span id="page-115-1"></span>■ Avoid creating a title that is too long. Overly long text gets truncated, which can make it difficult for users to understand it.
