In general, each command in the **File menu** should apply to a single file (most commonly, a user-created document).  
Note that the Preferences and Quit commands, which apply to a whole application, are in the application menu. If your application provides document-specific preferences, make them available in theFile menu, preferablyright above printingcommands. If an application is not document-based, you can rename the File menu to something more appropriate or eliminate it.  
Several items in the File menu—Save As, Print, and Page Setup, for example—should open sheets. For more information, see ["Document-Modal](#page-199-1) Dialogs (Sheets) " (page 200).

<span id="page-155-4"></span>Standard File menu commands include these:  
<span id="page-155-3"></span>**New (Command-N).** Opens a new document named "untitled" (or "untitled 2," and so on, as appropriate). If your application requires documents to be named upon creation, you can display a Save dialog (see "Dialogs for Saving, Closing, and [Quitting"](#page-210-0) (page 211)). For more information about naming new document windows, see "Opening [Windows"](#page-181-1) (page 182).  
<span id="page-155-5"></span>**Open… (Command-O).** Displays a dialog for choosing an existing document to open. Note that in the Finder, the Open command is not followed by an ellipsis character because the user performs navigation and document selection before selecting the Open command. For more information, see "The Open [Dialog](#page-208-0) " (page 209).  
**Open Recent.** The Open command can be followed by Open Recent so that people can open recently opened documents without using the Open dialog. The Open Recent submenu displays documents in the order in which they were opened, with the most recent item at the top. This optional command is most useful in office-productivity or other document-based applications. Note that the ability to open recent documents and applications is provided by the Apple menu in the Recent Items menu item.  
<span id="page-155-1"></span>If you choose to include the Open Recent command, be sure to display document names only; don't display file paths. Users have their own ways of keeping track of which documents are which and file paths are inappropriate to display unless specifically requested by the user.  
**Carbon:** You should add documents to this submenu when they are opened or saved. **Cocoa:** The Open Recent submenu is populated automatically.  
<span id="page-155-2"></span>**Close (Command-W).** Closes the active window. When the user chooses this command and the active document has been changed since last saved, display the Save Changes alert (see ["Dialogs](#page-210-0) for Saving, Closing, and [Quitting"](#page-210-0) (page 211)). When the user presses the Option key, Close changes to Close All. The keyboard shortcuts Command-W and Command-Option-W should implement the Close and Close All commands,respectively. The Close command and Command-W should not close utility windows.  
**Close File (Command-Shift-W).** In a file-based application that supports multiple views of the same file, you can include a Close File command below Close Window to close a file and all its associated windows. If possible, include the filename in the menu (for example, Close File "Jerry's Kids").  
<span id="page-156-3"></span>**Save (Command-S).** Saves the active document, leaves the document open, and provides feedback indicating that the document is being (or has been) saved. If the document has not previously been saved, dim the Save command and make sure the Save As command is active instead. If an open document has been previously saved and the user has made no changes to it, the Save command is dimmed.  
<span id="page-156-5"></span>**Save As… (Command-Shift-S).** Displays the Save dialog (described in "Save [Dialogs"](#page-210-2) (page 211)), which allows the user to save a copy of the active document with a new user-defined name, a new location, or both. The newly saved document remains open and active. If the document has not previously been saved, the Save command is dimmed and the Save As command is active.  
Avoid providing multiple Save As *File Format* menu commands that each save the document in a different file format. Instead, use the Format pop-up menu in the Save dialog to present the user with a selection of file formats. For example, the Format pop-up menu in Safari's Save dialog allows the user to save the current content of the window as a web archive or a page source.  
<span id="page-156-11"></span><span id="page-156-7"></span>**Note:** Avoid using Save a Copy or Save To commands. Users might not understand the distinction between them and Save As.  
<span id="page-156-6"></span>**Save All.** Saves changes to all open documents.  
<span id="page-156-8"></span><span id="page-156-2"></span>**Revert to Saved.** Discards all changes made to the active document since the last time it was saved or opened. When the user chooses Revert to Saved, display an alert that warns the user about the potential data loss the operation will cause.  
<span id="page-156-4"></span>**Print… (Command-P).** Opens the standard Print dialog, which allows users to print to a printer, to send a fax, or to save as a PDF file. For more information, see ["Printing](#page-217-0) Dialogs " (page 218).  
<span id="page-156-0"></span>**Page Setup… (Command-Shift-P).** Opens a dialogfor specifying printing parameters such as paper size and printing orientation. These parameters are saved with the document.
