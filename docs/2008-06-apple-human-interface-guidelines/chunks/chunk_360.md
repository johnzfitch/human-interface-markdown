Use a pop-up menu to present up to 12 mutually exclusive choices that the user doesn't need to see all the time. Sometimes a pop-up menu can be a good alternative to other types of selection controls. For example, if you have a dialog that contains a set of six or more radio buttons, you might consider replacing them with a pop-up menu to save space.  
Avoid adding a submenu to any item in a pop-up menu. Doing so hides choices too deeply and is physically difficult for users to use.  
#### Avoid using pop-up menus:  
- For more than 12 items; instead, use a scrolling list unless space is restricted.
- When the number of items in the list can change.
- When more than one simultaneous selection is appropriate, such as in a list of text styles (from which users might choose both bold and italic). In this situation, you should instead use checkboxes or a pull-down menu in which checkmarks appear.
