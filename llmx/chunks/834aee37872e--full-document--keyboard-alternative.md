#### *keyboard alternative*

A way of using the keyboard, rather than the mouse, to choose a menu command, operate a button in a panel, or pick an item from a pop-up or pull-down list. While holding a Command key down, the user types a character associated with the command, button, or item. See also *key equivalent.*
