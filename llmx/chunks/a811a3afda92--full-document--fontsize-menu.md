#### FontSize menu

Font sizes are measured in **points**. A point is a typographical unit of measure equivalent to 1/72 inch. The FontSize menu lists the nine standard available sizes. The font size currently in effect is indicated with a check mark. (See Figure 42.) Not every font is available in all sizes; the sizes that are available for the selected font are shown outlined in the FontSize menu. A font can be **scaled** to the other sizes, but scaled fonts usually suffer in appearance on the screen and when printed by some kinds of printers.

This sentence is in 10-point type. The chapter title on the first page of this chapter is in 18-point type.

If there's insufficient room in the menu bar for the word FontSize, it can be abbreviated to Size. If there's insufficient room for both a Font menu and a Size menu, the sizes can be put at the end of the Style menu.
