# Contrast and Discrimination

Color adds another dimension to the array of possible contrasts, and care must be given to maintain good readability and discernment.

Colors on Grays

Colors look best against a background of neutral gray. Colors within your application will stand out more if the background and surrounding areas (such as the window frame and menus) are black and white or gray.

Colored Text

Reading and legibility studies in the print (paper) world show that colored text is harder to read than black text on a white background. This also appears to be true in the limited studies that have been done in the computer domain, although almost all these studies have looked at colors on a black background, rather than a white background. (Keep this in mind if you hear that "amber is the best color for text.")

Beware of Blue

The most illegible color is light blue, which should be avoided for text, thin lines, and small shapes. Adjacent colors that differ only in the amount of blue should also be avoided. However, for things that you want to go unnoticed, like grid lines, blue is the perfect color (think of graph paper or lined paper).

Small Objects

People cannot easily discriminate between small areas of color—to be able to tell what color something is, you have to have enough of it. Changes in the color of small objects must be obvious, not subtle.
