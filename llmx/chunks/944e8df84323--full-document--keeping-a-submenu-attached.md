## **Keeping a Submenu Attached**

The easiest way to attach a submenu is simply to click its controlling command, but the user can also drag to the controlling command and release the mouse button while the cursor is still above it. The controlling command for an attached submenu stays highlighted to indicate that the submenu is attached.

A supermenu and its attached submenu act like a single window. User actions that move or close the supermenu also move and close the submenu; an attached submenu has no close button of its own. A submenu attached to the main menu is assigned to the same window tier as the main menu.

An attached submenu can also have its own attached submenu. This is illustrated below. The Librarian menu is attached to Services, and Services is attached to the main menu. Moving the main menu serves to move all three.
