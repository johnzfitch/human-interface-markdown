## 14. THE ACTIVE FOLDER

One folder is distinguished by its title tab being drawn in a thicker line, and by having two light gray scroll bars on its right and bottom edges. This is the active folder. It is the only folder whose contents may be directly modified by the user. Passive folders may be modified by the system, or as a consequence of actions performed by the user on the active folder.
