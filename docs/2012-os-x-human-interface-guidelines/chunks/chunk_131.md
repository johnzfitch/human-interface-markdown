When the user clicks the **minimize button** in the title bar, double-clicks the title bar, or presses Command-M, the window minimizes into the Dock. The window's icon remains in the Dock until the user clicks it or, if it is the app's only open window, until the user clicks the app icon in the Dock. (To learn more more about the Dock, see "The [Dock"](#page-65-0) (page 66).) The action of "unminimizing" a window that's minimized in the Dock is called expanding.  
Clicking an app icon in the Dock should always result in a window—a document or another appropriate window—becoming active. If a document-based app is not open when the user clicks the Dock icon, the app should open a new, untitled window.  
When a user clicks an open app'sicon in the Dock, the app becomes active and all open unminimized windows are brought to the front; minimized document windows remain in the Dock. If there are no unminimized windows when the user clicksthe Dock icon, the last minimized window should be expanded and made active. If no documents are open, the app should open a new window. (If your app is not document-based, display the main window.)
