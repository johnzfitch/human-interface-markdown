- Do the standard window size and position take into account the dimensions of the screen and the location of the Dock?
- Is the standard state of a window best suited to working on the document (such as no wider than the page width), and not necessarily as large as the full screen?
- Does your application sensibly open new windows in either the standard or the user state?
- Can each resizable window be made as large as the smaller of either the maximum document size or the maximum size of the displays, including multiple monitor displays?
- Is the default position of a window contained on a single screen?
- Is each additional window opened below and to the right of its predecessor?
- If a user drags a window from one monitor to another monitor, does your application open subsequent windows on the second monitor?
- Do you use the lowercase letters "untitled," without additional punctuation, in a new window title? Do you add a number to the second and subsequent new windows, but not to the first? Do you avoid using blank titles?
- Do document titles display or hide filename extensions appropriately?
- Do document windows with unsaved changes display a dot in the close button?
- Before closing a window, do you check to see if the user has changed its size or position? Do you save window positions, and then reopen windows in the size and position in which the user left them?
- Before reopening a window, do you make sure that the size and position are reasonable for the user's current monitor or monitors, which may not be the same as the monitor on which the document was last open?
- When zooming from the user state to the standard state, do you check if the size of the standard state would fit completely on the screen without moving the upper-left corner? If so, is the upper-left corner anchored? If not, is the window moved to an appropriate default location?
- Do you appropriately display controls and selected items in inactive windows?
