<!-- Chunk 21 | Source: 1980 Lisa UI Standards.pdf | Est. Tokens: 135 -->
The list of menu titles in the menu bar and the contents of those menus will change as a function of the active folder and the selection in that folder. Submenu titles may also be brought up by making a selection in one of these main menus. When submenus are used, they should appear toward the right in the menu bar and should not cause any of the main menus to disappear. Thus in a heirarchical menu, the user can always get to a given menu item by the main menu; sometimes she can take a shortcut if the submenu is already in the menubar.
