Performing actions on a system in an indirect fashion reduces the user's sense of direct manipulation. To give users the feeling that they're in control of their computers, many of an application's features are implemented with controls: graphic objects that, when manipulated with the mouse, cause instant action with visible or audible results. Controls also can change settings to modify future actions.  
There are several types of controls. Buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, and scroll bars are all available from the Macintosh Toolbox. You can also design your own controls, such as the thermometer and gauge shown in Figure 44.
