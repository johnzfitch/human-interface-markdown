Direct manipulation is an example of an implied action that helps usersfeel that they are controlling the objects represented by the computer. According to this principle, an onscreen object should remain visible while a user performs an action on it, and the impact of the action should be immediately visible. For example, users can move a file by dragging its icon from one location to another, or drag selected text directly into another document. Another example of direct manipulation is the use of pinching and zooming gestures to resize an onscreen object.  
Direct manipulation often supports the user's mental model of a task, because it can feel more natural than explicit actions. For example, an app that manages a virtual library might allow users to drag a book icon onto a patron's name to check it out, instead of requiring them to open a window, select a book title, select a patron name, and choose a Check Out menu command.
