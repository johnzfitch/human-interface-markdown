Effective applications are both consistent within themselves and consistent with one another.  
Having learned, in one application, a general set of skills, the user can transfer those skills to other applications. By using the standard elements of the Apple Desktop Interface, you ensure consistency within your application and you benefit from consistency across applications.  
Within an application, there should always be one coherent way for the user to implement actions. Though some shortcuts may be provided, users should always be able to rely on familiar and straightforward ways to get things done.  
The standard elements of the Apple Desktop Interface ensure consistency, ease of learning and familiarity across applications. This benefits the typical user, who usually divides working time among several applications, and it benefits every software developer because the user learning how to use a new application builds on prior experiences with the same elements in other applications. This sometimes means that a programmer's new solution that precisely matches a particular situation should be set aside in favor of a slightly less effective general solution: in most cases, consistency should be valued above idiosyncratic cleverness.
