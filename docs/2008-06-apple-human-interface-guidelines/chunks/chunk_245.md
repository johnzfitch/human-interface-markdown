A scope bar is a horizontal strip that can appear just below your application's toolbar. It can be visible at all times, but is usually invisible until the user initiates an operation such as a search or find.  
Although a scope bar may contain a search field control, it often contains only two types of controls, both of which are designed solely for use in a scope bar. The first control is the recessed-style scope button, which is used to display scoping locations and categories. The second is the round rectangle–style scope button, which is used to save or manipulate a scoping operation (for details on these controls, see ["Scope](#page-262-0) [Buttons"](#page-262-0) (page 263)).  
You can also display filter rows below a scope bar that allow users to specify additional rules that help refine the scoping operation. In addition to the round rectangle–style scope button (used for selecting or saving scoping criteria), a filter row can also contain text fields that accept user input. For example, when users search in the Finder, they can click the Add button to view a new row with supplementary rules they can use to refine their search. Figure 14-20 shows a Finder window with several filter rows displayed below the scope bar.
