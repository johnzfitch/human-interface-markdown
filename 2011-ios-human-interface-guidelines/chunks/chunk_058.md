iOS devices are personal devices, but they also encourage collaboration and sharing with others. Enhance your app by helping people collaborate and connect with others.  
**When appropriate, make it easy for people to interact with others and share things like their location, opinions, and high scores**. People generally expect to be able to share information that'simportant to them.  
Most applications can add value by allowing people to go beyond the application and share data with other tools they use. For example, an iOS application can act as a mobile complement to a computer application. Or, an iPad application might allow its users to communicate with the users of the iPhone version of the app.  
**For iPad, think of ways to allow more than one person to use your app on the same device**. For example, two people might be able to play a game on opposing sides of an onscreen board. Or a band application might allow different people to play different instruments together on a single device.
