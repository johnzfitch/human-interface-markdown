Because speech and sounds can be ambiguous, the speech-recognition process sometimes produces errors. Two such errors are the following:  
- A **rejection error** occurs when the system hears something it considers speech (rather than noise) but can't match the sound to a known command. By default, this kind of error returns "???"; your application can specify its own rejection word or other response.
- A **substitution error** occurs when the system incorrectly interprets a sound recognizing the command "cut" as "quit," for example.  
Because substitution errors are generally more annoying to users than rejection errors, the speech-recognition engine has been tuned to prefer to reject rather than substitute.  
With the "Listen for" AppleScript command, you can easily test your application's spoken commands without writing any code. Consult the Mac OS X Developer Tools CD for examples of using the speech-recognition server's "Listen for" command.
