#### **Required Keyboard Alternatives**

These keyboard alternatives must be used if the application implements the command. For example, if your application has a Find panel, you must provide Command-f as a way of bringing the panel up.

However, if an application doesn't implement the particular functionality of an item (if it doesn't have a Find panel, for example), it can use the keyboard alternative (Command-f) for something else. Nevertheless, to preserve interapplication consistency, it's strongly recommended that you first try to use characters that don't overlap with those on this list.
