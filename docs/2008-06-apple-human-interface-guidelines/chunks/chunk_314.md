**Control sizes**: Push buttons are available in regular, small, and mini sizes. The height of a push button is fixed for each size, but you specify the width, depending on the length of the label text you supply. If you don't specify a wide enough button, the end caps clip the text.

**Label spacing and fonts**: Push button label text should not have a shadow or any other effects on it, and it should be in the system font appropriate for the button size (these fonts are automatically supplied by Interface Builder):  
- Regular size: System font.
- Small: Small system font.
- Mini: Mini system font.  
**Control spacing**: Push buttons should be placed far enough from each other to allow the user to click a specific one easily. In particular, note that a push button that could lead to a potentially dangerous or destructive action (such as Delete)should be farther away from safe buttonsthan the distancesrecommended in this section (see ["Dismissing](#page-235-1) Dialogs" (page 236) for more information).  
- Regular size: Leave at least 12 pixels of space between buttons aligned horizontally or stacked vertically.
- Small: Leave at least 10 pixels of space between buttons aligned horizontally or stacked vertically.
- Mini: Leave at least 8 pixels of space between buttons aligned horizontally or stacked vertically.
