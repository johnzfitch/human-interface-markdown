### Don't:

- Overuse modes, including modal dialog boxes.
- Require using the keyboard for an operation that would be easier with the mouse, or require using the mouse for an operation that would be easier with the keyboard.
- Change the way the screen looks unexpectedly, especially by scrolling automatically more than necessary.
- Make up your own menus and then give them the same names as standard menus.
- Take an old-fashioned prompt-based application and pass it off as a mouse-based application.
