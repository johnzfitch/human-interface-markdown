#### The Main Menu  
Every NeXTSTEP application has at least one menu, its main menu. If an application has just a main menu, it holds all the commands for the application. If the application has more than one menu, all but the main menu are submenus of another menu. Through the hierarchical arrangement of submenus, the main menu gives the user access to all the menus of the application.  
Because the main menu is at the top of the menu hierarchy, it lacks a close button and always remains on-screen when its application is active.  
By default, when an application first starts up, its main menu appears in the upper left corner of the screen. Users can change this default location by dragging the main menu to a new position. Another way to change the default location for all applications (except those whose main menus have already been moved) is with the Preferences application.
