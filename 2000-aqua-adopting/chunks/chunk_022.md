Slider controls have a 7-pixel track. You can specify tick marks and labels. Several types of sliders (or "thumbs") are available. In each case, the slider size is 2 pixels larger than its equivalent in platinum appearance. Directional and non-directional sliders are available. Examples of vertical and horizontal slider controls are shown in [Figure 1-18.](#page-20-0)
