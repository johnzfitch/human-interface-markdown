Use a checkbox when you want to allow users to choose between two opposite states, actions, or values. If you want to provide a set of choices from which users can choose only one, use a set of radio buttons instead (see "Radio [Buttons"](#page-282-1) (page 283) for more on this control).  
If there are several independent values or states you want users to control, you can provide a group of checkboxes (seeFigure 15-23 for an example of agroup of independent checkboxes). If, on the other hand, you need to allow users to make an on-off type of choice that can lead to additional, related on-off choices, you can display checkboxes in a hierarchy that indicates the relationship.  
For example, the Trackpad pane of the Keyboard & Mouse preferences allows users to decide which trackpad gestures to use (this window is shown in Figure 15-24). Notice that the "Allow horizontal scrolling" checkbox is dependent on the "Use two fingers to scroll" checkbox, because if users choose  
*not* to use two fingers to scroll, they don't care about horizontal scrolling. Similarly, the Dragging and Drag Lock checkboxes are unavailable unless the Clicking checkbox is selected, because the dragging gestures are dependent on the clicking gesture. The Trackpad pane uses indentation to tell users that some of these settings are dependent on others.
