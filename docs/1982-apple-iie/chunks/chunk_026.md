The external appearance of the program is as simple as possible. The user does not get lost within a maze of branches. (You may safely assume that the first-time user has not read the manual.)  
The number of screens and menus is kept to a minimum. The ALF™ music editor and VisiCalc™ are excellent examples of this concept.  
Displays are kept clean and simple. Questions posed are clear and free of ambiguity.  
Fluidity: Movement within the program is easy and fluid. The structure is simple enough to allow the user to move from place to place without becoming confused.  
Tools: The user is provided with the necessary tools to work with the program. For example, in a personal finance program, an input requesting annual rent should allow an answer such as 435.00 \* 12 or 435.00 X 12, and not expect the user to work out the answer in his or her head. If a file name must be selected from the disk, those file names are either displayed or available for display.
