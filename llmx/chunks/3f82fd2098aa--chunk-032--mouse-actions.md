#### Mouse actions  
Simply moving the mouse just moves the pointer. All other events—changes to the information displayed on the screen—take place only when the **mouse button** is used.  
The user can do three things with the mouse button: click, press, and drag. Clicking happens when the user presses down on the mouse button and quickly releases while the mouse remains stationary. Pressing means holding the mouse button down for a time while the mouse remains stationary. Dragging involves pushing down the mouse button, moving the mouse (and the pointer) to a new location, then releasing the mouse button. With these few basic actions, the user can perform a wide range of tasks in a consistent way.
