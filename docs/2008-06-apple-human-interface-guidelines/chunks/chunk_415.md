**Control sizes**: Token field controls fit inside the standard sizes of text input fields. The heights of token field controls are fixed for each size, and their lengths are determined by the length of the token. The height of a token field control is a few pixels less than the height of the text input field that contains it:  
■ Regular size: 16 pixels high.  
■ Small: 14 pixels high.  
■ Mini: 11 pixels high.
