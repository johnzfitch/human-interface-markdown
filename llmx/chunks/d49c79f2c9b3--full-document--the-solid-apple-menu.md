# The Solid-Apple Menu

(4 in a MouseText-based application, Solid-Apple in a graphics-based application)

Desk accessories are mini-applications that you may make available to your user while using your application. You can enable a user to issue a command at any time to call up one of several desk accessories. More than one accessory can be on the desktop at a time. An example of a menu of accessories is shown in Figure 16.

The ? menu also contains the "About xxx" menu item, where "xxx" is the name of the application. Choosing this item brings up a dialog box with the name and copyright information for the application, as well as any other information the application wants to display.
