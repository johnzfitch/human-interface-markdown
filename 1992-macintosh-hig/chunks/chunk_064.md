Remember to think about your users and keep their interests foremost when making your design decisions. Market pressures can sometimes cause developers to try to implement features that they feel are necessary, even when they don't have the resources to develop those features fully. Because a good review in the press can make an application successful, developers are sensitive to meeting the expectations of reviewers as well as their target audiences. Many times reviews include information on whether or not applications have certain features and the right number of new features. The pressure of competition is intense, and developers may often feel that they must make decisions based on market pressures.
