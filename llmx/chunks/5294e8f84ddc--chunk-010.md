Computers easily adapt to the kind of rapid change that can disorient people. To give people a sense of stability, the Apple Desktop Interface provides a two-dimensional space on which objects are placed. The placement of these objects is constant unless the user moves them. The menu bar is always at the top of the screen, providing a stable element which frames changing displays. Most applications fill the screen when launched, but because users can usually move and shrink documents, the desktop is always there, as a stabilizing element.  
It is not necessary that the desktop be literally complete. Lots of features of "real" desktops—pencil sharpeners and gravity, to name just two—can safely be omitted. Stability results from a *consistent illusion*. It is the *perception* of stability that is critical.
