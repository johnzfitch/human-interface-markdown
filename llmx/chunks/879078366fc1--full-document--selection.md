## **Selection**

Users select graphical objects by clicking and dragging with the mouse. A variety of objects can be selected, including:

- Windows
- Tools in a palette
- Cells in a matrix or fields in a form
- Icons in a file viewer
- Items in a list (of files or mail messages, for example)
- Characters in editable text
- Graphical elements of editable artwork

Selecting an object simply picks it out and distinguishes it from others of the same type. It doesn't change the object in any way. Most selections pick out targets for subsequent actions in the targeted-action paradigm.

If users are allowed to insert new material into a display, they can select not only objects already displayed, but also locations for the insertions. For example, it's possible to select either characters that have already been typed into a text field or the point where new typing should appear.

This section concentrates on how selections are made in editable material, but the rules often carry over to other types of selection as well.
