<span id="page-129-3"></span>A **placard** is a control you can use to display information, such as the current page number. You can also use a placard to create the striped background behind other controls.  
Typically placards are used in document windows as a way to quickly modify the view of the contents—for example, to change the current page or the magnification. The most familiar use of the placard is as a pop-up menu placed at the bottom of a window to the left of the horizontal scroll bar. You can extend the functionality of a placard by, for example, having it provide a pop-up menu so that users can choose from pre-defined options.

Placards are 15 pixels high and use either 10-point or 11-point Lucida Grande Regular.  
Carbon developers can use the Carbon Control Manager CreatePlacardControl call or DrawThemePlacard in the Carbon Appearance Manager to create a placard.
