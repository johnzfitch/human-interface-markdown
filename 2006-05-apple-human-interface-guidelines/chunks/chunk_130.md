<span id="page-100-2"></span>Users may modify your application's keyboard shortcuts and some of the system in Keyboard & Mouse preferences. Even though users can remap keyboard shortcuts, you should adhere to the shortcuts recommended throughout this document. Doing so provides a more consistent user experience.
