**Group boxes**, like separators, are used to break a window into distinct logical areas. A group box provides a more pronounced separation than a separator. Use a group box when you want a set of controls to be perceived as a single element. Avoid putting too many controls in group boxes so they don't look cluttered.  
Group boxes can be untitled or titled. If titled, they may have text-only titles, checkbox titles, or pop-up menu titles. If the group box uses a checkbox title, the items in the group box should be active only when the checkbox is checked. Pop-up menu titles should either be centered or be 14 pixels from the left side of the group box.
