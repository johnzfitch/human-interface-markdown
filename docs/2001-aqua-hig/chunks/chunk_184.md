When the insertion point moves vertically in a text document, its horizontal position is maintained in terms of screen pixels, not characters (in other words, the insertion point could move from the twenty-fifth character in a line down to the fiftieth character, depending on the font and size). As the insertion point moves from line to line, keep it as close as possible to its original horizontal position, moving it slightly left or right to the nearest new character boundary.  
The Option and Command keys are used as semantic modifiers with the arrow keys. As a general rule, the Option key increases the size of the semantic unit by one compared to the arrow keys alone, and Command key enlarges the semantic unit again. The application determines what the semantic units are. In a word processor, typically the units are characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. In a spreadsheet, a basic semantic unit could be a cell.
