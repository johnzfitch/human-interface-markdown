If a user needs to be able to tap some text buttons or picture buttons in your application with a finger instead of a pen, you can use large buttons. If your large buttons won't fit at the bottom of a view, it's OK to put them along one side of the view. Put them only on one side, but be sure the user can choose whether they appear on the right or left. A user's left hand would block the whole screen while tapping large buttons along the right edge of the screen, so left-handed users need to be able to set an option that shifts large buttons from the right side to the left side of the screen. If your application includes large buttons and you want them to work when a user rotates the display (with the Extras Drawer), your application needs to be able to adjust the position of the large buttons for regular or sideways orientation of the display.
