(Note that these keys are the first four on the bottom row on the standard U.S. keyboard. If you translate a program to a keyboard with a different layout, you should change the actual characters typed so that they remain the first four keys on the bottom row.)  
- D Drag or move the currently active window
- G Grow or shrink (size) the currently active window
- M Mark a selection  
THE KEYBOARD 39  
Typing any of these combinations will place the accent, followed by a backspace character, in your file, so that the next character typed will be accented. Display the accent and the character linked by the solid-dash MouseText character ("S"). As the user cannot type a solid dash, there is no ambiguity.  
Your program should accept only valid accented characters, throwing away the dead-key character if, for example, a person types OPEN-APPLE-^ followed by an X.
