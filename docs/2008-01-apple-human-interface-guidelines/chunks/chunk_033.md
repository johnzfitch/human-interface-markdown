Allow the user, not the computer, to initiate and control actions. Some applications attempt to assist the user by offering only those alternatives deemed good for the user or by protecting the user from having to make detailed decisions. Because this approach puts the computer, not the user, in control, it is best confined to parts of the user interface aimed at novice users. Provide the level of user control that is appropriate for your audience (see "Know Your [Audience"](#page-26-2) (page 27) for more information on ways to determine the audience for your application). For some suggestions on how to provide the appropriate level of detail in your user interface, see "Managing [Complexity](#page-48-0) in Your [Software"](#page-48-0) (page 49).  
<span id="page-43-2"></span>The key is to provide users with the capabilities they need while helping them avoid dangerous, irreversible actions. For example, in situations where the user might destroy data accidentally, you should always provide a warning, but allow the user to proceed if they choose.
