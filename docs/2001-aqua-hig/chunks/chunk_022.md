Take advantage of people's knowledge of the world by using metaphors to convey concepts and features of your application. Use metaphors that represent concrete, familiar ideas and make the metaphors obvious, so users can apply a set of expectations to the computer environment. For example, the Macintosh uses the metaphor of file folders for storing documents; people can organize their hard disks in a way that's analogous to the way they organize file cabinets.  
Metaphors in the computer interface suggest a use for something, but that use doesn't necessarily define or limit the implementation of the metaphor. The Trash, for example, doesn't have to limit its contents to the number of items an actual wastebasket could contain. Try to strike a balance between the metaphor's suggested use and the computer's ability to support and extend the metaphor.
