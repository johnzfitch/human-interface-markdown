Animation is a great way to communicate effectively, as long as it doesn't get in the way of users' tasks or slow them down. Subtle and appropriate animation can:  
- Communicate status
- Provide useful feedback
- Enhance the sense of direct manipulation
- Help people visualize the results of their actions  
**Add animation cautiously, especially in applications that do not provide an immersive experience**. In applications that are focused on serious or productive tasks, animation that seems excessive or gratuitous can obstruct application flow, decrease performance, and distract users from the task.  
**Make animation consistent with built-in applications when appropriate**. People are accustomed to the subtle animation used in the built-in iOS applications. In fact, most people regard the smooth transitions between views, the fluid response to changes in device orientation, and the realistic flipping and scrolling as an expected part of the iOS experience. Unless you're creating an app that enables an immersive experience, such as a game, custom animation should be comparable to the built-in animations.  
**Use animation consistently throughout your app**. As with other types of customization, it's important to use custom animation consistently so that users can rely on the experience they gain with your app.
